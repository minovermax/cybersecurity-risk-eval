{"cik": "83246", "company": "HSBC USA INC /MD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion provides a description of the most significant risk factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in public statements or documents. Some of these risk factors are inherent in the financial services industry and others are more specific to our own businesses. However, other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and, therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of all potential risks that we may face.\nThe current uncertain market and economic conditions may continue to affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Our business and earnings are affected by general business, economic and market conditions in the United States and abroad. Given our concentration of business activities in the United States, we are particularly exposed to any additional turmoil in the economy, housing downturns, high unemployment, tighter credit conditions and reduced economic growth. While the U.S. economy continued to improve during 2014, challenges remain. We also have a significant number of customers in Latin America, which continues to experience inflation and other economic challenges. General business, economic and market conditions that could continue to affect us include:\n\u2022\nlevel of economic growth and the pace and magnitude of the recovery;\n\u2022\npressure on consumer confidence and consumer spending from other economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nfiscal policy;\n\u2022\nvolatility in energy prices;\n\u2022\nvolatility in credit markets;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels;\n\u2022\ntrends in corporate earnings;\n\u2022\nwage income levels and declines in wealth;\n\u2022\nmarket value of residential and commercial real estate throughout the United States;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nmonetary supply and monetary policy;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets in which we fund our operations;\n\u2022\nunexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nmovements in short-term and long-term interest rates or a prolonged period of low or negative interest rates;\n\u2022\navailability of liquidity;\n\u2022\ntight consumer credit conditions;\n\u2022\nbankruptcy filing levels and heightened scrutiny by various U.S. Bankruptcy Trustees of proofs of claim and other documents filed by creditors in consumer bankruptcy cases; and\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or regulatory and law enforcement initiatives.\nIn a challenging economic environment, more of our customers are likely to, or have in fact, become delinquent on their loans or other obligations as compared with historical periods as many of our customers experience reductions in cash flow available to service their debt. These delinquencies, in turn, have adversely affected our earnings. Although unemployment rates have improved in 2014 and housing market conditions in the U.S. continue to recover, if businesses remain cautious to hire, additional losses could be significant in all types of our consumer loans due to decreased consumer income. While the U.S. economy continued to improve in 2014, the sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. In the event economic conditions stop improving or become depressed and lead to a recession, there would be a significant negative impact on delinquencies, charge-offs and losses in all loan portfolios with a corresponding impact on our results of operations. While the recovery may be positive in the United States, it can have a simultaneous negative effect on currencies and stock markets in emerging economies such as those in Latin America, which could have a negative impact on our loan portfolio for our Latin American clients, with a corresponding impact on our results of operations.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of the recovery varies by market. The combination of foreclosure documentation scrutiny and new rules or statutes relating to foreclosures has led to a significant backlog of foreclosures which will take time to resolve. Mortgage lenders have substantially tightened lending standards since 2007. Furthermore, our loan portfolio was impacted by the declining home values and erosion of homeowner's equity and the resulting difficulty some\nHSBC USA Inc.\nborrowers had refinancing their mortgages, particularly in cases where government programs for high loan to value refinancing were not available. This, in turn, impacted both credit performance and run-off rates which resulted in elevated delinquency rates for real estate secured loans in our portfolio.\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our financial planning products and services.\nFederal, state and other similar international measures to regulate the financial industry may significantly impact our operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment. Changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting banking, derivatives, capital, liquidity, consumer credit, bankruptcy, privacy, consumer protection or other matters, including changes in tax rates, could materially impact our operations and performance.\nAttempts by local, state and national regulatory agencies to address perceived problems with the mortgage lending and credit card industries and, more recently, to address additional perceived problems in the financial services industry generally through broad or targeted legislative or regulatory initiatives aimed at lenders\u2019 operations in consumer lending markets, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of products we can offer, how these products may be originated, the fees and charges that may be applied to accounts and how accounts may be collected or security interests enforced. Any one or more of these effects could negatively impact our results. There is also significant focus on loss mitigation and foreclosure activity for real estate loans. We cannot fully anticipate the response by national regulatory agencies, state Attorneys General, or certain legislators, or if significant changes to our operations and practices will be required as a result.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit, payment and other consumer financial products and services. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may also narrow the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expand the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's potential expansion of the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, we could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs. Although we are unable to predict what specific measures the CFPB may take in applying its regulatory mandate, any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in our consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries, including HSBC Bank USA, have registered as swap dealers and are now subject to extensive oversight by the CFTC. Regulation of swap dealers by the CFTC imposes numerous corporate governance, business conduct, capital, margin, reporting, clearing, execution and other regulatory requirements on HSBC Bank USA which may adversely affect our derivatives business and make us less competitive or make certain derivative products less profitable to undertake. Although many significant regulations applicable to swap dealers are already in effect, we are unable at this time to determine the full impact of these requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also required the U.S regulatory agencies to adopt rules to implement the Volcker Rule, which is intended in part to prohibit institutions such as HSBC USA from engaging in proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, or sponsoring or having certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund subject to certain exemptions. A final rule implementing the Volcker Rule was published on December 10, 2013 extending the rule\u2019s conformance period to July 2015. In December 2014, the FRB further extended by order the conformance period to July 21, 2016 for investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (\"legacy covered funds\"). The FRB also indicated that it intends to act next year to grant an additional one-year extension, until July 21, 2017, for the same legacy covered fund investments and relationships. The final rule requires extensive regulatory interpretation and subjects HSBC USA to further supervisory oversight by U.S. regulatory agencies. While the final Volcker Rule contains exemptions for market-making, underwriting, risk-mitigating hedging, and certain transactions on behalf of customers and activities in certain asset classes, clearly defining all the parameters of these exemptions and requirements requires additional interpretation by U.S. regulatory agencies. Trading activities engaged in by HSBC USA are subject to restrictions designed to ensure compliance with the final Volcker Rule and HSBC USA is currently developing extensive compliance policies and procedures. The final Volcker Rule also restricts acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, or sponsoring or having certain relationships with, \u201ccovered funds\u201d, which generally include entities that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, but for the exemptions provided in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of such Act, as well as certain commodity pools. The final Volcker Rule includes exemptions, among others, for certain limited investments in conjunction with asset management activities for customers, for loan securitizations, for asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and for underwriting and market making in covered funds. As with the proprietary trading restrictions, the exemptions are generally subject to a variety of compliance requirements and conditions. Any limited, yet permissible, investments in covered funds are required to be deducted from the Tier 1 capital of banking entities. The final Volcker Rule also requires an extensive array of compliance policies, procedures and quantitative metrics reporting to ensure that activities\nHSBC USA Inc.\nremain within one or more of the exemptions described in the final Volcker Rule. Compliance with the Volcker Rule will likely increase our operational and compliance costs, reduce our trading revenues, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe FRB has also issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and the early remediation requirements established under the Dodd-Frank Act. The enhanced standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, and stress test requirements. The FRB has issued final rules requiring covered entities to undergo annual stress tests conducted by the FRB and conduct their own \u201ccompany-run\u201d stress tests twice a year in conjunction with the CCAR program. Final regulations addressing early remediation requirements and single-counterparty credit limits have not yet been adopted, and are likely to impose additional operational and compliance costs on us once they are finalized.\nOur indirect parent, HSBC North America, is subject to assessment by the FRB as part of the CCAR program, which includes annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB as well as semi-annual company-run stress tests as required under the DFAST. CCAR is an annual exercise by the FRB to ensure that institutions have forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their risks and sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. We cannot be certain that the FRB will have no objections to our 2015 or future capital plans submitted through the CCAR program. If we do not pass the CCAR review it could adversely affect our ability to make distributions, including dividends on our preferred stock and trust preferred securities, or to enter into acquisitions.\nHSBC Bank USA is also required under the Dodd-Frank Act to undergo annual DFAST, company-run stress testing based on the OCC\u2019s stress scenario assumptions that runs concurrently with, and is submitted at the same time as, CCAR. HSBC Bank USA is required to publish the results of the DFAST. If our stress testing projections differ significantly from our peers or the FRB objects to HSBC North America\u2019s capital plan, this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation since CCAR and DFAST results are made public. See also \"Our reputation has a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations\" below.\nThe total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will respond to the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations under the legislation, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect our businesses and operations. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the U.S., the European Union (\"EU\") or in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Regulators in the EU and in the U.K.are in the midst of proposing far-reaching programs of financial regulatory reform. These proposals include enhanced capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, changes in compensation practices (including tax levies), separation of retail and wholesale banking, the recovery and resolution of EU financial institutions, amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the Market Abuse Directive, and measures to address systemic risk. Furthermore, certain large G-SIBs, including HSBC, will be subject to capital surcharges and other enhanced prudential requirements. While the Financial Stability Board (\"FSB\") has identified HSBC as one of the two G-SIBs that would be subject to a 2.5 percent surcharge, the G-SIB surcharge has not yet been formally implemented in the U.K. The FRB's proposal to implement the G-SIB surcharge in the United States would only apply to U.S. G-SIBs and would not impose additional capital requirements on us. The FSB has also issued a proposal for a TLAC for G-SIBs, which would apply to our ultimate parent, HSBC, and its material subsidiaries, which may include HSBC USA. The proposed TLAC requirements would be a significant extension of the current regulatory capital framework and could require G-SIBs to issue additional long-term debt or make material modifications to terms of the debt instruments they have outstanding. The TLAC proposal has not yet been finalized by the FSB or formally implemented in the U.S. or the U.K.\nThe implementation of regulations and rules promulgated by these bodies could result in additional costs or limit or restrict the way HSBC conducts its businesses in the EU and, in particular, in the U.K. Furthermore, the potentially far-reaching effects of future changes in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement as a result of EU or U.K. legislation and regulation are difficult to predict and could adversely affect HSBC USA\u2019s operations.\nFailure to implement our obligations under the deferred prosecution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results and operations. In December 2012, HSBC, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA entered into agreements to achieve a resolution with U.S. and U.K. government agencies regarding past inadequate compliance with AML/BSA and sanctions laws, including the previously reported investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the FRB, the OCC and FinCEN in connection with AML/BSA compliance, including cross-border transactions involving our cash handling business in Mexico and banknotes business in the U.S., and historical transactions involving parties subject to OFAC economic sanctions. As part of the resolution, HSBC and HSBC Bank USA entered into the five-year U.S. DPA with the U.S. Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia, and HSBC entered into the two-year DANY DPA with the New York County District Attorney, and HSBC consented to a cease and desist order and a monetary penalty order with the FRB. In addition, HSBC Bank USA entered into a monetary penalty\nHSBC USA Inc.\nconsent order with FinCEN and a separate monetary penalty order with the OCC. HSBC also entered into an undertaking with the U.K. Financial Services Authority, now a FCA Direction, to comply with certain forward-looking obligations with respect to AML and sanctions requirements over a five-year term.\nUnder these agreements, HSBC and HSBC Bank USA made payments totaling $1.921 billion to U.S. authorities, of which $1.381 billion was attributed to and paid by HSBC Bank USA, and are continuing to comply with ongoing obligations. Over the five-year term of the agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice and the FCA, an independent monitor (who is, for FCA purposes, a \"skilled person\" under Section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act) will evaluate HSBC's progress in fully implementing its obligations, and will produce regular assessments of the effectiveness of HSBC's compliance function. Michael Cherkasky was selected as the independent monitor. In July 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered an order approving the U.S. DPA pursuant to the court's supervisory power and granting the parties' application to place the case in abeyance for five years. The court will maintain supervisory power over the implementation of the U.S. DPA while the case is in abeyance.\nHSBC fulfilled all of the requirements imposed by the DANY DPA and accordingly the agreement expired at the end of the two year period in December 2014. If HSBC and HSBC Bank USA fulfill all of the requirements imposed by the U.S. DPA, the U.S. Department of Justice's charges against those entities will similarly be dismissed at the end of the five-year period of that agreement. The U.S. Department of Justice may prosecute HSBC or HSBC Bank USA in relation to the matters that are subject of the U.S. DPA if HSBC or HSBC Bank USA breaches the terms of the U.S. DPA.\nHSBC Bank USA, as dollar clearer for all U.S. dollar transactions for HSBC globally, manages significant AML risk in the global correspondent banking area because of the breadth and scale of that area, especially as it relates to transactions involving affiliates and global correspondent banks in high risk AML jurisdictions. A significant AML violation in this area or the utilization of the global affiliate and correspondent banking network by terrorists or other perpetrators of financial crimes could have materially adverse consequences under the U.S. DPA or our other consent agreements. The design and execution of AML and sanctions remediation programs is complex, requiring major investment in people, systems and other infrastructure. This complexity creates significant execution risk, which could impact our ability to effectively manage financial crime risk and remedy AML and sanctions compliance deficiencies in a timely manner. This could, in turn, impact our ability to satisfy monitor or comply with the terms of the U.S. DPA, and may require us to take additional remedial measures in the future. Breach of the U.S. DPA at any time during its term may allow the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute HSBC or HSBC Bank USA in relation to the matters which are the subject of the U.S. DPA.\nIn the event of the prosecution of criminal charges, there could be significant collateral consequences to HSBC and its affiliates, including potential restrictions on our ability to operate in the U.S., loss of business or licenses, withdrawal of funding and harm to our reputation, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the settlement with regulators does not preclude private litigation relating to, among other things, HSBC's compliance with applicable AML, BSA and sanctions laws, which, if determined adversely, may result in judgments, settlements or other results that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm.\nThird parties may use us as a conduit for illegal activities without our knowledge, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with applicable AML laws and regulations and have adopted various policies and procedures, including internal control and \u2018know your customer\u2019 procedures, aimed at preventing the use of HSBC products and services for the purpose of committing or concealing financial crime. A major focus of U.S. and U.K. government policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and enforcing compliance with U.S. and E.U. economic sanctions, and this prioritization is evidenced by our agreements with U.S. and U.K. authorities relating to various investigations regarding past inadequate compliance with AML and sanctions laws. We and certain of our affiliates have entered into a consent cease and desist order with the OCC and a similar consent order with the FRB which requires the implementation of improvements to compliance procedures regarding obligations under the BSA and AML rules. These consent orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies or private litigation.\nIn relevant situations, and where permitted by regulation, we may rely upon certain counterparties to maintain and properly apply their own appropriate AML procedures. While permitted by regulation, such reliance may not be completely effective in preventing third parties from using us (and our relevant counterparties) as a conduit for money laundering, including illegal cash operations without our knowledge (and that of our relevant counterparties). Becoming a party to money laundering, association with, or even accusations of being associated with money laundering would damage our reputation and could make us subject to fines, sanctions and/or legal enforcement (including being added to \u2018blacklists\u2019 that would prohibit certain parties from engaging in transactions with us). Any one of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nA number of the remedial actions taken or being taken as a result of the matters to which the U.S. DPA relates are intended to ensure that we and the other HSBC Group businesses are better protected from these risks. However, there can be no assurance\nHSBC USA Inc.\nthat we will not have to take additional remedial measures in the future. Breach of the U.S. DPA at any time during its term may allow the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute HSBC and HSBC Bank USA in relation to the matters which are the subject of the U.S. DPA.\nFailure to comply with the GLBA Agreement would have an adverse material effect on our results and operations. As reflected in the GLBA Agreement entered into with the OCC on December 11, 2012, the OCC has determined that HSBC Bank USA is not in compliance with the requirements set forth in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24a(a)(2)(c) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.39(g)(1), which provide that a national bank and each depository institution affiliate of the national bank must be both well capitalized and well managed in order to own or control a financial subsidiary. As a result, HSBC USA and its parent bank holding companies no longer meet the qualification requirements for financial holding company status and may not engage in any new types of financial activities without the prior approval of the FRB. In addition, HSBC Bank USA may not directly or indirectly acquire control of, or hold an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, nor commence a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, unless it receives prior approval from the OCC. If all of our affiliate depositary institutions are not in compliance with these requirements within the time periods specified in the GLBA Agreement, as they may be extended, HSBC USA could be required either to divest HSBC Bank USA or to divest or terminate any financial activities conducted in reliance on the GLB Act. Similar consequences could result for subsidiaries of HSBC Bank USA that engage in financial activities in reliance on expanded powers provided for in the GLB Act. Any such divestiture or termination of activities would have an adverse material effect on the consolidated results and operation of HSBC USA.\nOur reputation has a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations. Our ability to attract and retain customers and conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation, or the reputation of affiliates operating under the HSBC brand, is damaged. Our failure to address, or to appear to fail to address, various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to us and our business prospects. Reputational issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nnegative news about us, HSBC, our affiliates or the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nappropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nethical issues, including alleged deceptive or unfair lending or pricing practices;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering and economic sanctions programs;\n\u2022\nprivacy issues;\n\u2022\nfraud issues;\n\u2022\ndata security issues related to our customers or employees;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity issues and cyber incidents, whether actual, threatened, or perceived;\n\u2022\nrecordkeeping;\n\u2022\nsales and trading practices;\n\u2022\ncustomer service;\n\u2022\nactions of a vendor or other third party we do business with;\n\u2022\nthe proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our businesses;\n\u2022\nalleged irregularities in servicing, foreclosure, consumer collections, mortgage lending practices and loan modifications;\n\u2022\na downgrade of or negative watch warning on any of our credit ratings; and\n\u2022\ngeneral company performance.\nThe proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets.\nThe failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address any of these issues appropriately could make our customers unwilling to do business with us or give rise to increased regulatory action, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur risk management measures may not be successful. The management of risk is an integral part of all our activities. Risk constitutes our exposure to uncertainty and the consequent variability of return. Specifically, risk equates to the adverse effect on profitability or financial condition arising from different sources of uncertainty including retail and wholesale credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, compliance risk, fiduciary risk, concentration risk, liquidity and funding risk, litigation risk, reputational risk, strategic risk, security and fraud risk, model risk, pension obligation risk and regulatory risk. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and the judgments that\nHSBC USA Inc.\naccompany their application cannot anticipate every unfavorable event or the specifics and timing of every outcome. Failure to manage risks appropriately could have a significant adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. We are exposed to many types of operational risks that are inherent in banking operations, including fraudulent and other criminal activities (both internal and external), breakdowns in processes or procedures and systems failure or non-availability. These risks apply equally when we rely on outside suppliers or vendors to provide services to us and our customers. These operational risks could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, there is a risk that our operating system controls as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to disruption from the external environment. We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems infrastructure arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include:\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, electrical, telecommunications, or other essential utility outages;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes or other severe weather conditions and earthquakes;\n\u2022\nevents arising from local, regional or international politics, including terrorist acts; or\n\u2022\nabsence of operating systems personnel due to global pandemics or otherwise, which could have a significant effect on our business operations as well as on HSBC affiliates world-wide.\nSuch disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers, an inability to collect our receivables in affected areas and other loss or liability to us.\nA failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. Data integrity is critical for our risk and compliance functions as well as for decision making and operational processes. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process a large number of complex transactions, most of which involve, in some fashion, networked computing devices. Data integrity and accurate reporting systems influence all levels of management decision making, enterprise risk management, governance and our ability to meet our regulatory requirements. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing and other recordkeeping systems and management controls fail, or are subject to cyberattack that could compromise integrity, availability or confidentiality of our systems or data, we could be materially adversely affected.\nIn recent years, distributed denial of service (\"DDoS\") attacks, spearphishing campaigns, advanced malware and insider threats have grown in volume and level of sophistication each with the intent to obtain personal customer financial information or proprietary corporate information. Such acts can affect our business by:\n\u2022\ncompromising the confidentiality or integrity of our customers' data, potentially impacting our customer\u2019s ability to repay loan balances and negatively impacting their credit ratings;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur remediation and other costs related to liability for customer or third parties for losses, repairs to remedy systems flaws, or incentives to customers and business partners to maintain and rebuild business relationships after the attack;\n\u2022\nincreasing our costs to respond to such threats and to enhance our processes and systems to ensure security of data;\n\u2022\ndamaging our reputation as a result of public disclosure of a breach of our systems or a loss of data event;\n\u2022\nresulting in unauthorized disclosure or alteration of our corporate confidential information and confidential information of employees, customers and counterparties;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our and customers' or third parties' business operations; and\n\u2022\nresulting in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nThe threat from cyberattacks is a concern for our organization and failure to protect our operations from internet crime or cyberattacks may result in financial loss and loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine our reputation and our ability to attract and keep customers. We face various cyber risks in line with other multinational financial organizations. We and other multinational financial organizations have been, and will continue to be subject to an increasing risk of cyber incidents from these activities due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet and customers use of personal smartphones, PCs and other computing devices, tablet PCs and other mobile devices to access products and services to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime for seeking financial gain, hacktivists (geopolitical designated groups), cyberterrorists (attacks against critical infrastructure) and state sponsored advanced persistent threats (\"APTs\") for corporate espionage. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among\nHSBC USA Inc.\nother things, HSBC Group\u2019s prominent size and scale and role in the financial services industry, and our offering of Internet banking and mobile banking platforms that serve our customers when and how they want to be served. In addition, the consolidation of clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of financial institutions with such central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the exposure of cyberattacks on critical parties may affect us. Evaluating and monitoring the cyberthreat landscape in comparison to our existing capabilities, and adjusting our programs in order to respond to these threats, may require additional capital expenses for human resources and technology.\nDuring 2014, we experienced two DDoS attacks against our external facing systems in the U.S. A DDoS attack is the intentional disruption of a computer network by flooding it with data sent simultaneously from many individual computers. Both attacks occurred in January of 2014, the first on January 5, 2014, resulting in a service disruption of 30 minutes and the second on January 22, 2014, resulting in a 26 minute service disruption to our personal Internet banking and business to business Internet banking environments and various other brochure-ware websites. We did not experience any other direct attacks in 2014. Although the DDoS attacks had limited effect and there was no data loss, there can be no assurance that future targeted attacks from activities of organized crime, hacktivists, cyberterrorists and state sponsored APTs will not result in reputational damage, service disruption and the loss of data.\nWe may suffer losses due to employee negligence or misconduct. Non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct, negligence and fraud could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. We are dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if an employee or employees, acting alone or in concert with non-affiliated third parties, causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems, including, without limitation, by means of cyberattack or denial-of-service attack. In recent years, a number of multinational financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of \u2018rogue traders\u2019 or other employees. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective.\nWe may suffer losses due to employee negligence or misconduct on the part of third parties. We depend on third party suppliers, outsource providers and our affiliates for a variety of services. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including risks relating to break-downs or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. The OCC and FRB require financial institutions to maintain third party and service provider risk management programs, which include due diligence requirements for third parties and service providers as well as for our affiliates who may perform services for us. Under FRB guidance \u201cservice providers\u201d is broadly defined to include all entities that have entered into a contractual relationship with a financial institution to provide business functions or activities. If our third party risk and service provider management and due diligence program is not sufficiently robust, this could lead to regulatory intervention. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nFailure to successfully change our operational practices may have a material impact on our businesses. Changes to operational practices from time to time could materially positively or negatively impact our performance and results. Such changes may include:\n\u2022\nour determining to acquire or sell residential mortgage loans and other loans or the decision to sell credit card receivables;\n\u2022\ndecision to outsource our mortgage servicing business;\n\u2022\nchanges to our customer account management and risk management/collection policies and practices;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nour increasing investment in technology, business infrastructure and specialized personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges to our AML and sanctions policies and the related operations practices; or\n\u2022\nour outsourcing of various operations.\nFurther, in order to react quickly to or meet newly-implemented regulatory requirements, we may need to change or enhance systems within very tight time frames, which would increase operational risk. Failure to implement changes to our operational practices successfully and efficiently may diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses and could result in reputational damage and regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nFederal Reserve Board policies can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"). Its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nThe delivery of our regulatory priorities is subject to execution risk. The financial services industry is currently facing an unprecedented period of scrutiny. Additionally, we are subject to a number of consent orders with our regulators. Regulatory requests, legal matters and business initiatives all require a significant amount of time and resources to implement. The magnitude and complexity of projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk. Organizational change and external factors, including the challenging macroeconomic environment and the extent and pace of regulatory change also contribute to execution risk. These factors could adversely affect the successful delivery of our regulatory priorities.\nEconomic uncertainty related to U.S. markets could negatively impact our business operations and our access to capital markets. Concerns regarding U.S. debt and budget matters have caused uncertainty in financial markets in the recent past. The downgrading of U.S. debt ratings in the future, as well as any future concerns about raising the U.S. debt limit could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operations of our business and our financial results and condition. Additionally, macroeconomic or market concerns related to the lack of confidence in the U.S. credit and debt ratings may prompt outflows from our funds or accounts. The subsequent deterioration of consumer confidence may diminish the demand for the products and services of our consumer business, or increase the cost to provide such products and services.\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from the financial crisis and continued challenging economic conditions. We target internationally mobile clients who need sophisticated global solutions and generally compete on the basis of the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued and increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. Additionally, if our products and services are not accepted by our targeted clients, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the current economic, regulatory, and political environment for large financial institutions such as us, and possible public backlash to bank fees, there is increased competitive pressure to provide products and services at current or lower prices. Consequently, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the actions of our competitors who may or may not charge similar fees for their products and services. Any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customers and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, new technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers.\nContinued technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic payment solutions. We may not respond effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing products and services or develop new products and services to respond to our customers\u2019 needs.\nWe have significant exposure to counterparty risk. We are exposed to counterparties that are involved in virtually all major industries, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in financial services, including brokers and dealers, central clearing counterparties, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. Our ability to engage in routine transactions to fund our operations and manage our risks could be materially adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. Financial institutions are necessarily interdependent because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a consequence, a default by, or decline in market confidence in, individual institutions, or anxiety about the financial services industry generally, can lead to further individual and/or systemic difficulties, defaults and losses.\nMandatory central clearing of over the counter derivatives, including under the Dodd-Frank Act, brings new risks to us. As a clearing member, we will be required to underwrite losses incurred at a Central Counterparty (\"CCP\") by the default of other clearing members and their clients. Hence central clearing brings with it a new element of interconnectedness between clearing members and clients which we believe may increase rather than reduce our exposure to systemic risk. At the same time, our ability to manage such risk ourselves will be reduced because control has been largely outsourced to CCPs and it is unclear at present how, at a time of stress, regulators and resolution authorities will intervene.\nWhere bilateral counterparty risk has been mitigated by taking collateral, our credit risk may remain high if the collateral we hold cannot be realized or has to be liquidated at prices which are insufficient to recover the full amount of our loan or derivative exposure. There is a risk that collateral cannot be realized, including situations where this arises by change of law that may influence our ability to foreclose on collateral or otherwise enforce contractual rights.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nWe also have credit exposure arising from mitigants such as credit default swaps (\"CDSs\"), and other credit derivatives, each of which is carried at fair value. The risk of default by counterparties to CDSs and other credit derivatives used as mitigants affects the fair value of these instruments depending on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the underlying instrument against which protection has been purchased. Any such adjustments or fair value changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial condition of our clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect us. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that we could incur in our market-making and clearing businesses.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a consequence, a default by, or decline in market confidence in, individual institutions, or anxiety about the financial services industry generally, can lead to further individual and/or systemic difficulties, defaults and losses. HSBC routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. When such a counterparty or client becomes bankrupt or insolvent, we may become entangled in significant disputes and litigation with the counterparty's or client's bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations, all of which can increase our operational and litigation costs.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity, our credit risk also may be further increased when we cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by us or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to us. Further, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity.\nIncreased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. The credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices and higher unemployment, or other factors. For example, changes in borrower behavior or the regulatory environment also could influence recognition of credit losses in the portfolio and our allowance for credit losses.\nWhile we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2014, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings.\nConcentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. We have exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. While we regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks, our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of our positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations.\nDue to our strategy to serve the banking needs of an international customer base, a number of the loans with our owned mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of loans to borrowers without traditional U.S. credit. For example, approximately 9 percent of our mortgage books is comprised of borrowers without traditional U.S. credit. Despite risk management mitigation, there is inherently higher uncertainty around loss rates due to the lack of detailed historic credit information on each borrower.\nOur inability to meet funding requirements due to deposit attrition or access to the capital markets. HSBC USA is a holding company without operations of its own and therefore relies on dividends and other distributions for a portion of its funding and liquidity. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Our primary source of funding is deposits, augmented by issuance of commercial paper and term debt. Adequate liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nWe also access wholesale markets in order to provide funding for entities that do not accept deposits, to align asset and liability maturities and currencies and to maintain a market presence. We issued a total of $8,088 million of long-term debt at various points in 2014, including $2,250 million of senior notes issued in June 2014 and $2,450 million of senior notes issued in November 2014. An inability to obtain financing in the unsecured long-term or short-term debt capital markets could have a substantial adverse effect on our liquidity. Unfavorable macroeconomic developments, market disruptions or regulatory developments may increase our funding costs or challenge our ability to raise funds to support our businesses, materially adversely affecting our business, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nDespite the apparent improvements in overall market liquidity and our liquidity position, future conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include:\n\u2022\nan inability to attract or retain deposits because customers may invest in other financial instruments as an alternative;\n\u2022\ndiminished access to capital markets;\n\u2022\nan increased interest rate environment for our commercial paper, deposits or term debt;\n\u2022\nunforeseen cash or capital requirements;\n\u2022\nan inability to sell assets; and\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain expected funding from HSBC Group subsidiaries and clients.\nThese conditions could be caused by a number of factors, including internal and external factors, such as, among others:\n\u2022\nfinancial and credit market disruption;\n\u2022\nvolatility or lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets;\n\u2022\nlack of market or customer confidence in HSBC or negative news about us or the financial services industry generally; and\n\u2022\nother conditions and factors over which we have little or no control including economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and concerns over potential government defaults and related policy initiatives, the potential failure of the U.S. to raise the debt limit and the ongoing European debt crisis.\nHSBC has provided capital support in the past and has indicated its commitment and capacity to fund the needs of the business in the future. If we are unable to raise funds through deposits and/or in the capital markets, our liquidity position could be adversely affected and we might be unable to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, or to fund new loans, investments and businesses. We may need to liquidate unencumbered assets to meet our liabilities. In a time of reduced liquidity, we may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we may need to sell assets at depressed prices, which in either case could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funding as well as the value of our debt obligations. Our credit ratings are an important part of maintaining our liquidity. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, which consider a number of factors including their assessment of our relative financial strength and results of operations, including our strategy and our management's capability, as well as factors affecting the financial services industry generally, including legal and regulatory frameworks affecting our business activities and the rights of our creditors. There can be no assurance that downgrades will not occur. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could potentially increase our borrowing costs, impact our ability to issue commercial paper and, depending on the severity of the downgrade, substantially limit our access to capital markets, require us to make cash payments or post collateral and permit termination by counterparties of certain significant contracts. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. In February 2015, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (\"S&P\") took various rating agency actions on certain European banks, including HSBC, following a review of government support. As a result of this review, the long-term debt rating of HSBC USA was downgraded to A and the long-term debt rating of HSBC Bank USA was put on negative watch. As part of this review, the short-term ratings of both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA were re-affirmed. It is not anticipated that the actions taken by S&P will significantly impact our funding cost or strategy. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. For example, in addition to the S&P action mentioned above, Moody's published in September 2014 a request for comment regarding proposed material revisions to the form and content of its global bank rating methodology, the core elements of which have been in place since 2007. This proposal may impact up to 40 percent of all local currency bank deposit ratings globally, with changes heavily concentrated among European and U.S. banks. Additionally, Moody's published in January 2015 a request for comment regarding new counterparty risk ratings which will be distinct from debt, deposit or issuer ratings in that it will measure default probability rather than expected loss, and will apply to counterparty obligations and contractual commitments rather than debt or deposit instruments. This new rating will provide an opinion on a bank's counterparty risk related to its covered bonds, contractual performance obligations (e.g. servicing), derivatives (e.g. swaps), letters of credit, certain guarantees and liquidity facilities. Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there\nHSBC USA Inc.\nis no assurance that our credit ratings will not be changed in the future. As of December 31, 2014, there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies other than wide ranging reviews in process and those items mentioned above.\nFinancial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may negatively affect our servicing and investment portfolios. Our servicing portfolio includes certain mortgage loans that carry some level of insurance from one or more mortgage insurance companies. To the extent that any of these companies experience financial difficulties or credit downgrades, we may be required, as servicer of the insured loan on behalf of the investor, to obtain replacement coverage with another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we would replace. We may be responsible for some or all of the incremental cost of the new coverage for certain loans depending on the terms of our servicing agreement with the investor and other circumstances, although we do not have an additional risk of repurchase loss associated with claim amounts for loans sold to third-party investors. Similarly, some of the mortgage loans we hold for investment or for sale carry mortgage insurance. If a mortgage insurer is unable to meet its credit obligations with respect to an insured loan, we might incur higher credit losses if replacement coverage is not obtained. We also have investments in municipal bonds that are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. The value of these bonds and the payment of principal and interest on them may be negatively affected by financial difficulties or credit downgrades experienced by the bond insurers.\nOur \"cross-selling\" efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy, and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results. Selling more products to our customers - \"cross-selling\" - is very important to our business model and key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings especially during the current environment of slow economic growth and regulatory reform initiatives. Key among these cross-sell opportunities is the collaboration between CMB and GB&M, which is an area where many of our competitors also focus. In RBWM many of our competitors also focus on cross-selling, especially in retail banking and mortgage lending. In both instances, this can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices, reducing our net interest income and revenue from our fee-based products. It could also affect our ability to keep existing customers. New technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers. Our cross-sell strategy also is dependent on earning more business from our HSBC customers, and increasing our cross-sell ratio - or the average number of products sold to existing customers - may become more challenging.\nThe value of our mortgage servicing rights could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates or the failure to comply with serving standards. As a residential mortgage servicer in the U.S., we have a portfolio of MSRs, which is in run-off. An MSR is the right to service a mortgage loan - collect principal, interest and escrow amounts - for a fee, which prior to the conversion of our mortgage processing and servicing operations to PHH Mortgage Corporation (\"PHH Mortgage\"), we retained when we sold originated mortgage loans. Beginning with May 2013 applications, we now sell our GSE-eligible mortgage originations to PHH Mortgage on a servicing released basis which results in no new servicing rights being recognized.\nPrior to our strategic relationship with PHH Mortgage, MSRs were recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time loans were sold. We initially valued MSRs at fair value at the time the related loans were sold and subsequently measure MSRs at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur. Fair value is the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. MSRs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Any decrease in the fair value of our MSRs will reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs, which can result in earnings volatility. While interest rate risk is mitigated through an active hedging program, hedging instruments and models that we use may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged and, as a result, a reduction in the fair value of our MSRs could have a significant adverse impact on our earnings in a given period.\nAdditionally, the GSEs that own the mortgages that we service in our MSR portfolio have mortgage servicing standards. The failure to comply with these standards could result in penalties assessed by the GSEs or force us to sell all or part of our MSR portfolio.\nLawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings may continue and increase in the current economic and regulatory environment. In the ordinary course of business, HSBC USA and its affiliates are routinely named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current and/or former operations and are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and formal and informal proceedings, as described in Note 28, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, remediation payments, injunctions and other relief. There is no certainty that the litigation will decrease in the near future, especially in the event of continued unemployment rates, a resurgent recession or additional regulatory and law enforcement investigations and proceedings by federal and state governmental agencies.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nFinancial service providers are at risk of regulatory sanctions or fines related to conduct of business and financial crime. The incidence of regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial service firms is increasing, with a corresponding increase also in civil litigation arising from or relating to issues which are subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions or fines. In the current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the financial services industry, there may be additional regulatory investigations and reviews conducted by banking and other regulators, including the CFPB, state Attorneys General or state regulatory and law enforcement agencies that, if determined adversely, may result in judgments, settlements, substantial fines, penalties, remediation payments or other results, including additional compliance requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. In addition, criminal prosecutions of financial institutions for, among other alleged conduct, breaches of AML and sanctions regulations, antitrust violations, market manipulation, aiding and abetting tax evasion, and providing unlicensed cross-border banking services, have become more commonplace and may increase in frequency due to increased media attention and higher expectations from prosecutors and the public. Any such prosecution or investigation of, or legal proceeding or regulatory action brought against, HSBC or one or more of its subsidiaries could result in substantial fines, penalties and/or forfeitures and could have a material adverse effect on our results, business and prospects, including the potential loss of key licenses, requirement to exit certain businesses and withdrawal of funding from depositors and other stakeholders. See \"Failure to implement our obligations under the deferred prosecution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results and operations\" and \"We may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes and the industry-wide delay in processing foreclosures may have a significant impact upon loss severity\" above.\nWe establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. It is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of many of the legal, regulatory and other adversarial proceedings involving our businesses, particularly those cases in which matters are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, those which seek unspecified damages or those which involve novel legal claims. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes and the industry-wide delay in processing foreclosures may have a significant impact upon loss severity. As previously reported, HSBC Bank USA entered into the OCC Servicing Consent Order with the OCC and our affiliate, HSBC Finance, and our common indirect parent, HSBC North America entered into a similar consent order with the FRB following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry foreclosure practices.\nThe OCC Servicing Consent Order requires HSBC Bank USA to take prescribed actions to address the foreclosure practice deficiencies described in the consent order. We continue to work with our regulators to align our processes with the requirements of the Servicing Consent Orders and implement operational changes as required, however, we are not yet in compliance with all requirements of the OCC Servicing Consent Order. The failure of HSBC Bank USA to satisfy all requirements of the OCC Servicing Consent Order could subject HSBC Bank USA to a variety of regulatory consequences, including the imposition of civil money penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Servicing Consent Orders required an independent review of foreclosures pending or completed between January 2009 and December 2010 to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. We refer to this as the Independent Foreclosure Review. On February 28, 2013, HSBC Bank USA entered into an agreement with the OCC, and HSBC Finance and HSBC North America entered into an agreement with the FRB, which we refer to as the \"IFR Settlement Agreements, pursuant to which the Independent Foreclosure Review ceased and HSBC North America made a cash payment of $96 million into a fund used to make payments to borrowers that were in active foreclosure during 2009 and 2010 and, in addition, is providing other assistance (e.g., loan modifications) to help eligible borrowers. As a result, in 2012, we recorded expenses of $19 million which reflects the portion of HSBC North America's total expense of $104 million that we believe is allocable to us. As of December 31, 2014, Rust Consulting, Inc., the paying agent, has issued almost all checks to eligible borrowers. See Note 28, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCompliance related costs have permanently increased to higher levels due to the remediation requirements of the Servicing Consent Orders. In addition, the Servicing Consent Orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions against HSBC Bank USA or our affiliates by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Justice or state Attorneys General, which could include the imposition of civil money penalties and other sanctions relating to the activities that are the subject of the Servicing Consent Orders.\nFurther, the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review does not preclude future private litigation concerning these practices. Separate from the Servicing Consent Orders and the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review discussed above, in February 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and state Attorneys General of 49 states announced a settlement with the five largest U.S. mortgage servicers with respect to foreclosure\nHSBC USA Inc.\nand other mortgage servicing practices. HSBC Bank USA, together with our affiliate HSBC Finance, have had discussions with U.S. bank regulators and other governmental agencies regarding a potential resolution, although the timing of any settlement is not presently known. We recorded an accrual of $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 (which was reduced by $6 million in the second quarter of 2013) reflecting the portion of the HSBC North America accrual that we currently believe is allocable to HSBC Bank USA. As this matter progresses and more information becomes available, we will continue to evaluate our portion of the HSBC North America liability which may result in a change to our current estimate. Any such settlement, however, may not completely preclude other enforcement actions by state or federal agencies, regulators or law enforcement agencies relating to foreclosure and other mortgage services practices, including, but not limited to, matters relating to the securitization of mortgages for investors, including the imposition of civil money penalties, criminal fines or other sanctions. In addition, these practices have in the past resulted in private litigation and such a settlement would not preclude private litigation concerning foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices.\nBeginning in late 2010, we temporarily suspended all new foreclosure proceedings and in early 2011 temporarily suspended foreclosures in process where judgment had not yet been entered while we enhanced foreclosure documentation and processes for foreclosures and re-filed affidavits where necessary. We have resumed processing suspended foreclosure activities in substantially all states and have now referred the majority of the backlog of loans for foreclosure. We have also begun initiating new foreclosure activities in substantially all states. The number of new real estate owned (\"REO\") properties added to inventory will continue to be impacted due to certain states having foreclosure timelines that have extended.\nIn addition, certain courts and state legislatures have issued new rules or statutes relating to foreclosures. Scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to a significant backlog of foreclosures which will take time to resolve. If these trends continue, there could be additional delays in the processing of foreclosures, which could have an adverse impact upon housing prices which is likely to result in higher loss severities while foreclosures are delayed.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses relating to mortgage loan repurchases and other mortgage loan securitization-related activities. In connection with our loan sale and securitization activities with Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\") (the \"Government Sponsored Entities\" or \"GSEs\") and loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, HUSI has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. For transactions with the GSEs, these representations include type of collateral, underwriting standards, validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan, that primary mortgage insurance is in force for any mortgage loan with a loan-to-value ratio (\"LTV\") greater than 80 percent, and the use of the GSEs\u2019 standard legal documentation. We may be, and have been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other private investors for losses due to breaches of representations and warranties.\nIn estimating our repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider several factors, including the level of outstanding repurchase demands in inventory and our historical defense rate, the level of outstanding requests for loan files and the related historical repurchase request conversion rate and defense rate, the level of potential future demands based on historical conversion rates of loans for which we have not received a loan file request but are two or more payments delinquent or expected to become delinquent at an estimated conversion rate and any settlements reached with our counterparties. While we believe that our current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above are dependent on economic factors, investor demand strategies, housing market trends and other circumstances, which are beyond our control and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future.\nWe have also been involved as a sponsor/seller of loans used to facilitate whole loan securitizations underwritten by our affiliate, HSI, and serve as trustee of various securitization trusts. Participants in the U.S. mortgage securitization market that purchased and repackaged whole loans have been the subject of lawsuits and governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries, which have been directed at groups within the U.S. mortgage market, such as servicers, originators, underwriters, trustees or sponsors of securitizations, and at particular participants within these groups. As the industry's residential foreclosure issues continue, HSBC Bank USA has taken title to an increasing number of foreclosed homes as trustee on behalf of various securitization trusts. As nominal record owner of these properties, HSBC Bank USA has been sued by municipalities and tenants alleging various obligations of law, including laws regarding property upkeep and tenants' rights. While we believe and continue to maintain that the obligations at issue and any related liability are properly those of the servicer of each trust, we continue to receive significant and adverse publicity in connection with these and similar matters, including foreclosures that are serviced by others in the name of \"HSBC, as trustee.\" We expect this level of focus will continue and, potentially, intensify, so long as the U.S. real estate markets continue to be distressed. As a result, we may be subject to additional litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our participation in the U.S. mortgage securitization market, either individually or as a member of a group.\nIn October 2014, U.S. regulators adopted a joint final rule requiring sponsors of asset-backed securitization transactions to retain 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets subject of the securitization. At a general level, the rule permits sponsors to satisfy the risk retention requirement through the acquisition and retention of either 5 percent (measured by fair value) of the most subordinated\nHSBC USA Inc.\ninterest in the securitization, or 5 percent (measured by nominal value) of each tranche of interests issued by the securitization, or some combination of the two. The rule also permits certain exceptions and methods of compliance specific to specific types of asset-backed securities transactions. The final rule will take effect for residential mortgage-backed securities transactions on December 24, 2015, and for other securitization transactions, on December 24, 2016. The specific impact of the final rule on different asset backed securities markets is uncertain and will vary, and certain asset-backed securities markets may result in fewer issuances or reduced liquidity, or both, and there may in certain markets be an impact on the assets acquired by securitizations.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other reference rates may adversely impact the value of debt securities and other financial instruments we hold or issue that are linked to such reference rates and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. As a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of the daily LIBOR, a number of British Bankers\u2019 Association (the \"BBA\") member banks entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged manipulation of LIBOR, and there are ongoing investigations by regulators and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions. Following a review of LIBOR conducted at the request of the U.K. Government, on September 28, 2012, recommendations for reforming the setting and governing of LIBOR were released (the \"Wheatley Review\"). The Wheatley Review made a number of recommendations for changes with respect to LIBOR, including the introduction of statutory regulation of LIBOR, the transfer of responsibility for LIBOR from the BBA to an independent administrator, changes to the method of compilation of lending rates and new regulatory oversight and enforcement mechanisms for rate-setting and a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is published. Based on the Wheatley Review and on a subsequent public and governmental consultation process, on March 25, 2013, the U.K. Financial Services Authority published final rules for the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s regulation and supervision of LIBOR (the \"FCA Rules\"). In particular, the FCA Rules include requirements that (1) an independent LIBOR administrator monitor and survey LIBOR submissions to identify breaches of practice standards and/or potentially manipulative behavior, and (2) firms submitting data to LIBOR establish and maintain a clear conflicts of interest policy and appropriate systems and controls. The FCA Rules took effect on April 2, 2013. In early 2014, NYSE Euronext Rate Administration Ltd. became the independent LIBOR administrator. Similar changes may occur with respect to other reference rates. Various regulators and competition and enforcement authorities are conducting investigations and reviews related to certain past submissions made by panel banks and the processes for making submissions in connection with the setting of the European interbank offered rates and other benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would impact the value of any debt securities we hold or issue that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or any loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit we hold or are due to us, or for which we are an obligor, that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or whether, or to what extent, such changes would impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulatory requirements in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the future orderly resolution of large financial institutions could negatively impact our business structures, activities and practices. The Dodd-Frank Act requires HSBC as a foreign bank holding company and our ultimate parent to prepare and submit annually a plan for the orderly resolution of the U.S. businesses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of future material financial distress or failure. The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on reducing risks to the U.S. financial system, requiring a plan to demonstrate how the relevant entities can be resolved in a \"rapid and orderly\" fashion in a manner that avoids systemic risks. Similarly, HSBC Bank USA must prepare and submit an annual resolution plan under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. HSBC Bank USA is required to regularly provide a plan to the FDIC that is executable for resolving the bank in the event of its failure that protects depositors, maximizes the net present value return on assets and minimizes the amount of any losses to creditors, including the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund. These plans must include information on resolution strategy, major counterparties and \"interdependencies,\" among other things, and require substantial effort, time and cost across all of our businesses and geographies. These resolution plans are subject to review by the FRB and the FDIC.\nIf the FRB and the FDIC both determine that these resolution plans are not \"credible\" (which, although not defined, is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plans are feasible or would otherwise allow the regulators to resolve the U.S. businesses in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss), and we do not remedy the deficiencies within the required time period, we could be required to restructure or reorganize businesses, legal entities, or operational systems and intra-company transactions in ways that could negatively impact operations, or be subject to restrictions on growth. We could also eventually be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or be required to divest certain assets or operations.\nThe transition to the new requirements under Basel III will continue to put significant pressure on regulatory capital and liquidity. HSBC North America is required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance, in accordance with current regulatory timelines. In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued \u201cBasel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\u201d (the \u201cBasel III Capital Framework\u201d) and \u201cInternational framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring\u201d (the \u201cBasel III Liquidity Framework\u201d) (together, \"Basel III\"). In October 2013, the U.S. banking regulators published a final rule in the Federal Register implementing the Basel III Capital Framework and the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier\nHSBC USA Inc.\n1 capital, which we refer to as the \u201cBasel III Final Rule\u201d. The Basel III Final Rule establishes new minimum capital and buffer requirements to be phased in by 2019 and also requires the deduction of certain assets from capital, within prescribed limitations, and the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income or \"OCI\" in capital. The Basel III Final Rule also increases capital requirements for counterparty credit risk and introduces a SLR that must be publicly disclosed beginning January 1, 2015 and will become a binding measure January 1, 2018. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA began complying with the effective portions of the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2014. In September 2014, the U.S. banking regulators adopted revisions to the SLR to align it with the final Basel leverage framework adopted in January 2014. These changes expanded the denominator of the SLR to include derivatives and securities financing transactions. The Basel III Final Rule and the subsequent revisions to the SLR will materially increase our regulatory capital requirements over the next several years.\nIn addition to the Basel III Final Rule, there continue to be numerous proposals or potential proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as HSBC North America, as well as our ability to meet these requirements. The FSB has issued a proposal for a total loss-absorbing capacity requirement for G-SIBs, which, if adopted and implemented as proposed, could require our ultimate parent, HSBC, and HSBC USA, to issue additional long term debt or modify the terms of certain outstanding debt instruments. The FRB has also indicated it is considering proposals relating to the use of short-term wholesale funding by financial institutions, particularly SFTs, which could include a capital surcharge based on the institution\u2019s reliance on such funding, and/or increased capital requirements applicable to SFT matched books. Accordingly, there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding significant portions of the capital regime that will apply to HSBC North America and, as a result, the ultimate impact these capital requirements will have on our long term capital planning and the results of our operations.\nFurther increases in regulatory capital may also be required in response to other U.S. supervisory requirements relating to capital. The exact amount, however, will depend upon our prevailing risk profile and that of our North America affiliates under various stress scenarios. Participation by HSBC North America in the FRB\u2019s CCAR stress test process will also require that HSBC North America maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum regulatory ratios including a 5 percent Tier 1 common ratio (as defined by the FRB) over a nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon, which could also require increased capital to withstand the application of the stress scenarios over the planning horizon. HSBC Bank USA is also required to participate in the OCC\u2019s DFAST, that runs concurrently with, and is submitted at the same time as, the CCAR. These stress testing requirements will influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.\nThe Basel Committee has adopted two minimum liquidity risk measures which are applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The LCR measures the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under a significant 30-day stress scenario. The NSFR measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The FRB, the OCC and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the LCR with stricter requirements and a faster implementation timeline than the Basel Committee has established. Under the final rules, certain large banking institutions such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and are required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to change their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules. The U.S. regulators have not yet issued a proposal to implement the NSFR for U.S. banking organizations. HSBC USA may need to increase its liquidity profile to support HSBC North America's compliance with these future rules.\nPreparation for Basel III has influenced and is likely to continue to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and is expected to impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. We are unable at this time to determine the extent of changes HSBC USA will need to make to its liquidity or capital position, if any, and what effect, if any, such changes will have on our results of operations or financial condition. New regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital and may require us to increase our capital or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results.\nManagement projections, estimates and judgments based on historical performance may not be indicative of our future performance. Our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine loan loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangibles, among other items. In particular, loan loss reserve estimates and certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management\u2019s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control. To the extent historical averages of the progression of loans into stages of delinquency or the amount of loss realized upon charge-off are not predictive of future losses and management is unable to accurately evaluate the portfolio risk factors not fully reflected in historical models, unexpected additional losses could result. Similarly, to the extent assumptions employed in measuring fair\nHSBC USA Inc.\nvalue of assets and liabilities not supported by market prices or other observable parameters do not sufficiently capture their inherent risk, unexpected additional losses could result.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or shareholders\u2019 equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans, future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies, including capital support from HSBC necessary as part of such plans and strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates, and the application of inherently complex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our deferred tax assets.\nOur financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any \"material weaknesses\" in our internal control. In a company as large and complex as ours, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and we cannot assure you that we will not find one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given year.\nChanges in accounting standards are beyond our control and may have a material impact on how we report our financial results and condition. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"), the SEC and our bank regulators, including the OCC and the FRB, change the financial accounting and reporting standards, or the interpretation thereof, and guidance that govern the preparation and disclosure of external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report and disclose our financial results and condition, including our segment results. For example, the FASB's financial instruments project could, among other things, significantly change how we value our receivables portfolio, which could also affect the level of deferred tax assets that we recognize. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. We may, in certain instances, change a business practice in order to comply with new or revised standards.\nKey employees may be difficult to retain due to contraction of the business and limits on promotional activities. Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. If we were unable to continue to attract and retain qualified key employees to support the various functions of our businesses, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Our financial performance, reductions in variable compensation and other benefits could raise concerns about key employees\u2019 future compensation and opportunities for promotion. Any future limitations on executive compensation imposed by legislation or regulation could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified employees. As economic conditions improve, we may face increased difficulty in retaining top performers and critical skilled employees. The demands being placed on our employees are unprecedented. The cumulative workload arising from a regulatory reform program that is often extra-territorial and still evolving is hugely consumptive of human resources, placing increasingly complex and conflicting demands on a workforce where the required expert capabilities are in short supply and globally mobile. If key personnel were to leave us and equally knowledgeable or skilled personnel are unavailable within the HSBC Group or could not be sourced in the market, our ability to manage our business, in particular through any future difficult economic environment may be hindered or impaired.\nSignificant reductions in pension assets may require additional financial contributions from us. Effective January 1, 2005, our previously separate qualified defined benefit pension plan was combined with that of HSBC Finance\u2019s into a single HSBC North America qualified defined benefit plan. At December 31, 2010, the defined benefit plan was frozen, significantly reducing future benefit accruals. At December 31, 2014, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $490 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 21, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.\nWe may not be able to meet regulatory requests for data. New regulatory requirements necessitate more frequent reporting, which requires accurate, detailed, consistent and timely management information and analysis to be produced. Inadequate\nHSBC USA Inc.\nmanagement information systems or processes could lead to a failure to meet our regulatory reporting obligations or other internal or external information demands. Financial institutions that fail to comply with the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may face supervisory measures.\nHSBC USA Inc.", "PERMNO": 53938, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HBC2"}
