{"cik": "1429764", "company": "Car Charging Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\tRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors are the most significant risk factors deemed by the Company, however, they are not the only risk factors affecting the Company.\nRelating to Our Business\nWE NEED TO MANAGE GROWTH IN OPERATIONS TO MAXIMIZE OUR POTENTIAL GROWTH AND ACHIEVE OUR EXPECTED REVENUES AND OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH WILL CAUSE A DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS RESULTING IN THE FAILURE TO GENERATE REVENUE AND IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS.\nIn order to maximize growth in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must expand our marketing operations. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect.\nIn order to achieve the above-mentioned targets, the general strategies of our Company are to maintain and search for hard-working employees who have innovative initiatives; as well as to keep a close eye on expansion opportunities through merger and/or acquisition.\nThe Company has sustained operating and cash flow losses since inception through the year ended December 31, 2014 forming a basis for performing an impairment test of its electric charger fixed asset group in accordance with ASC 360-10-Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The Company performed a recoverability test on these chargers and for the chargers which failed the test, measured and recorded an impairment charge as applicable. The key assumptions used in the estimates of projected cash flows utilized in both the test and measurement steps of the impairment analysis were projected revenues and related host payments. These forecasts were based on actual revenues for the eight months ended May 31, 2015 and take into account recent developments as well as the Company\u2019s plans and intentions. Based upon the results of the discounted cash flow analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge on certain chargers of $631,011 during the year ended December 31, 2014 representing the excess of net book value as of December 31, 2014 over the fair value of the related chargers.\nIF WE NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND OUR GROWING OPERATIONS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL AND MAY BE FORCED TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS; THE REPORT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM CONTAIN AN EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH THAT EXPRESSES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.\nIf adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms, we may not be able to undertake expansion or continue our marketing efforts and we would have to modify our business plans accordingly. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our financial statements as of December 31, 2014 and for the year then ended indicates that our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The report states that, since we have incurred net losses since inception and we need to raise additional funds to meet our obligations and sustain our operations, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans in regard to these matters are described in footnote 2 to our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and for the years then ended, which are included following Item 15 (\u201cExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d). Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIn connection with our growth strategies, we may experience increased capital needs; accordingly, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our future operations without additional capital investments. Our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products and/or services by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in research and development; (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions, and (v) our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.\nEven if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are acceptable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders. In addition, new equity or convertible debt securities issued by us to obtain financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We cannot give you any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.\nOUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON THE PERFORMANCE AND CONTINUED SERVICE OF OUR OFFICERS.\nWe are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of Michael Calise, Michael D. Farkas, Andy Kinard, Ira Feintuch and Jack Zwick, our management team. The loss of services of Mr. Calise, Mr. Farkas, Mr. Kinard, Mr. Feintuch or Mr. Zwick could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nOUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL.\nOur future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Expansion of our business and the management and operation of the Company will require additional managers and employees with industry experience, and our success will be highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and other employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. As our industry continues to evolve, competition for skilled personnel with the requisite experience will be significant. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified managers and employees.\nWE ARE IN AN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH OUR COMPETITORS WHO MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES.\nThe Company could face strong competition from competitors in the EV charging services industry who could duplicate the model. These competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and development resources and other capabilities than the Company. In addition, there are very few barriers to enter into the market for our services. There can be no assurance, therefore, that any of our competitors, many of whom have far greater resources, will not independently develop services that are substantially equivalent or superior to our services. Therefore, an investment in the Company is very risky and speculative due to the competitive environment in which the Company operates.\nOUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE FUTURE GENERATION OF A MARKET FOR OUR SERVICE.\nThe Company currently remains and will continue to remain in a position of dependence on the creation and sustainability of the electric car market. While a vast majority of the major car manufacturers have made strong financial commitments to the electric vehicle industry going forward, there is no guaranty that the industry will become viable. Without a fleet of electric vehicles on the road needing recharging, there exists no opportunity for the Company to provide its intended service. Therefore, an investment in the Company is very risky and speculative due to the uncertain future of the electric vehicle market.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nOUR PRIOR FAILURE TO PREPARE AND FILE TIMELY OUR PERIODIC REPORTS WITH THE SEC LIMITS US FROM ACCESSING THE PUBLIC MARKETS TO RAISE DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, OUR COMMON STOCK IS NOT CURRENTLY RULE 144 ELIGIBILE AND WE ARE UNABLE TO FILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE TERMS OF A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON JULY 24, 2015 WITH EVENTIDE.\nWe have not filed Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 or September 30, 2015. Because we are not current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. Our limited ability to access the public markets could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business. As a result of our failure to file our SEC filings by the filing date required by the SEC (including the grace period permitted by Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), our Common Stock is not eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Accordingly, investors and holders of our common stock may not be able to sell their stock until we are current under the 1934 Act.\nIn addition, on July 24, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Eventide Gilead Fund (\u201cEventide\u201d) whereby Eventide purchased shares of preferred stock and warrants in the Company and the Company agreed to file a Registration Statement within 120 calendar days following the Closing Date to register such shares and warrant shares. We cannot file a Registration Statement until we are current in our Exchange Act filings and therefore, may be subject to penalties from Eventide.\nTHE COMPANY HAS ONLY PROVIDED CONSOLIDATED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF CCGI AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING 350 GREEN LLC AND BLINK NETWORK LLC. THE SEC MAY DETERMINE THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TWO YEARS OF HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 350 GREEN LLC AND BLINK NETWORK LLC, AND MAY DEEM OUR FILINGS NOT CURRENT.\nWe have provided two years of consolidated post-acquisition financial statements for all of our subsidiaries, including 350 Green LLC and Blink Network LLC. However, we have not provided two years of historical (pre-acquisition) financial statements for 350 Green LLC and Blink Network LLC. The SEC may determine that because we have been unable to provide these financial statements, we are not current in our filings. This would limit our access to the public markets to debt or equity capital. We would also be unable to file a Registration Statement on Form S-1. Additionally, our shares would not be Rule 144 eligible, and our investors and holders of our common stock would not be able to sell their stock until we are current again.\nIF WE FAIL TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY OR PREVENT FRAUD. ANY INABILITY TO REPORT AND FILE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY AND TIMELY COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCOAB\u201d) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2014 our internal controls over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d) were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:\n1. We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year ended December 31, 2014. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n2. We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company\u2019s ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n3. We do not have personnel with sufficient experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address complex transactions.\n4. We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between non-financial and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.\n5. We have determined that oversight over our external financial reporting and internal control over our financial reporting by our audit committee is ineffective. The audit committee has not provided adequate review of the Company\u2019s SEC\u2019s filings and consolidated financial statements and has not provided adequate supervision and review of the Company\u2019s accounting personnel or oversight of the independent registered accounting firm\u2019s audit of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statement.\nWe have taken steps to remediate some of the weaknesses described above, including by engaging a financing consultant with expertise in accounting for complex transactions. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit.\nOUR COMMON STOCK IS CURRENTLY QUOTED ONLY ON THE OTC PINK MARKETPLACE (\u201cOTCPink\u201d), WHICH MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR STOCK PRICE AND LIQUIDITY.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCPink. The OTCPink is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. The quotation of our shares on the OTCPink may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Market liquidity will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result holders of our securities may not find purchasers for our securities should they to desire to sell them. Consequently, our securities should be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our securities for an indefinite period of time.\nOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE VERY THINLY TRADED, AND THE PRICE MAY NOT REFLECT OUR VALUE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.\nOur shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price, if traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to increase awareness of the Company with investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock as collateral for loans.\nFUTURE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OPTIONS AND WARRANTS COULD DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF EXISITNG STOCKHOLDERS.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock, options and warrants in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock, options and warrants could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, or the exercise of a substantial number of warrants and options either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nTHE APPLICATION OF THE SECURITY AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\u2019S \u201cPENNY STOCK\u201d RULES TO OUR COMMON STOCK COULD LIMIT TRADING ACIVITY IN THE MARKET, AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SELL THEIR STOCK.\nOur common stock continues to trade at less than $5.00 per share and is therefore subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (\u201cSEC\u201d) penny stock rules. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nWE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AND YOU MUST RELY ON INCREASES IN THE MARKET PRICES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR RETURNS ON YOUR INVESTMENT.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 17313, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "BLNK"}
