The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. You should consider these risks and uncertainties carefully, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nOur business is dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur pipeline includes three late-stage product candidates that could have a profound impact on the lives of patients: glycopyrronium tosylate (formerly DRM04), for which a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (underarm sweating beyond what is needed for normal body temperature regulation); olumacostat glasaretil (formerly DRM01), in Phase 3 development for the treatment of acne vulgaris; and lebrikizumab, in Phase 2b development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate any revenue in the future, will primarily depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our late-stage product candidates. In the future, we may also become dependent on other product candidates that we may in-license, acquire or develop. The clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ntimely completion of our clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors as well as our ability to timely recruit and enroll patients in our clinical trials, which may be delayed due to numerous factors, including the prevalence of other companies\u2019 clinical trials for their product candidates for the same or similar indications;\n\u2022\nwhether we are required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies beyond those planned to support the approval and commercialization of our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nacceptance of our proposed indications and primary endpoint assessments relating to the proposed indications of our product candidates by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nour ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities the safety, efficacy and acceptable risk to benefit profile of our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects experienced with our product candidates or future product candidates or approved products, if any;\n\u2022\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining, and, where applicable, ensuring that our third-party contractors achieve and maintain, compliance with our contractual obligations and with all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates or any future product candidates or approved products, if any;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain the substances and materials used in our product candidates from third parties and to have finished products manufactured by third parties in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical testing and commercialization;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties with whom we contract to manufacture clinical trial and commercial supplies of our product candidates or any future product candidates, remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d);\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile during clinical development and following approval of our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates in the United States and internationally, if approved for marketing, reimbursement, sale and distribution in such countries and territories, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, payers and patients of the benefits, safety and efficacy of our product candidates or any future product candidates, if approved, including relative to alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to establish and enforce intellectual property rights in and to our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims; and\n\u2022\nour ability to in-license or acquire additional product candidates that we believe can be successfully developed and commercialized.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our product candidates. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of our product candidates or any future product candidates to continue our business.\nWe have had significant and increasing operating expenses and we will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, which we may not be able to obtain when needed and on acceptable terms, or at all. We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, which could cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our business and prospects. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since we commenced operations in August 2010. We have incurred net losses of $303.3 million, $89.1 million and $78.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $553.4 million.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities. Since our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our product candidates. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on our future expenses and our ability to generate revenue, if any. Revenue from our current and potential future collaborations is uncertain because milestones or other contingent payments under our agreements may not be achieved or received.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and investments of $551.0 million. We will continue to expend substantial cash resources for the foreseeable future for the clinical development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and development of any other indications and product candidates we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with any acquisition or in-license of products and product candidates, technologies or businesses, research and development, conducting preclinical studies, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing and supply, regulatory submissions, preparing for potential commercial approvals and product launches, as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the conduct and results of any clinical trial are highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our current and any future product candidates.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2017 are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into the second half of 2019 and to: complete and generate topline results from our ongoing Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials for olumacostat glasaretil and Phase 2b dose-ranging study for lebrikizumab; commercialize our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate, assuming that we receive the necessary regulatory approvals; complete registration-enabling activities and submit an NDA to the FDA for potential approval related to olumacostat glasaretil assuming the data from our Phase 3 clinical trials are positive; and continue potential lifecycle management activities related to our product candidates. We have based these estimates, however, on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available capital resources much faster than we currently expect or require more capital to fund our operations than we currently expect. Our currently anticipated expenditures for the development and potential commercialization of all of our current product candidates, glycopyrronium tosylate, olumacostat glasaretil and lebrikizumab, exceed our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and continue to support our planned research and development and commercialization activities.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing, rate of progress and cost of any preclinical and clinical trials and other product development activities for our current and any future product candidates that we develop, in-license or acquire;\n\u2022\nthe results of the clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States and any foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, FDA approval and any foreign regulatory approval of our product candidates, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of any additional future product candidates we develop or acquire;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;\n\u2022\ncosts relating to building our infrastructure to prepare for potential commercial launch of our products, which will be incurred even if our product candidates are not ultimately approved for sale;\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities if our current or any future product candidates are approved for sale, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u2022\nthe degree and rate of market acceptance of any approved products;\n\u2022\ncosts under our third-party manufacturing and supply arrangements for our current and any future product candidates and any products we commercialize;\n\u2022\ncosts and timing of completion of any additional outsourced commercial manufacturing or supply arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022\nwhether we are required to assume manufacture and supply responsibilities for lebrikizumab drug substance (see \u201c-We are dependent on Roche for the manufacture and supply of lebrikizumab drug substance. If Roche elects to transfer its manufacture and supply responsibilities to us, we may not be able to engage a qualified contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply the drug substance in a timely manner, if at all. Any interruption in our supply may cause serious delays in the timing of our clinical studies, increase our costs and adversely impact our financial results.\u201d);\n\u2022\ncosts of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product candidates, including post-grant challenges or opposition to third-party patent claims;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with prosecuting or defending any litigation that we may become involved in and any damages payable by us that result from such litigation;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with defending any government investigations or enforcement actions including legal costs and fines;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with any product recall that could occur;\n\u2022\ncosts of operating as a public company;\n\u2022\nthe emergence, approval, availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing products or treatments;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with any acquisition or in-license of products and product candidates, technologies or businesses; and\n\u2022\npersonnel, facilities and equipment requirements.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nIn order to fund the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, we may also need to enter into collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our ability to establish and maintain these collaborations is highly uncertain and subject to a number of variables. Under these arrangements, we may be responsible for substantial costs in connection with the clinical development, regulatory approval or the commercialization of a partnered product candidate. Furthermore, the payments we could receive from our potential collaboration partners may be subject to numerous conditions and may ultimately be insufficient to cover the cost of this development and commercialization.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue one or more of our product development programs or our commercialization efforts, or other aspects of our business plan. In addition, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.\nClinical drug development for our product candidates is very expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. Our clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nClinical drug development for our product candidates is very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of a product candidate, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate is both safe and effective for use in the target indication. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization. The clinical trials for these product candidates may take significantly longer than expected to complete. In addition, we, any partner with which we currently or may in the future collaborate, the FDA, an institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) or other regulatory authorities, including state and local agencies and counterpart agencies in foreign countries, may suspend, delay, require modifications to or terminate our clinical trials at any time, for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndiscovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials or the failure of our product candidates to meet specified endpoints;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials resulting from numerous factors, including the prevalence of other companies\u2019 clinical trials for their product candidates for the same indication, such as acne;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in retaining subjects who have initiated participation in a clinical trial but may withdraw at any time due to adverse side effects from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or for any other reason;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining IRB approval for studies to be conducted at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in manufacturing or obtaining, or inability to manufacture or obtain, sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or the product formulation or method of delivery;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws, regulations and regulatory policies;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective CROs, clinical trial sites and other third-party contractors;\n\u2022\ninability to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n\u2022\nfailure of our CROs or other third-party contractors to comply with contractual and regulatory requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022\nfailure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees or any partner with which we may collaborate or their employees to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials or the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for drug and biologic products;\n\u2022\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n\u2022\nfailure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data; or\n\u2022\ninsufficient data to support regulatory approval.\nIn the case of our topical product candidates, we are seeking to deliver sufficient concentrations of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) through the skin barrier to the targeted dermal tissue to achieve the intended therapeutic effect. As a result, safety and efficacy can be difficult to establish. The topical route of administration may involve new dosage forms, which can be difficult to develop and manufacture and may raise novel regulatory issues and result in development or review delays. For example, the dosage form for glycopyrronium tosylate is an API-saturated wipe, and we are not aware of previous FDA approvals of prescription drug wipes. In addition, it is possible that the FDA may require more exposure of individuals to glycopyrronium tosylate than we have collected in our safety database. If we are required to expose additional individuals to glycopyrronium tosylate in order to establish a safety database sufficient for approval, approval of glycopyrronium tosylate, if at all, could be delayed and our costs could increase.\nWe or any partner with which we may collaborate may suffer significant setbacks in our clinical trials similar to the experience of a number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. In the event that we or our potential partners abandon or are delayed in the clinical development efforts related to our product candidates, we may not be able to execute on our business plan effectively and our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would be harmed. For example, if additional clinical trials of glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis are required, and we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, the clinical trials, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates. The delay, limitation or denial of any regulatory approval would adversely impact commercialization, our potential to generate revenue, our business and our operating results.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale, and we may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of our current or future product candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, safety surveillance, efficacy, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, distribution, import, export and reporting of safety and other post-market information related to our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and in foreign countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market any of our current product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA, biologics license application (\u201cBLA\u201d) or other applicable regulatory filing from the FDA. We are also not permitted to market any of our current product candidates in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the applicable regulatory authorities of such countries.\nTo gain approval to market a new drug such as glycopyrronium tosylate or olumacostat glasaretil or a biologic product such as lebrikizumab, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities must receive preclinical, clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and controls data that adequately demonstrate the safety, purity, potency, efficacy and compliant manufacturing of the product for the intended indication applied for in an NDA, BLA or other applicable regulatory filing. The development and approval of new drug products and biologic products involves a long, expensive and uncertain process. A delay or failure can occur at any stage in the process. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, including in Phase 3 clinical development, even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we or our partners may conduct. For example, in one of the two glycopyrronium tosylate Phase 3 trials, glycopyrronium tosylate demonstrated statistically significant results compared to vehicle for the objective measurement of sweat production only following exclusion of extreme outlier data from one analysis center in accordance with the pre-specified statistical analysis plan submitted to the FDA. The FDA may determine that we did not achieve statistically significant results for this objective measurement in this trial and may require us to conduct an additional Phase 3 study as a result of the extreme outlier data, and approval of glycopyrronium tosylate, if at all, could be delayed and our costs would increase. Further, as one of the primary assessments of efficacy in our glycopyrronium tosylate Phase 3 trials, we used a new patient-reported outcome assessment (\u201cPRO\u201d), the Axillary Sweating Daily Diary, the sweating severity item of which was validated in our Phase 2 clinical program to assess efficacy in a subjective manner. This PRO has not been previously used in an NDA filing to support potential approval of a product and the FDA may determine that is not sufficient to support approval.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with the design, implementation, choice of dose, analysis plans, or interpretation of the outcome of one or more clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not deem a product candidate safe and effective for its proposed indication, or may deem a product candidate\u2019s safety or other perceived risks to outweigh its clinical or other benefits;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including the number of subjects in the safety database, sufficient to support approval, or the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body for approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials performed by us or third parties, or with the interpretation of any partner with which we may collaborate;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission and approval of an NDA, BLA or other applicable regulatory filing;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may identify deficiencies in the formulation, manufacturing, quality control, labeling or specifications of our current or future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may require clinical trials in pediatric patients in order to establish pharmacokinetics or safety for this more drug-sensitive population;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval but impose substantial and costly post-approval requirements;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may approve our current or any future product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not approve of the manufacturing processes, controls or facilities of third-party manufacturers or testing labs with which we contract; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of drugs, including biologics, in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. For example, the FDA may not agree with our Phase 3 clinical trial protocols for our product candidates. In addition, our product candidates may not be approved by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies even though they meet specified endpoints in our clinical trials. The FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies may ask us to conduct additional costly and time-consuming clinical trials in order to obtain marketing approval or approval to enter into an advanced phase of development, or may change the requirements for approval even after such agency has reviewed and commented on the design for the clinical trials. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval for any of our product candidates would delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates and would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe have never prepared a BLA or obtained approval of a BLA or NDA submission or equivalent foreign filing, and we may be unable to successfully do so for any of our product candidates. Failure to successfully prepare or obtain approval of a BLA or NDA submission or equivalent foreign filing in a timely manner for any of our product candidates could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nPreparing and obtaining approval of a BLA or NDA submission or equivalent foreign filing are complicated processes. Although our employees have prepared BLAs, and obtained approvals of BLAs, NDAs and equivalent foreign filings in the past while employed at other companies, we as a company have not done so. As a result, such activities may require more time and cost more than we anticipate. Failure to complete or obtain, or delays in completing or obtaining, approval of our NDA and BLA submissions for glycopyrronium tosylate, olumacostat glasaretil or lebrikizumab, respectively, would prevent us from or delay us in commercializing our product candidates in the United States. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nEven if our current product candidates or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success.\nThe commercial success of any of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by physicians and patients for approved indications. Our product candidates may not be commercially successful. The degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for approved products that treat those indications;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully compete with existing therapies, some of which are widely known and accepted by physicians and patients, including demonstrating that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our product provides an attractive alternative to the existing therapies;\n\u2022\nthe availability of formulary coverage and adequate reimbursement from private third-party payers for any of our product candidates that may be approved;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment with our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for the product, if approved, on the part of patients;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nphysician and patient willingness to adopt a new therapy over other available therapies to treat approved indications;\n\u2022\nin the case of hyperhidrosis, patients\u2019 perception of the condition as one for which medical treatment may be appropriate and a prescription therapy may be available;\n\u2022\novercoming any biases physicians or patients may have toward particular therapies for the treatment of approved indications;\n\u2022\nproper training and administration of our product candidates by physicians and medical staff;\n\u2022\npatient satisfaction with the results and administration of our product candidates and overall treatment experience;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay for certain of our product candidates relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\u2022\nthe revenue and profitability that our product candidate may offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of side effects;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nany FDA requirement to undertake a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our third-party supply and manufacturing operations while increasing production capabilities for our current product candidates to commercial levels; and\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our growth and operations to effectively support our commercialization activities.\nIf any of our current or future product candidates are approved for use but fail to achieve the broad degree of physician, patient and payer adoption necessary for commercial success, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.\nOur product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing. We face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, clinical trial expertise, intellectual property portfolios, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than we do. Some of the companies that offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. In addition, certain of our product candidates, if approved, may compete with other dermatological products, including over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) treatments, for a share of some patients\u2019 discretionary budgets and for physicians\u2019 attention within their clinical practices.\nMany pharmaceutical companies currently offer products or are developing alternative product candidates and technologies, for indications similar to those targeted by our product candidates, including: AbbVie Inc., Akaal Pharma Pty Ltd., Allergan plc, Almirall, S.A., Amgen Inc., AnaptysBio, Inc., Asana BioSciences, LLC, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Bayer HealthCare AG (formerly Intendis, Inc.), BioPharmX Corporation, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Brickell Biotech, Inc., Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd., Cassiopea S.p.A., a subsidiary of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals S.A., Celgene Corporation, Dermavant Sciences Ltd., DS Biopharma Limited, Eirion Therapeutics, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Galapagos NV, Galderma S.A., GlaxoSmithKline LLC, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a division of Johnson & Johnson), Johnson & Johnson, LEO Pharma A/S, Maruho Co., Ltd., Medimetriks Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MedImmune, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Miramar Labs, Inc., Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MorphoSys AG, Mylan Inc., Novan, Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Qurient Co., Ltd., Ralexar Therapeutics, Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, a division of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sandoz International GmbH (a division of Novartis), Sanofi-Aventis GroupeS.A., Shire plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., TheraVida, Inc., Torii Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Ulthera, Inc. (a subsidiary of Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.\nThe markets for dermatological therapies are competitive and are characterized by significant technological development and new product introduction. We anticipate that, if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will face significant competition from other approved therapies. If approved, our product candidates may also compete with unregulated, unapproved and off-label treatments. Certain of our product candidates, if approved, would present novel therapeutic approaches for the approved indications and would have to compete with existing therapies, some of which are widely known and accepted by physicians and patients. To compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our approved products, if any, provide an attractive alternative to existing and other new therapies. The competition we face could lead to reduced market share for our product candidates and contribute to downward pressure on the pricing of our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nDue to less stringent regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries, there are many more dermatological products and procedures available for use in those international markets than are approved for use in the United States. In certain international markets, there are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market their products. As a result, we expect to face more competition in these markets than in the United States.\nWe expect to face generic competition for our product candidates and may face competition from biosimilars, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nUpon the expiration or loss of any patent protection for any of our product candidates that are approved, or upon the \u201cat-risk\u201d launch, despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product, by a generic competitor of a generic version of any of our product candidates that are approved, which may be sold at significantly lower prices than our approved product candidates, we could lose a significant portion of sales of that product in a short period of time, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. In particular, our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate faces competition from currently marketed generic oral and compounded topical anticholinergic agents. In addition, we may be subject to additional competition from third parties pursuing topical formulations of other anticholinergic agents for hyperhidrosis.\nWe may also face competition from biosimilars. In the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (\u201cBPCIA\u201d) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201chighly similar,\u201d or \u201cbiosimilar,\u201d to or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved biological product. This pathway allows competitors to reference the FDA\u2019s prior determinations regarding innovative biological products and to obtain approval of a biosimilar application 12 years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. The 12-year exclusivity period runs from the initial approval of the innovator product and not from approval of a new indication. In addition, the 12-year exclusivity period does not prevent another company from developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating all the data necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. Exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely on the FDA\u2019s prior determinations in approving a BLA for an innovator\u2019s biological product to support the biosimilar product\u2019s approval. Further, under the FDA\u2019s current interpretation, it is possible that a biosimilar applicant could\nobtain approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for the other indications. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAny product candidates that we commercialize, or that any partner with which we may collaborate commercializes, will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEven after we or our partners achieve U.S. regulatory approval for a product candidate, if any, we or our partners will be subject to continued regulatory review and compliance obligations. For example, with respect to our product candidates, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval. A product candidate\u2019s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials or other REMS, to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. We will also be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to, among other things, the manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our product candidates. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP requirements and with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practice (\u201cGCP\u201d) requirements and good laboratory practice (\u201cGLP\u201d) requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our product candidates in clinical development, and for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. To the extent that a product candidate is approved for sale in other countries, we may be subject to similar restrictions and requirements imposed by laws and government regulators in those countries.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug and biologic products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where, or processes by which, the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requesting that we initiate a product recall, or requiring notice to physicians, withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspend or withdraw product approvals or revoke necessary licenses;\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrequire us or our partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nissue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available;\n\u2022\ncommence criminal investigations and prosecutions;\n\u2022\nimpose injunctions, suspensions or revocations of necessary approvals or other licenses;\n\u2022\nimpose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our potential partners;\n\u2022\nrefuse to permit drugs or precursor chemicals to be imported or exported to or from the United States;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require us or our partners to initiate a product recall.\nThe regulations, policies or guidance of the FDA and other applicable government agencies may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulations that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have conducted, are conducting and may in the future conduct clinical trials for our product candidates outside the United States and the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials, which would likely result in additional costs to us and delay our business plan.\nWe have conducted, are conducting and may in the future choose to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States, including in Australia, Canada and Europe. For example, our Phase 3 clinical program for olumacostat glasaretil is being conducted in multiple countries. Although the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States or the applicable jurisdiction, acceptance of such study data by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; the studies were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and the data are considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Many foreign regulatory bodies have similar requirements. In addition, such foreign studies would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the studies are conducted. There can be no assurance the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States or the applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in post-approval regulatory action, any of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nUnforeseen side effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed. Undesirable side effects caused by product candidates could cause us, any partners with which we may collaborate or regulatory authorities to interrupt, modify, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Results of clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of one or more of these side effects. In such an event, trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us, or our potential partners, to cease further development of or deny approval of product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Any drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by our product candidates after obtaining U.S. or foreign regulatory approval or other products with the same or related active ingredients, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require a recall of the product or we or our potential partners may voluntarily recall a product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of warnings or contraindications in the product labeling, narrowing of the indication in the product label or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients or institute a REMS;\n\u2022\nwe may have limitations on how we promote the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may require additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;\n\u2022\nsales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour brand and reputation may suffer.\nAny of the above events resulting from undesirable side effects or other previously unknown problems could prevent us or our potential partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nWe may face product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, failure to follow instructions, misuse or abuse associated with our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. We cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits in the future, nor can we provide assurances that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover our liability under any such cases.\nIn addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product candidates, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ndecreased enrollment rates of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical trial programs;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or withdrawal from the market or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nsubstantial costs of any related litigation or similar disputes;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention and other resources from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants against us that may not be covered by insurance; or\n\u2022\nloss of revenue.\nLarge judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had anticipated or unanticipated side effects. Although we have obtained product liability insurance coverage for clinical trials, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. We will need to increase our product liability coverage if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, which will be costly, and we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if physicians misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, product liability claims and significant fines, penalties and sanctions, and our brand and reputation could be harmed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about drug and biologic products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling and comparative safety or efficacy claims cannot be made without direct comparative clinical data. For example, although our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate, if approved, may appeal to individuals who have not been diagnosed with hyperhidrosis, we will only be able to promote glycopyrronium tosylate for its approved indication. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses of any of our product candidates, we may receive warning or untitled letters and become subject to significant criminal and civil liability, which would materially harm our business. Both federal and state governments have levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper off-label promotion and have enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion.\nIf we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred and our brand and reputation could be damaged. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we are deemed by the FDA to have engaged in the promotion of our products for off-label uses, we could be subject to FDA regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including criminal, civil or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our product candidates outside of those indications for use when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems appropriate. Physicians may also misuse our product candidates or use improper techniques, potentially leading to adverse results, side effects or injury, which may lead to product liability claims. If our product candidates are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by physicians or their patients. Furthermore, the use of our product candidates for indications other than those approved by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation among physicians and patients.\nWe may choose not to continue developing or commercializing any of our product candidates at any time during development or after approval, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates.\nAt any time, we may decide to discontinue the development of any of our product candidates or not to continue commercializing one or more of our approved product candidates for a variety of reasons, such as the appearance of new technologies that make our product obsolete, competition from a competing product, changes in or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the discovery of unforeseen side effects after the approved product has been marketed or the occurrence of adverse events at a rate or severity level that is greater than experienced in our clinical trials. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will not receive any return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses. See also \u201c-Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in post-approval regulatory action, any of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\u201d\nWe or our current and prospective partners may be subject to product recalls in the future that could harm our brand and reputation and could negatively affect our business.\nWe or our current and prospective partners may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, fail to meet specifications or are believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations including those related to manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sale or distribution. Any recall, withdrawal or seizure in the future could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brand and lead to decreased demand for our approved products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our approved products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf the FDA concludes that our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate does not satisfy the requirements under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cSection 505(b)(2)\u201d pathway), or if the requirements for our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate under the Section 505(b)(2) pathway are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, any of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe are seeking FDA approval of our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis through the Section 505(b)(2) pathway. Glycopyrronium tosylate is a novel form of an anticholinergic agent that has been approved for systemic administration in other indications. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Section 505(b)(2) pathway permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant either does not own or has not obtained a right of reference. Reliance on certain findings made by the FDA in approving the anticholinergic agent referenced in our NDA could expedite the glycopyrronium tosylate development program by potentially decreasing the amount of non-clinical or clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval.\nGlycopyrronium tosylate differs from the approved product we referenced in chemical structure, route of administration, dosage form and indication, and if we are unable to demonstrate an acceptable clinical bridge through comparative pharmacokinetic data between glycopyrronium tosylate and the approved product, the FDA may not permit us to use the Section 505(b)(2) pathway for regulatory approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) pathway as anticipated or determines that our clinical bridge is not adequate, or if the Section 505(b)(2) pathway fails to significantly decrease the amount of testing we must conduct, we may need to conduct additional non-clinical or clinical trials, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval, which would substantially increase the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for glycopyrronium tosylate and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects may be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidate, which would likely harm our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) pathway, we cannot provide assurances that our product candidate will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nNotwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may be required to change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under the Section 505(b)(2) pathway. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months depending on the outcome of any litigation. In addition, Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to potential data or marketing exclusivity rights that reward certain research performed by the sponsors of previously approved drugs. The exercise of such exclusivity rights can delay FDA approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, or certain proposed product uses, for a period ranging from three to seven years, depending on the type of exclusivity earned. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved referenced product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval.\nOur commercial success may be severely hindered if patients do not have access to our approved products, if any, from their insurers without undue restriction.\nThe availability of formulary coverage and adequate reimbursement from private third-party payers such as pharmacy benefit managers and commercial insurers, and to a lesser degree, governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, is critical to market acceptance and commercial success of any of our product candidates, if approved, that become available only by prescription. Timely coverage and acceptable patient cost-sharing tiers for our products, if approved, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, increasing and intense pressure from political, social, competitive and other sources to reduce drug unit costs or limit changes in list price; changes in federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payers\u2019 reimbursement policies; consolidation and increasing assertiveness of commercial payers seeking net price reduction via drug rebates and other forms of discounts linked to the placement of our products, if approved, on their formularies; and the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived pharmacoeconomic value.\nA primary trend in the healthcare industry is cost containment. Third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs by, among other methods, limiting or preventing (via formulary exclusion) coverage for particular medications, requiring drug companies to provide them with varying levels of discounts from list prices and/or challenging the value of list prices charged for medical products. Coverage decisions may depend upon the size of a patient population, perceptions of clinical efficacy and economic standards that may disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available.\nAlthough private third-party payers in the United States tend to follow Medicare reimbursement policies for products which are administered in a hospital or physician office setting, no uniform policy of pharmacy benefit coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products adjudicated in a pharmacy benefit setting can differ significantly across payers. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates, if approved, to each third-party payer separately, with no assurance that coverage will be obtained.\nIn addition, the market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payers\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and impose patient out-of-pocket cost sharing limits. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other therapeutically similar alternative is available.\nThird-party payers may also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain regulatory approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering our products for those patients. If any of our product candidates do not demonstrate attractive efficacy profiles, they may not qualify for coverage and reimbursement.\nPatients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs of their prescription drugs. Even if we obtain favorable coverage for a given product, the patient may be required to pay co-payments or co-insurance they find unacceptably high. Patients may be unlikely to use our products, if approved, unless coverage is established and reimbursement for their medicine from their insurer adequately covers a significant portion of the cost of our products.\nOur inability to promptly obtain insurance coverage, profitable reimbursement rates or access to third-party payers\u2019 drug formularies from private payers and, to a smaller degree, government-funded health insurance for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and product candidates.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of any partner with which we may collaborate. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, former President Obama signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). It contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which have impacted and are expected to continue to impact existing government healthcare programs and result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, (1) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (2) established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and (3) enacted a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nThe current presidential administration and certain members of the majority of the U.S. Congress have sought to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act and implement a replacement program. For example, the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed as part of tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017, such that the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) will be eliminated beginning in 2019. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.\nWe may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nCertain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights, among other topics, are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we or our partners conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or in return for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including, for example, the federal civil False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be provided to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party suppliers and manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nThe manufacturing activities of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our suppliers\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending use and disposal. We and our suppliers and manufacturers cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, injury to our service providers and others and environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party suppliers and manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, CROs and any partners with which we may collaborate may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, CROs and any partners with which we may collaborate may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these persons could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: laws or regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities; manufacturing standards; federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commissions, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations, and serious harm to our reputation. In addition, federal procurement laws impose substantial penalties for misconduct in connection with government contracts and require certain contractors to maintain a code of business ethics and conduct. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe have in the past relied and expect to continue to rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials, other aspects of our product development and our regulatory submission process. If these third parties do not meet our requirements, conduct the trials as required or otherwise provide services as anticipated, we may not be able to satisfy our contractual obligations or obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe have in the past relied and expect to continue to rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials, other aspects of our product development and our regulatory submission process. We also rely upon various medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and all applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s regulations and GCPs, which are an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and state regulations governing the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for drug and biologic products. These CROs and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of our clinical trials, the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials and the preparation for and submission of our filings with the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. See also \u201c-We rely completely on third parties to supply, manufacture and distribute clinical drug supplies for our product candidates, including certain sole-source suppliers and manufacturers, we intend to rely on third parties for commercial supply, manufacturing and distribution if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we expect to rely on third parties for supply, manufacturing and distribution of preclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidates.\u201d\nWe rely heavily on third parties for the execution of our clinical trials and preclinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs and other third-party contractors are required to comply with GCP and GLP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP and GLP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP and GLP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or other regulatory authority may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our or our partners\u2019 marketing applications. We cannot provide assurances that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical or preclinical trials complies with applicable GCP and GLP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must generally be conducted with products produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations and policies may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of our CROs or clinical trial sites terminate their involvement in one of our clinical trials for any reason, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical trial sites in a timely manner, or do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, if our relationship with clinical trial sites is terminated, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and could receive cash compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nAdditionally, the regulatory submission process for our product candidates is complex. We expect to rely on a third-party service provider for the preparation and submission of filings with the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval of our product candidates. If our relationship with such service provider is terminated prior to completion of our regulatory submission process, we may not be able to enter into an arrangement with an alternative service provider in a timely manner, or do so on commercially reasonable terms, and our submission may be substantially delayed.\nWe rely completely on third parties to supply, manufacture and distribute clinical drug supplies for our product candidates, including certain sole-source suppliers and manufacturers, we intend to rely on third parties for commercial supply, manufacturing and distribution if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we expect to rely on third parties for supply, manufacturing and distribution of preclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidates.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to supply, manufacture or distribute preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of drug substances or products. Our ability to develop our product candidates depends, and our ability to commercially supply our products will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain the APIs and other substances and materials used in our product candidates from third parties and to have finished products manufactured by third parties in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical testing and commercialization. If we fail to develop and maintain supply relationships with these third parties, we may be unable to continue to develop or commercialize our product candidates. See also \u201c-We are dependent on Roche for the manufacture and supply of lebrikizumab drug substance. If Roche elects to transfer its manufacture and supply responsibilities to us, we may not be able to engage a qualified contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply the drug substance in a timely manner, if at all. Any interruption in our supply may cause serious delays in the timing of our clinical studies, increase our costs and adversely impact our financial results.\u201d)\nWe rely and will continue to rely on certain third parties as the sole source of the materials they supply or the finished products they manufacture. The drug substances and other materials used in our product candidates are currently available only from one domestic or foreign supplier and foreign manufacturer and certain of our finished product candidates are manufactured by one or a limited number of contract manufacturers. For example, we are dependent on our current suppliers of the nonwoven material and pouchstock in our glycopyrronium tosylate finished product. Any of our existing suppliers or manufacturers may:\n\u2022\nfail to supply us with product on a timely basis or in the requested amount due to unexpected damage to or destruction of facilities or equipment or otherwise;\n\u2022\nfail to increase manufacturing capacity and produce drug product and components in larger quantities and at higher yields in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, to sufficiently meet our commercial needs;\n\u2022\nbe unable to meet our production demands due to issues related to their reliance on sole-source suppliers and manufacturers;\n\u2022\nsupply us with product that fails to meet regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nbecome unavailable through business interruption or financial insolvency;\n\u2022\nlose regulatory status as an approved source;\n\u2022\nbe unable or unwilling to renew current supply agreements when such agreements expire on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all; or\n\u2022\ndiscontinue production or manufacturing of necessary drug substances or products.\nIn the event of any of the foregoing, if we do not have an alternative supplier or manufacturer in place, we would be required to expend substantial management time and expense to identify, qualify and transfer processes to alternative suppliers or manufacturers. Transferring technology to other sites may require additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which are costly, may take considerable amounts of time, may not be successful and, in some cases, require review and approval by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Any need to find and qualify new suppliers or manufacturers could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely, adversely impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of or market our product candidates, if approved, and adversely affect our business. There can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, we and our manufacturers do not currently maintain significant inventory of drug substances and other materials. Any interruption in the supply of a drug substance or other material or in the manufacture of a finished product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe expect to continue to depend on third-party contract suppliers and manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Our supply and manufacturing agreements, if any, do not guarantee that a contract supplier or manufacturer will provide services adequate for our needs. We and our contract suppliers and manufacturers continue to improve production processes, certain aspects of which are complex and unique, and we may encounter difficulties with new or existing processes. While we attempt to build in certain contractual obligations on such third-party suppliers and manufacturers, we may not be able to ensure that such third parties comply with these obligations. Depending on the extent of any difficulties encountered, we could experience an interruption in clinical or commercial supply, with the result that the development, regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or interrupted. Third-party suppliers and manufacturers may have the ability to increase the price payable by us for the supply of the APIs and other substances and materials used in our product candidates, in some cases without our consent. In addition, our reliance on contract manufacturers and suppliers further exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nTo date, some of our drug substances and product candidates have been manufactured in relatively small quantities for clinical trials. As we prepare for potential commercialization, we have completed the scale-up of production of some of our drug substances and product candidates, but may consider further scale-up and transferring production to new third-party suppliers or manufacturers. If any of our product candidates is approved for sale, our contract manufacturers and suppliers will need to produce the resulting drug product and its components reliably in large quantities, cost effectively and, in certain cases, at higher yields than they currently achieve. These third-party contractors may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any products in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during those scale-up activities because of the inherent properties of a product candidate itself or of a product candidate in combination with other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process, or during shipping and storage of the drug substance or the finished product. If our third-party contractors are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of any of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers or manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality or we are unable to successfully transfer the processes on a timely basis, the commercial launch for any resulting products may be delayed, or there may be a shortage in supply, either of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe do not have direct control over the ability of our contract suppliers and manufacturers to maintain adequate capacity and capabilities to serve our needs, including quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as cGMPs, we are dependent on our contract suppliers and manufacturers for day-to-day compliance with cGMPs for production of both APIs and finished products. Facilities used by our contract suppliers and manufacturers to produce the drug substances and materials or finished products for commercial sale must pass inspection and be approved by the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities. Our contract suppliers and manufacturers must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and review of submitted technical information. If the safety of any product or product candidate is compromised due to a failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to successfully commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for the affected product or product candidate, and we may be held liable for injuries sustained as a result. In addition, the manufacturing facilities of certain of our suppliers are located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing our products or product candidates or their components into the United States or other countries as a result of, among other things, regulatory agency approval requirements, taxes, tariffs, local import requirements such as import duties or inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging. Any of these factors could cause a delay or termination of preclinical studies, clinical trials or regulatory submissions or approvals of our product candidates, and could entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our approved products on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe are dependent on Roche for the manufacture and supply of lebrikizumab drug substance. If Roche elects to transfer its manufacture and supply responsibilities to us, we may not be able to engage a qualified contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply the drug substance in a timely manner, if at all. Any interruption in our supply may cause serious delays in the timing of our clinical studies, increase our costs and adversely impact our financial results.\nPursuant to the terms of our license agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, \u201cRoche\u201d) for the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for, among other indications, atopic dermatitis (the \u201cRoche Agreement\u201d), Roche is responsible for the manufacture and supply to us of lebrikizumab drug substance and we are completely reliant upon Roche to provide us with adequate supply for our use. We may experience an interruption in supply if, among other reasons, we incorrectly forecast our supply requirements, Roche allocates supply to its own development programs, Roche incorrectly plans its manufacturing production or Roche is unable to manufacture lebrikizumab drug substance in a timely manner to match our development or commercial needs.\nAdditionally, the Roche Agreement provides that, subject to certain requirements, Roche has the right to transfer its drug substance manufacture and supply responsibilities to us at any time. We do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to supply, manufacture or distribute clinical or commercial quantities of lebrikizumab drug substances. If Roche elects to transfer its manufacture and supply responsibilities to us, we will incur added costs in qualifying a contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply the drug substance and there can be no assurance that a qualified contract manufacturer would be available to us on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we experience any interruption in the supply of lebrikizumab drug substance, our ability to timely supply our clinical sites would be adversely impacted, causing potentially serious delays in the timing of our clinical studies and substantially increased costs if studies need to be adjusted or re-performed. See also \u201c-We rely completely on third parties to supply, manufacture and distribute clinical drug supplies for our product candidates, including certain sole-source suppliers and manufacturers, we intend to rely on third parties for commercial supply, manufacturing and distribution if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we expect to rely on third parties for supply, manufacturing and distribution of preclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidates.\u201d\nManufacturing and supply of the APIs and other substances and materials used in our product candidates and finished drug products is a complex and technically challenging undertaking, and there is potential for failure at many points in the manufacturing, testing, quality assurance and distribution supply chain, as well as the potential for latent defects after products have been manufactured and distributed.\nManufacturing and supply of APIs, other substances and materials and finished drug products is technically challenging. Changes beyond our direct control can impact the quality, volume, price and successful delivery of our product candidates and can impede, delay, limit or prevent the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. Mistakes and mishandling are not uncommon and can affect successful production and supply. Some of these risks include:\n\u2022\nfailure of our manufacturers to follow cGMP requirements or mishandling of product while in production or in preparation for transit;\n\u2022\ninability of our contract suppliers and manufacturers to efficiently and cost-effectively increase and maintain high yields and batch quality, consistency and stability;\n\u2022\ninability of our suppliers and manufacturers to meet our production demands due to issues related to their reliance on sole-source suppliers and manufacturers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing optimal production, storage, packaging and shipment methods and processes;\n\u2022\nchallenges in designing effective drug delivery substances and techniques;\n\u2022\ntransportation and import/export risk, particularly given the global nature of our supply chain;\n\u2022\ndelays in analytical results or failure of analytical techniques that we depend on for quality control and release of product;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, labor disputes, financial distress, lack of raw material supply, issues with facilities and equipment or other forms of disruption to the business operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers; and\n\u2022\nlatent defects that may become apparent after product has been released and which may result in recall and destruction of product.\nAny of these factors could result in delays or higher costs in connection with our clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our products, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are not able to establish and maintain collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nThe development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. In order to fund further development of our product candidates, we may collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and experience, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials; the likelihood of approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; the potential market for the subject product candidate; the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients; the potential of competing products; any uncertainty with respect to our ownership of our intellectual property; and industry and market conditions generally. The partner may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential partners. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future partners.\nCollaborations typically impose detailed obligations on each party, such as those required under the Roche Agreement. If we were to breach our obligations, we may face substantial consequences, including potential termination of the collaboration, and our rights to product candidates, in which we have invested substantial time and money, would be lost.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements for the development of our product candidates. When we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish to the third party some of the control over the future success of that product candidate. Our collaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may be unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing preclinical and initial clinical development of a partnered product candidate or research program, and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nOur plans for the development and commercialization of lebrikizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may be adversely impacted by Roche\u2019s decisions and actions regarding product development, regulatory strategy and commercialization of lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases (the \u201cRetained Field\u201d).\nPursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement, we obtained the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab in the Retained Field, and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Roche\u2019s rights in the Retained Field will be relinquished to us (the \u201cRoche Reversion\u201d): (a) at Roche\u2019s election at any time following 30 days\u2019 prior written notice to us; or (b) automatically if at any time in a period of 18 consecutive months Roche is not conducting an active clinical study of lebrikizumab or recurring, bona fide activities aimed at receiving regulatory approval for the compound in the Retained Field, provided that such automatic reversion may not occur within three years of the effective date of the Roche Agreement or following regulatory approval for the compound in the Retained Field. Until the occurrence of the Roche Reversion, if at all, Roche has the sole right to develop lebrikizumab in the Retained Field and, if regulatory approval is obtained, will be responsible for promotion, market access, reimbursement, funding and listing activities relating to lebrikizumab in the Retained Field. In exercising its rights in the Retained Field, Roche may make decisions and take actions with respect to the development and promotion of lebrikizumab which may not align with and may adversely impact our efforts for the development and commercialization lebrikizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. See also \u201c-If any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if physicians misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, product liability claims and significant fines, penalties and sanctions, and our brand and reputation could be harmed.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Operations\nWe need to further increase the size and complexity of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing any growth.\nOur management, personnel, systems and facilities currently in place are not adequate to support our business plan and future growth. As of December 31, 2017, we had 162 full-time employees. We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations as we prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will need to further expand our scientific, medical affairs, sales and marketing, managerial, operational, financial and other resources to support our planned research, development and commercialization activities.\nOur need to manage our operations, growth and various projects effectively requires that we:\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nidentify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional talented employees;\n\u2022\ndevelop a marketing, sales and distribution capability;\n\u2022\nmanage our commercialization activities for our product candidates effectively and in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain relationships with development and commercialization partners;\n\u2022\nmanage our preclinical and clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nmanage our third-party supply and manufacturing operations effectively and in a cost-effective manner, while increasing production capabilities for our current product candidates to commercial levels;\n\u2022\nexpand our facilities; and\n\u2022\nmanage our development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to partners and other third parties.\nIn addition, historically, we have utilized and continue to utilize the services of part-time outside consultants to perform a number of tasks for us, including tasks related to preclinical and clinical testing. Our growth strategy may also entail expanding our use of consultants to implement these and other tasks going forward. We rely on consultants for certain functions of our business and will need to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside consultants, as needed, on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nTo effectively manage our growth and expand our organization, we may incur significant costs and our management and business development resources may be diverted. If we are unable to successfully implement the tasks necessary to effectively execute our growth strategy and manage our growth, our ability to achieve our research, development and commercialization goals may be materially adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to attract and retain management and other key personnel, we may be unable to continue to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical, sales and marketing and other personnel. We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including: our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, Thomas G. Wiggans; our Chief Medical Officer and a member of our board of directors, Eugene A. Bauer, M.D.; our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew L. Guggenhime; our Chief Development Officer, Luis C. Pe\u00f1a; our Chief Commercial Officer, Lori Lyons-Williams; and our Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy, Christopher M. Griffith. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could impede, delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials, commercialization of our product candidates or in-licensing or acquisition of new assets and could negatively impact our ability to successfully implement our business plan. If we lose the services of any of these individuals, we might not be able to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or at all, and our business could be harmed as a result. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. We employ all of our executive officers and key personnel on an at-will basis and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason and without notice. In order to retain valuable employees at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we provide stock options and restricted stock units that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options and restricted stock units that vest over time will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract offers from other companies.\nWe might not be able to attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are headquartered. We could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will harm our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve our business objectives.\nIn addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.\nWe currently have no sales representatives and limited marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or through third parties, we will be unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nAlthough our employees have experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products from prior employment at other companies, we as a company have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success, we must continue to effectively build our commercial infrastructure, including our marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities, as well as substantially expand our organization cross-functionally to enable us to execute on our commercialization goals. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products through our own sales organization include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future drugs;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022\ninability to ensure adequate access to our products via agreements with payers.\nThere are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay a product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred significant commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. See also -\u201cWe need to further increase the size and complexity of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing any growth.\u201d\nWe may also choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if we are able to enter into such arrangements, we will likely have little control over these third parties, and any such third party may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.\nAny failure or delay in the development of our commercial infrastructure and sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our product candidates. The inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur failure to successfully in-license, acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow our business.\nWe intend to in-license, acquire, develop and market additional products and product candidates. Because our internal research and development capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify and select promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products, negotiate licensing or acquisition agreements with their current owners and finance these arrangements.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales and other resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nFurther, any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical or clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any approved products that we acquire will be manufactured or sold profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nWe intend to in-license and acquire product candidates or engage in other strategic transactions, which could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nOur strategy is to in-license and acquire product candidates or engage in other strategic transactions. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions entail numerous potential operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsubstantial acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of assets or impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers, partners or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022\ninability to retain our key employees or those of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, and any transaction that we do complete could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. We have no current plan, commitment or obligation to enter into any transaction described above.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations, adversely impacting our stock price.\nOur operations to date have been primarily limited to researching and developing our product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or approved products on the market. From time to time, we may enter into collaboration agreements and license agreements with other companies that include development funding and significant upfront and milestone expenditures and payments, and we expect that amounts earned from or paid pursuant to these agreements will be a significant source of our capital expenditures and an important source of our revenue. Accordingly, our revenue and profitability will depend on the achievement of milestones under a license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. pursuant to which we granted Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan, as well as any potential future collaboration and license agreements and sales of our products, if approved. These upfront and milestone payments may vary significantly from period to period and any such variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results from one period to the next. In addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the award, based on the fair value of the award as determined by our board of directors, and recognize the cost as an expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards change over time, including our underlying stock price and stock price volatility, the magnitude of the expense that we must recognize may vary significantly. Furthermore, our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays in the commencement, patient enrollment and the timing of clinical testing for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success or failure of clinical trials for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\n\u2022\nany delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to our product candidates, which may change from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates, which may vary depending on FDA guidelines and requirements, and the quantity of production;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional funding to develop our product candidates;\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our product candidates, should they receive approval, which may vary significantly;\n\u2022\npotential side effects of our product candidates that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;\n\u2022\nthe availability of formulary coverage and adequate reimbursement from private third-party payers for any of our product candidates that may be approved;\n\u2022\nour dependency on third-party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish an effective sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, and our ability to forecast demand for those product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to receive regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;\n\u2022\nour ability and third parties\u2019 abilities to protect intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncosts related to and outcomes of potential litigation or other disputes;\n\u2022\nour ability to adequately support future growth;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively;\n\u2022\npotential liabilities associated with hazardous materials;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain adequate insurance policies; and\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.\nOur operating results and liquidity needs could be negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn.\nOur operating results and liquidity could be negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. The market for discretionary medical products and procedures may be particularly vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions. Some patients may consider certain of our product candidates to be discretionary, and if full reimbursement for such products is not available, demand for these products may be tied to the discretionary spending levels of our targeted patient populations. Domestic and international equity and debt markets have experienced and may continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns. In the event these economic conditions and concerns continue or worsen and the markets continue to remain volatile, our operating results and liquidity could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including weakening demand for certain of our approved products, if any, and making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline. Additionally, although we plan to market our products primarily in the United States, our partners have extensive global operations, indirectly exposing us to additional risk.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and research and development income tax credit carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had NOL carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for federal, California and Canadian income tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal and California NOL carryforwards will begin expiring during the year ending December 31, 2030 and the Canadian NOL carryforwards will begin expiring during the year ending December 31, 2028. Under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have experienced at least one ownership change since inception and our utilization of NOL carryforwards will therefore be subject to annual limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California, near major earthquake and fire zones. If a disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as enterprise financial systems, manufacturing resource planning or enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Our contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 facilities are located in multiple locations, where other natural disasters or similar events, such as blizzards, tornadoes, fires, explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. In addition, acts of terrorism and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners, manufacturers or the economy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our partners\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays in the regulatory approval, manufacture, distribution or commercialization of our product candidates, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would suffer.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of failure, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of our or our partners\u2019 critical information technology systems or infrastructure.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. We could also experience a business interruption, intentional theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our manufacturing activities, development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of manufacturing records or clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further commercialization and development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to obtain or enforce patent rights or other intellectual property rights that cover our product candidates and technologies that are of sufficient breadth to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success with respect to our product candidates and technologies will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in both the United States and other countries, to preserve our trade secrets and to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our ability to protect any of our product candidates from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents.\nOur patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we believe there is a market opportunity for our products. The covered technology and the scope of coverage vary from country to country. For those countries where we do not have granted patents, we may not have any ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our technologies. Any patents that we may obtain may be narrow in scope and thus easily circumvented by competitors. Further, in countries where we do not have granted patents, third parties may be able to make, use or sell products identical to or substantially similar to, our product candidates.\nThe patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors and licensees may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our current licensors or licensees, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If our current licensors or licensees, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDue to legal standards relating to patentability, validity, enforceability and claim scope of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, rights under any existing patents or any patents we might obtain or license may not cover our product candidates, or may not provide us with sufficient protection for our product candidates to afford a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes, including those from branded and generic pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Even if patents have issued or will issue, we cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are or will be held valid or enforceable if challenged in post-grant proceedings or by the courts or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us.\nCompetitors in the field of dermatologic therapeutics have created a substantial amount of prior art, including scientific publications, patents and patent applications. Our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Although we believe that our technology includes certain inventions that are unique and not duplicative of any prior art, we do not have outstanding issued patents covering all of the recent developments in our technology and we are unsure of the patent protection that we will be successful in obtaining, if any. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may design around or challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents we own or license, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. In particular, due to the extensive prior art relating to anticholinergic agents to control hyperhidrosis and because glycopyrronium tosylate is a form of a generic anticholinergic agent, the patent protection available for glycopyrronium tosylate may not prevent competitors from developing and commercializing similar products. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is challenged, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, or threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates.\nThe laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not provide intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nThe degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain. Patent protection may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to invent or the first to file the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nany patents we obtain or our licensors\u2019 issued patents may not encompass commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nany patents we obtain or our in-licensed issued patents may not be valid or enforceable; and\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable or provide us with a competitive advantage.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of our product candidates. Further, the extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate limits the time during which we can market a product candidate under patent protection, which may particularly affect the profitability of our early-stage product candidates. The issued U.S. patents relating to olumacostat glasaretil, glycopyrronium tosylate and lebrikizumab will expire between 2020 and 2037.\nProprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and intellectual property protection agreements with certain employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or we may be unable to protect our rights. We also have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our suppliers, manufacturers and other third parties. There can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and unpatented know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. If trade secrets are independently discovered, we would not be able to prevent their use. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or unpatented know-how is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secret information.\nChanges in patent laws or the interpretations of patent laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. The United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the scope and value of patents, once obtained.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a priority claim after March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, also known as the America Invents Act (\u201cAIA\u201d) was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to our patents to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Finally, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property license agreements, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to certain license agreements that impose various diligence, milestone, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the respective licensors may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we may not be able to develop or market the affected product candidate. The loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. For example, any dispute with Roche relating to compliance with the terms of the Roche Agreement could lead to delays in, or termination of, the development and commercialization of lebrikizumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and time consuming and expensive arbitration.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot provide assurances that marketing and selling such candidates and using such technologies will not infringe existing or future patents. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields relating to our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert that our product candidates, technologies or methods of delivery or use infringe their patent rights. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various drugs, biologics, drug delivery systems or their methods of use, and which of these patents may be valid and enforceable. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods.\nIn addition, there may be issued patents of third parties that are infringed or are alleged to be infringed by our product candidates or proprietary technologies. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our own and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our product candidates or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our own and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate, in the United States, in an interference proceeding to determine priority of invention.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe such third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, including litigation resulting from filing under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act. These lawsuits could claim that there are existing patent rights for such drug and this type of litigation can be costly and could adversely affect our operating results and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel, even if we do not infringe such patents or the patents asserted against us are ultimately established as invalid. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. To date, no litigation asserting infringement claims has ever been brought against us. If a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product or technology at issue infringes or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product or using the technology at issue unless the third party licenses its intellectual property rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products or technologies; and\n\u2022\nredesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could harm our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nBecause we rely on certain third-party licensors, licensees and partners, and will continue to do so in the future, if one of our licensors, licensees or partners is sued for infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could suffer in the same manner as if we were sued directly. In addition to facing litigation risks, we have agreed to indemnify certain third-party licensors, licensees and partners against claims of infringement caused by our proprietary technologies, and we have entered or may enter into cost-sharing agreements with some our licensors, licensees and partners that could require us to pay some of the costs of patent litigation brought against those third parties whether or not the alleged infringement is caused by our proprietary technologies. In certain instances, these cost-sharing agreements could also require us to assume greater responsibility for infringement damages than would be assumed just on the basis of our technology.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other adverse proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property, including our patents or the patents of our licensors. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction against an infringer are not satisfied. An adverse determination of any litigation or other proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or amended such that they do not cover our product candidates. Moreover, such adverse determinations could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, or issuing with limited and potentially inadequate scope to cover our product candidates or to prevent others from marketing similar products.\nInterference, derivation or other proceedings such as inter partes review, post-grant review and reexamination brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors or potential partners. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able, alone or with our licensors or potential partners, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or other proceedings. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation or proceedings, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers or their former or current customers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, certain of our employees were formerly employed by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Moreover, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees and consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Although we have no knowledge of any such claims being alleged to date, if such claims were to arise, litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, any such litigation could be protracted, expensive, a distraction to our management team, not viewed favorably by investors and other third parties and may potentially result in an unfavorable outcome.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and may decline and stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased the shares.\nPrior to our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in October 2014, there had not been a public market for our common stock. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe development status of our product candidates, including whether any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe clinical results of our competitors or potential competitors;\n\u2022\nthe success of, and fluctuations in, the commercial sales of products approved for commercialization, if any;\n\u2022\nthe execution of our partnering and manufacturing arrangements;\n\u2022\nour execution of collaboration, co-promotion, licensing or other arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our preclinical and clinical development programs, including relating to the timing of invoices from, and other billing practices of, our CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our commercialization activities, if any product candidates are approved;\n\u2022\nthe performance of third parties on whom we rely for clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, including their ability to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other pharmaceutical companies;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and announcements relating to acquisitions, strategic transactions, licenses, joint ventures, capital commitments, intellectual property, litigation or other disputes impacting us or our business;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nFDA or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nchanges to laws affecting our industry, including full or partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe size of our market float;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nfuture sales and purchases of any shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (\u201cNotes\u201d);\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed herein.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular The NASDAQ Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many pharmaceutical companies. Stock prices of many pharmaceutical companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nDuring the period between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the closing sale price of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $18.67 to $38.03 per share. Because our stock price has been volatile, investing in our common stock is risky.\nIf a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock, impede our ability to raise future capital and holders may have difficulty selling their shares based on current trading volumes of our stock.\nOur stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other exchange in the future. The trading volume of our stock tends to be low and we have several stockholders who hold a significant number of shares. If there is no active trading market or if the volume of trading is limited, holders of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 41,797,561 shares of common stock outstanding, and stockholders holding 5% or more of our stock, individually or with affiliated persons or entities, collectively beneficially owned or controlled approximately 48% of such shares. If stockholders holding a significant number of our shares sell, indicate an intention to sell, or if it is perceived that they will sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline and our ability to raise future capital may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we completed a sale of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes in May 2017 in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act. The Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Notes were convertible into 8,109,771 shares of our common stock. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress our stock price.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us, among other things, to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act annually.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting and professional services fees related costs and in providing diligent management oversight.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Moreover, our independent registered public accounting firm could issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Ineffective internal control could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, any future testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements, which could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nRisks associated with use of our company-wide enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nWe completed implementation of a company-wide ERP system in 2016 to handle the business and financial processes within our operations and corporate functions. To reap the benefits of our ERP system, we were required to change certain business and financial processes. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems with the ERP system, or if the ERP system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect. If the ERP system does not operate as intended, our business, results of operations and internal controls over financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Prior to our IPO in October 2014, there had not been a public market for our common stock and we did not have research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nIf we sell or issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in the future, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be diluted.\nOn November 2, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the potential offering, issuance and sale by us of up to $300.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, and units consisting of all or some of these securities. Our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 24, 2015. In June 2016, we sold 5,175,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement for aggregate gross proceeds of $144.9 million. Furthermore, pursuant to a sales agreement between us and Cowen and Company, LLC (\u201cCowen\u201d), common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million may be issued and sold pursuant to an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering for sales of our common stock. Subject to certain limitations in the sales agreement and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver a sales notice to Cowen at any time throughout the term of the sales agreement, which has a term equal to the term of the registration statement on Form S-3 unless otherwise terminated earlier by us or Cowen pursuant to the terms of the sales agreement. The number of shares that are sold by Cowen after delivering a sales notice will fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock during the sales period and limits we set with Cowen. Because the price per share of each share sold will fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock during the sales period, it is not possible at this stage to predict the number of shares that will be ultimately issued. As of the date hereof, no shares of our common stock have been sold pursuant to the sales agreement.\nIn addition, in February 2017, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which immediately became effective. In March 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the automatic shelf registration statement for aggregate gross proceeds of $193.8 million. As long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d under SEC rules, and subject to certain other requirements, we will be eligible to file automatic shelf registration statements that become immediately effective upon filing and allow us to issue registered shares of common stock and other securities in one or more offerings, in amounts, at prices and on the terms that we will determine at the time of the offering. If we sell additional common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in future transactions pursuant to our shelf registration statements or otherwise, existing investors may be materially diluted by such subsequent sales and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nFurthermore, we completed a sale of the Notes in May 2017 in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Notes were convertible into 8,109,771 shares of our common stock. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The conversion of some or all of the Notes into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, will be able to exert significant influence over us and could impede a change of corporate control.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned (determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC), in the aggregate, approximately 15% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to exert significant influence on matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to significantly influence the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership could harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms, with directors removable from office only for cause, so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nonly our board of directors has the right to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nonly our chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\n\u2022\nour restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nall stockholder actions must be taken at meetings of our stockholders, and may not be taken by written consent;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for elections to our board of directors or to bring matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing so as to cause us to take certain corporate actions they desire.\nBecause management has broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from our previous and future sales of securities, stockholders may not agree with how we use them, and such proceeds may not be applied successfully.\nOur management will have considerable discretion over the use of proceeds from our previous and future sales of securities and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not necessarily improve our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock, or with which our stockholders otherwise disagree. The failure of our management to apply these funds effectively could, among other things, result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects, each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from our previous and future sales of securities in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nRisks Related to the Notes\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to respond to changes in our business.\nIn May 2017, we completed an offering of the Notes in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (the \u201cNotes Offering\u201d). The Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Notes were convertible into 8,109,771 shares of our common stock. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The conversion of some or all of the Notes into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. In addition, the indenture for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under the indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to maturity date for the Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.\nAs a result of our level of increased debt after the completion of the Notes Offering:\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and competitive pressures is heightened;\n\u2022\nwe are required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be more limited; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired.\nWe cannot be sure that our leverage resulting from the level of increased debt due to the Notes Offering will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when required or, if available, will be on terms satisfactory to us. Further, even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use such proceeds to repay a portion of our debt.\nWe may be unable to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required by the holders or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts due under the Notes upon an event of default, and our future debt agreements may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion, repurchase or repayment of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, the indenture for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under the indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to the maturity date for the Notes. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase Notes surrendered upon a fundamental change or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts.\nIn addition, our ability to purchase the Notes or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the Notes upon an event of default or redeem the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture (whether upon a fundamental change or otherwise under the indenture) would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any of our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness or repurchase the Notes.\nServicing debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that we will have in the future a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes.\nIf we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our schedule debt servicing obligations. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on our before maturity, and our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could result in a default on the Notes or future indebtedness.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt, repurchasing our stock, pledging our assets, making investments, paying dividends, guaranteeing debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.\nConversion of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress our stock price.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress our stock price.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to respond to changes in our business.\nAs a result of our level of debt following the completion of our sale of the Notes:\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and competitive pressures will be heightened;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to dedicate a larger portion of our capital resources to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be more limited; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired.\nWe cannot be sure that our leverage resulting from the level of debt after the completion of our sale of the Notes will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when required or, if available, will be on terms satisfactory to us. Further, even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use such proceeds to repay a portion of our debt.\nThe Notes are effectively junior to any secured debt we may incur and structurally subordinated to any liabilities of our subsidiary.\nThe Notes are our unsecured obligations exclusively and are not guaranteed by our subsidiary. Our subsidiary is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make payments on the Notes or to make any funds available for that purpose. In addition, the indenture for the Notes will not restrict us or our subsidiary from incurring additional debt or other liabilities. Accordingly, the Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; will rank equally in right of payment with any of our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; will be effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness we may incur to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and will be structurally junior to any indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure any of our debt will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after such secured debt we may incur has been repaid in full. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding.\nOur right to receive assets from our subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization, and the right of holders of the Notes to participate in those assets, is structurally subordinated to claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors. Even if we were a creditor of our subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of the subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us. Furthermore, our subsidiary is not under any obligation to make payments to us, and any payments to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of our subsidiary and various business considerations. Statutory, contractual or other restrictions may also limit our subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to us. For these reasons, we may not have access to any assets or cash flows of our subsidiary to make payments on the Notes.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Notes require us to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change. Under certain circumstances, a takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions of the indenture may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the Notes.", "PERMNO": 15003, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "DERM"}
