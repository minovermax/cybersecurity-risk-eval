{"cik": "36270", "company": "M&T BANK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nM&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments and M&T\u2019s common stock. The Company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company.\nMarket Risk\nWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.\nPoor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business including:\n\u2022\nA decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.\n\u2022\nA decrease in net interest income derived from the Company\u2019s lending and deposit gathering activities.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the value of the Company\u2019s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate.\n\u2022\nOther-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio or other investments.\n\u2022\nA decrease in fees from the Company\u2019s brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices.\n\u2022\nPotential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels.\n\u2022\nAn impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.\n\u2022\nAn increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.\nAs a result of the high percentage of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business and profitability and the value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. For example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may:\n\u2022\nAffect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the\ninterest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company\u2019s overall net interest income and profitability.\n\u2022\nAdversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the Company\u2019s loss rates on those assets.\n\u2022\nDecrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits.\n\u2022\nAffect the Company\u2019s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.\n\u2022\nAffect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company\u2019s cost of such funding.\nIn addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management\u2019s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company\u2019s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe forecasted discontinuation of LIBOR and the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the Company\u2019s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent panel banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR, such that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether and for how long LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what new or existing benchmark rate or rates may become accepted\nalternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in industry views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nRegulators and various financial industry groups have sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish consultations on recommended practices for transitioning away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based repurchase transactions. At this time, it is still not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in the market, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to the Company\u2019s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company\u2019s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2021) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.\nThe Company established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program in 2019. An impact assessment has been completed to identify on- and off-balance sheet exposures, systems, processes, models, customers, and employees affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products associated with LIBOR to alternative reference rates.\nThe Company\u2019s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.\nAs most of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company\u2019s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may:\n\u2022\nAffect the value or liquidity of the Company\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.\n\u2022\nAffect the value of capitalized servicing assets.\n\u2022\nAffect M&T\u2019s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\n\u2022\nAffect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company\u2019s services.\n\u2022\nImpact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.\nVolatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.\nThe Company\u2019s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company\u2019s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.\nRisks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory Environment\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company\u2019s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company\u2019s activities.\nAny new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Company\u2019s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent months. These and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. For more information on the regulations to which the Company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1 - Business in this report.\nM&T may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.\nBank holding companies, including M&T, are subject to capital and liquidity standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules. For additional information, see \u201cCapital Requirements\u201d under Part I, Item 1 - Business.\nFrom time to time, regulators may implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. In addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve\u2019s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the Company\u2019s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective.\nEGRRCPA, the Tailoring Rules and other recent rulemaking have in some cases reduced the capital or liquidity requirements applicable to M&T (e.g., the Company is no longer subject to any LCR requirement, and the same is expected to be true for any finalized NSFR). However, Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on the Company will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as M&T.\nM&T\u2019s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the Federal Reserve.\nAny decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T\u2019s Board of Directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby M&T\u2019s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. Prior to the public disclosure of a BHC\u2019s CCAR results, the Federal Reserve will provide the BHC with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the BHC to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. The Federal Reserve may object to any capital plan in which a BHC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements\nthroughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. If the Federal Reserve objects to M&T\u2019s capital plan, it could impose restrictions on M&T\u2019s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T. M&T cannot be certain that the Federal Reserve will not object to future capital plans.\nIn addition, Federal Reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a BHC\u2019s ability to make quarterly capital distributions - dividends and common stock share repurchases - if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the BHC had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. As such, M&T\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&T\u2019s control.\nIf an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (\u201cOLF\u201d).\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC\u2019s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit Risk\nDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.\nAs a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.\nFactors that influence the Company\u2019s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company\u2019s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company\u2019s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company\u2019s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.\nCommercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management\u2019s judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management\u2019s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2019 appropriately reflects incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover such credit losses.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.\nThe Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company\u2019s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the\nCompany\u2019s ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company\u2019s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T\u2019s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.\nIf the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company\u2019s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nM&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.\nM&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are M&T\u2019s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T\u2019s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See Item 1 - Business, Distributions\u201d for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors. Limitations on M&T\u2019s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.\nStrategic Risk\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nThe financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company\u2019s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company\u2019s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic\ndiversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits.\nFinally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC\u2019s fintech charter. As a result, the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers.\nDifficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.\nM&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nInability to fully achieve the Company\u2019s strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition.\n\u2022\nIssues arising during transition and integration.\n\u2022\nDisruption of the Company\u2019s business and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention.\n\u2022\nExposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions.\n\u2022\nLoss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions.\n\u2022\nDilution in the ownership percentage of holders of M&T common stock.\n\u2022\nPayment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company\u2019s tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term.\n\u2022\nInability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity).\n\u2022\nChanges in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities.\nOperational Risk\nThe Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.\nLike all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company\u2019s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or foregone business opportunities.\nM&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nM&T\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company\u2019s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company\u2019s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s customer relationships. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.\nInformation security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.\nFurther, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company\u2019s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company\u2019s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Company\u2019s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company\u2019s operational costs and adversely affecting its business.\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company\u2019s systems or those of third-party service providers (or, in turn, providers to such third-party providers), particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.\nThe Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the cybersecurity regulation of the NYSDFS, are implemented, the time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. In addition, the Company is increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations.\nM&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher\nvolumes of use could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company\u2019s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.\nAdditionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the Company. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors\u2019 use of common service providers.\nThe Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nMany aspects of the Company\u2019s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries\u2019 business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company\u2019s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness Risk\nChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting\nstandards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. For example, Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, became effective January 1, 2020, and substantially changes the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets. The adoption of the standard has resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $132 million. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company\u2019s prior period financial statements. Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T\u2019s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company\u2019s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company\u2019s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d and Note 1, \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies,\u201d of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nThe Company\u2019s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.\nThe Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models present the risk that the Company\u2019s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the Company may not adequately prepare for future\nevents and may suffer losses due to these failures. Also, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading. Decisions that regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to stockholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nThe Company is exposed to reputational risk.\nA negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company\u2019s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company\u2019s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the Company\u2019s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. In particular, a cyber security event impacting the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 data could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cyber security. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.\nAdditionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nDiscussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness,\u201d and Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.\nIn addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.", "PERMNO": 35554, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MTB"}
