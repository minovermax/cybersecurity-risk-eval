Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report (amounts in thousands, except share data).\nWe have been notified by NASDAQ that our stock may be delisted because we have failed to comply with the continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ. If we are unable to regain compliance, our stock will be delisted. As a result, liquidity in our stock could be impaired, and our stock price will likely decline.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol FNCX. NASDAQ informed us that we failed to comply with of NASDAQ's continuing listing criteria for equity and minimum bid price. We appealed the decision, and NASDAQ granted us an extension until August 22, 2016 to regain compliance with its continuing listing criteria. On August 22, 2016, we were advised by NASDAQ that we had satisfied the equity requirement and remain listed, subject to meeting the minimum price requirement of $1 for 10 trading days before October 1, 2016. As a result of our Reverse Stock Split on September 16, 2016 and the trading on such date and thereafter, we believe we have met that requirement timely but are awaiting NASDAQ confirmation.\nIn addition, we received a letter from NASDAQ that due to the resignation of Birame Sock as a director, we are no longer in compliance with NASDAQ rules relating to independent directors. We have six months to appoint another independent director in order to regain compliance.\nDelisting will impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which may be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of shares of our common stock. We believe that current and prospective investors will view an investment in our common stock less favorably after it is delisted from NASDAQ. This failure to meet the continuing NASDAQ listing requirements will likely have an adverse impact on the value of and trading activity in our common stock.\nThe sale of our Viggle rewards business to Perk and the acquisition of the assets of Rant has changed our business model.\nThe sale of the Viggle rewards business to Perk and the acquisition of assets of Rant changed our business model. As a result of these transactions, we are a smaller business and are focused on the social publishing industry. Our revenue levels are likely to be different, and possibly lower, than those previously achieved. Our historic stock price has been volatile and the future market price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\nOur historic stock price has been volatile and the future market price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe public market for our common stock has historically been volatile. Any future market price for our shares is likely to continue to be volatile. This price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell shares when you want at prices you find attractive. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific companies. Broad market factors and the investing public\u2019s negative perception of our business may reduce our stock price, regardless of our operating performance. Further, the market for our common stock is limited and we cannot assure you that a larger market will ever be developed or maintained. Market fluctuations and volatility, as well as general economic, market and political conditions, could reduce our market price. As a result, these factors may make it more difficult or impossible for you to sell shares of our common stock for a positive return on your investment.\nWe have a history of losses, expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception. We incurred net losses of $63,689 and $78,539 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $428,380 as of June 30, 2016 and $367,360 as of June 30, 2015. We have not achieved profitability since inception and cannot be certain that we will ever achieve profitability. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions, increasing revenue in our remaining businesses throughout the year and keeping operating expenses below our revenue levels in order to achieve positive cash flows, none of which can be assured. If we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to remain a going concern because we have suffered recurring losses from operations and, at June 30, 2016, had a working capital deficiency. We are unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our largest stockholders and the ability of our Company to obtain necessary equity and debt financing to continue development of our business and to generate revenue. Management intends to raise additional funds through equity and debt offerings until sustainable revenues are developed. No assurance can be given that such equity and debt offerings will be successful or that development of our business will continue successfully.\nThe independent directors are exploring strategic alternatives. There can be no assurances that any transaction will occur, or if such a transaction does occur, the value of that transaction to our company or our stockholders.\nThe independent directors are exploring strategic alternatives to enhance value. These alternatives could include, among others, possible joint ventures, strategic partnerships, marketing alliances, acquisitions, sale of all or some of our assets or other possible transactions, including the possibility of reorganization. However, there can be no assurance that any such strategic transaction will occur or be successful. In addition, if such a transaction occurs, there can be no assurances as to the value of any such transaction to us or our stockholders. While continuing to explore strategic alternatives, we have approved: (i) recapitalization plan involving the conversion of $34,800 of debt held by SIC III, SIC IV and SIC VI, each an affiliate of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the conversion of 3,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock into up to 19,800,000 shares of our common stock; (ii) the Reverse Stock Split; (iii) the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Rant.\nExercise of convertible instruments and conversion of preferred stock will dilute your percentage of ownership and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we have outstanding stock options to purchase 45,351 shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock units for 4,042 shares of common stock. Exercise of any of these options or warrants, or conversion of any of the shares of preferred stock, would result in our issuing a significant number of additional shares of common stock. Additionally, we have more than 3 million shares available for issuance under the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan. In the future, we may further increase the number of shares available for issuance under that plan. We have entered into an Exchange Agreement (which modifies the Series C conversion price if effectuated) with affiliates of our Chief Executive Officer, Robert F.X. Sillerman that provides for the conversion of the $34,800 of debt held by Mr. Sillerman\u2019s affiliates and 3,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into up to 19,800,000 shares of our common stock. In connection with the Private Placement, we have issued convertible debentures and warrants that are convertible and exercisable for up to 3,502,318 shares of common stock (plus, if applicable, potential additional shares that may be required for liquidated damages.) The issuance of up to 9,484,691 shares of common stock upon the conversion of shares of our outstanding Series E Convertible Preferred stock and convertible notes issued to Rant would result in dilution of your percentage ownership of our Company.\nWe estimate that, if we issued all 35,417,054 (post Reverse Stock Split) of the shares that the Majority Shareholders have approved for issuance as described in the Information Statement on Schedule 14C filed August 19, 2016, existing shareholders, other than Mr. Sillerman, would own approximately 3.1% of the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after the conversion is completed.\nOn August 22, 2016, we and SIC III, SIC IV, and SIC VI entered into an Note Exchange Agreement pursuant to which $30,175 which represents all of the then outstanding principal and accrued interest of certain notes held by SIC III, SIC IV, and SIC VI (the \u201cSillerman Notes\u201d) other than $900 of debt held by SIC IV pursuant to that certain Line of Credit Grid Promissory Note dated as of June 11, 2015 (the \u201cSIC IV Note\u201d), was exchanged for 30,175 shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock. The exchange price (and therefore the number of shares set forth above) was $1,000 per share. The Note Exchange Agreement provided for the newly issued shares to be held subject to the obligations to convert the shares into common stock on the terms and on the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement described in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on July 13, 2016, and subject to the additional obligations set forth in the Subordination Agreement and the Lockup Agreements also described therein. The $900 of debt that remained outstanding under the SIC IV Note will also remain subject to the Exchange Agreement.\nWe may also grant additional stock options, warrants and convertible securities. The exercise, conversion or exchange of stock options, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our other stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $178,300. We generally are able to carry NOLs forward to reduce taxable income in future years. These NOLs will begin to expire in 2030, if not utilized before that time. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\u201cSection 382\u201d). Section 382 generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of stockholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of our common stock or are otherwise treated as five percent stockholders under Section 382 and the regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders over a three-year rolling period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that we may offset with NOLs. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our stock on the date of the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs.\nThe rules of Section 382 are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Because of our numerous capital raises, uncertainty exists as to whether we may have undergone an ownership change in the past or will undergo one as a result of the various transactions discussed herein. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our NOLs will be fully available or utilizable.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and market our products or features or our products or features do not perform as expected, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWith the release of any new product or any new features to an existing product, we are subject to the risks generally associated with new product or feature introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in development and implementation, and failure of new products or features to perform as expected. In order to introduce and market new or enhanced products or features successfully with minimal disruption in customer purchasing patterns and user experiences, we must manage the transition from existing products in the market. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market, on a timely basis, products, product enhancements or features that respond to technological advances by others, that our new products will adequately address the changing needs of the market or that we will successfully manage product transitions. Further, failure to generate sufficient cash from operations or financing activities to develop or obtain improved products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock that would dilute your ownership.\nWe have financed our operations, and we expect to continue to finance our operations and acquisitions and to develop strategic relationships, by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing common stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance or sale of other securities or instruments senior to our common stock. The holders of any debt securities or instruments we may issue would likely have rights superior to the rights of our common stockholders.\nSince a significant amount of our voting securities are controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and his affiliates, you and our other non-management stockholders may not be able to affect the outcome in matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of September 30, 2016, approximately 3,056,353 shares of our common stock, not including warrants, options, preferred stock or rights to acquire common stock, are owned by Mr. Sillerman and his affiliates, representing a significant percentage of the total voting power. As a result, Mr. Sillerman and his affiliates essentially have the ability to elect all of our directors and to approve any action requiring stockholder action. It is possible that the interests of Mr. Sillerman could conflict in certain circumstances with those of other stockholders. Such concentrated ownership may also make it difficult for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock in the event we merge with a third party or enter into other transactions that require stockholder approval. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Please refer to Note 16, Subsequent Events, for more information on Mr. Sillerman's potential to remain in control of the voting in the event of conversion of some or all of his debt and preferred stock positions.\nWe rely on key members of management, and the loss of their services could adversely affect our success and development.\nOur success depends on the expertise and continued service of Mr. Sillerman and certain other key executives and technical personnel. These individuals are a significant factor in our growth and ability to meet our business objectives. In particular, our success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and our directors, particularly Mr. Sillerman. It may be difficult to find a sufficiently qualified individual to replace Mr. Sillerman or other key executives in the event of death, disability or resignation, resulting in our being unable to satisfactorily execute our business. The loss of one or more of our executive officers and directors could slow the growth of our business, or it may cease to operate at all, which may result in the total loss of an investor\u2019s investment.\nCompensation may be paid to our executive officers, directors and employees regardless of our profitability, which may limit our ability to finance our business and adversely affect our business.\nMr. Sillerman and other executive officers are receiving compensation, and other current and future employees of our company may be entitled to receive compensation, payments and reimbursements regardless of whether we operate at a profit or a loss. Any compensation received by Mr. Sillerman or any other senior executive in the future will be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee. Such obligations may negatively affect our cash flow and our ability to finance our business, which could cause our business to be unsuccessful.\nSome of our executive officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in business opportunities that may be disadvantageous to us.\nMr. Sillerman and Mitchell J. Nelson, our Executive Vice President, Secretary and a director, are each engaged in other business endeavors, including Circle Entertainment Inc. (\u201cCircle\u201d), in which Mr. Nelson is an executive officer. Mr. Sillerman is also the Chairman of SFX, a company in the live entertainment business, which has filed in Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to reorganize its business. Under Mr. Sillerman\u2019s employment agreement, he is obligated to devote his working time to our affairs, but may continue to perform his responsibilities as Chairman of SFX and as a director of Circle, and may be involved in other outside non-competitive businesses. Mr. Sillerman has agreed to present to us any business opportunities related to or appropriate for our business. Pursuant to Mr. Nelson\u2019s employment agreement, he is obligated to devote such time and attention to the affairs of our company as is necessary for him to perform his duties as Executive Vice President. He is also entitled to perform similar functions for Circle, which is in liquidation. In addition, one of our directors, Michael Meyer, is a member of the board of directors and chair of the audit committee of Circle. Although Circle, SFX and our company have generally different business plans, interests and programs, it is conceivable there may be a conflict of interest in determining where a potential opportunity should be brought. Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of corporate policy, except under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors, as set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics also sets forth the procedures to follow in the event that a potential conflict of interest arises. In addition, not having the full time and attention of the executive officers could cause our business results to suffer.\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key officers or employees.\nOur ability to expand operations to accommodate our anticipated growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified media, management, finance, marketing, sales and technical personnel. However, competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in this regard. If we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are uncertain of our ability to manage our growth.\nOur ability to grow our business is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to hire, train and assimilate management and other employees, the adequacy of our financial resources, our ability to identify and efficiently provide such new products and services as our customers may require in the future, and our ability to adapt our own systems to accommodate expanded operations.\nBecause of pressures from competitors with more resources, we may fail to implement our business strategy profitably.\nThe social publishing business is highly fragmented, extremely competitive, and subject to rapid change. The market for customers is intensely competitive and such competition is expected to continue to increase. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and beyond our control, including the ability to generate content and attract readers. If we are\nsuccessful, larger and more established media companies, with significantly greater resources, may try to enter the market with similar products, and may be in better competitive positions than we are. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple digital brands and products and can easily shift consumption from one provider to another. Our principal competitors are in segments such as:\n\u2022\nDigital publishing network providing original content in sports, entertainment and pets\n\u2022\nDigital marketplace powering some of the largest loyalty programs\n\u2022\nDigital content providers\n\u2022\nCompanies with daily fantasy sports offerings\nAdditionally, new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost. Either existing or new competitors may develop new technologies, and our existing and potential advertisers may shift their advertising expenditures to these new technologies. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully execute our business in the face of such competition.\nFailure to successfully grow the Wetpaint, Rant, DraftDay or Choose Digital businesses in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.\nThe success of our acquisitions of Wetpaint, Rant, DraftDay, or Choose Digital will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such businesses. Our management may face significant challenges in developing Wetpaint\u2019s, Rant\u2019s, DraftDay's, or Choose Digital's businesses, and their respective technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing the different business cultures at these companies, and retaining key personnel. If Wetpaint, Rant, DraftDay, or Choose Digital are not successfully developed, the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions of these companies may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Developing these businesses may also be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort.\nWe will still incur significant transaction and merger-related expenses in connection with our acquisition of Choose Digital.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Choose Digital, we were required to make a contingent payment, which was due within five business days after June 24, 2015, of $4,800, which we failed to make timely. As a result, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement with AmossyKlein Family Holdings, LLLP (\"AmossyKlein\"), as representative of the former shareholders of Choose Digital Inc. (the \u201cStockholders\u201d). The Forbearance Agreement provided that we would make monthly installment payments to the Stockholders and we agreed to deliver an affidavit of confession of judgment to be held in escrow by AmossyKlein s counsel in the event that we do not make such installment payments. We made the installment payments through December 2015, but failed to make the payment due on January 29, 2016. On May 12, 2016, we and AmossyKlein entered into an amendment to the Forbearance Agreement to provide for the payment of the remaining $1,800. The Forbearance Agreement provides that we would make a payment of approximately $300 by May 18, 2016, and thereafter, we would make monthly payments of $100, plus interest, until the remaining amount is paid in full. In addition, we pledged 100,000 shares of common stock we hold in Perk.com, Inc. as collateral for these obligations. As of the date of this filing, $754 is owed and the 100,000 shares have been released. Finally, we agreed if we consummate a sale of a substantial part of our assets or a public equity offering, we will first apply the proceeds to remaining amounts due to AmossyKlein, except for payments to advisors or expenses necessary to close such transactions. We also agreed to amend the confession of judgment. These payments under the amended forbearance agreement will create additional strain on our limited cash resources. In addition, the requirement to accelerate payments on a sale of a substantial part of our assets or from a public equity offering may hinder our access to additional cash.\nWe will incur significant transaction and merger-related expenses in connection with our acquisition of our interest in DraftDay.\nIn connection with our acquisition of an interest in DraftDay, we were required to make payments pursuant to promissory note in the principal amount of $2,000 on March 8, 2016. We negotiated with the holders of these notes to pay a portion of the outstanding amounts in our common stock. We were able to retire approximately $1,000 of the amounts outstanding under the notes through the issuance of 147,812 shares of our common stock and 110 shares of our Series D preferred stock. The 110 shares of our common stock were convertible into 18,331 shares of our common stock. Approximately $1,000 of the principal amount of these notes remains outstanding and will now be payable on July 31, 2016. We entered into a transaction with MGT Sports to similarly retire the remaining portion of the notes in equity. However, there is no assurance that will be able to do so. In addition, if we are successful, the issuance of additional equity in satisfaction of these notes would result in dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe will incur significant transaction and integration expenses in connection with our acquisition of the assets of Rant.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the assets of Rant, we were required to make payments pursuant to a secured convertible promissory note (the \u201cRant Note\u201d) that bears interest at 12% per annum on principal amount of $3,000. The Rant Note matures on July 8, 2017. At the election of Rant, the secured convertible note is convertible into shares of our common stock at a price equal to the lower of (i) $5.20 per share, or (ii) such lower price as may have been set for conversion of any debt or securities into Common Stock held on or after the date hereof by Sillerman until the first to occur of March 31, 2017 or the date the Rant Note has been satisfied or converted. In connection with the Rant Note, we have entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and a Security Agreement with Rant, under which we have granted Rant a continuing security interest in substantially all of our assets. In connection with the issuance of the secured convertible note, Mr. Sillerman, his affiliates, and Rant entered into a subordination agreement subordinating repayment of the Rant Note to the Debentures and entered into an Intercreditor Agreement providing for the parties\u2019 respective rights and remedies with respect to payments against the collateral held as security for both of them. The issuance of additional equity in conversion of the Rant Note would result in dilution to existing stockholders.\nIf we do not continue to develop and offer compelling content, products and services and attract new consumers or maintain the engagement of our existing consumers, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nIn order to attract consumers and maintain or increase engagement on our Wetpaint, Rant. DraftDay and Choose Digital properties, we believe that we must offer compelling content, products and services. Acquiring, developing and offering new content, products and services, as well as new functionality, features and enhanced performance of our existing content, products and services, may require significant investment and time to develop. In addition, consumer tastes are difficult to predict and subject to rapid change. If we are unable to develop online content, products and services that are attractive and relevant to Wetpaint, Rant, DraftDay and Choose Digital users, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing users\u2019 engagement on or attract new consumers to Choose Digital, DraftDay and Wetpaint and as a result our search rankings, traffic and usage metrics, and advertising revenues may be adversely affected.\nWetpaint and Rant rely on social media posts to drive traffic to its websites. Changes in rules, algorithms, and display formats of social media sites could result in a reduction in such traffic.\nWetpaint and Rant rely on posts on various social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, to drive users to its websites. In the event that Facebook or Twitter changes their respective terms and conditions to prevent such activity by Wetpaint or Rant, their user numbers could decrease. Further, these platforms change their algorithms and application programming interfaces, or API\u2019s, in the ordinary course of business, often without notice or explanation to publishers. Changes to these algorithms and API\u2019s may reduce the effectiveness of Wetpaint\u2019s and Rant's publishing capabilities, and result in temporary or permanent reductions to the net numbers of fans and followers added each month, as well as the rate at which Wetpaint or Rant content is displayed to users and clicked upon. In such cases, traffic to Wetpaint or Rant websites could be adversely affected.\nWetpaint and Rant rely upon traffic from search engines such as Google to bring an influx of website visitors each month. Search engine traffic is dynamic in nature, and is subject to an ever-changing mix of user-entered keywords, competitive offerings, and algorithmic fluctuations by the search engines themselves.\nSearch engines such as Google represent a significant source of Wetpaint and Rant traffic, and the originating source for many users who become Wetpaint or Rant fans and followers on the social networks. The ranking of Wetpaint and Rant content in the various search engines is always changing, and relates to algorithmic assessments by the search engines compared to offerings that compete with Wetpaint and Rant. The popular keywords for which Wetpaint or Rant rank highly could subside in their popularity, or Wetpaint or Rant may fail to maintain the rankings that it has had for such keywords. In addition, as new keywords become popular, Wetpaint or Rant content may fail to rank highly for those keywords.\nIf Wetpaint and Rant do not maintain talent, access, and reputation among sources for news stories, we would lose access to stories and our traffic and revenues could suffer.\nWetpaint and Rant are reliant upon an editorial organization and freelance talent that secures proprietary access to stories that interest our audience. Our ability to identify and create content that interests the audience is dependent on maintaining and growing our access to talent and sources. If we lose key editorial talent, or our reputation is not maintained, we could lose our ability to create the content that garners audience interests, and traffic and our revenues could be adversely affected.\nChoose Digital previously generated a significant amount of its content sales through the Viggle App, which has now been sold to Perk. If Perk does not offer content provided by Choose Digital, or if it uses less content provided by Choose Digital than we used previously, Choose Digital's business could suffer.\nThe Viggle App, which provides rewards to its users, previously offered digital content provided through Choose Digital.\nThe content provided through the Viggle App was a significant part of Choose Digital's sales. The Viggle App is now owned and operated by Perk. There can be no assurance that Perk will offer digital content provided through Choose Digital, or that Perk will offer digital content at the same levels that were offered historically. For this and other reasons, Choose Digital's revenues have declined considerably, and the Company is in the process of restructuring the Choose digital business.\nOur business will suffer if our network systems fail or become unavailable.\nA reduction in the performance, reliability and availability of our network infrastructure would harm our ability to distribute our products to our users, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain users and content providers. Our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our systems could also be subject to viruses, break-ins, sabotage, acts of terrorism, acts of vandalism, hacking, cyber-terrorism and similar misconduct. We might not carry adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage. Any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of products, or an increase in response time, could result in a loss of potential customers or content providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions, our products and services could be less attractive to our users and our business would be materially harmed.\nThe SEC opened a formal order of investigation relating to a matter regarding certain dealings in our securities by an unaffiliated third party. In addition, we have also received an informal request from the SEC for the voluntary production of documents and information concerning certain aspects of our business and technology. Although we have provided documents in response to the SEC's request, there is no assurance that the SEC will not take any action against us.\nThe SEC opened a formal order of investigation relating to a matter regarding certain dealings in our securities by an unaffiliated third party. We have also received an informal request from the staff of the SEC, dated June 11, 2012, for the voluntary production of documents and information concerning certain aspects of our business and technology. We initially provided documents in response to such request on July 2, 2012, and we have provided supplements and documents for additional questions, as requested. We intend to cooperate with the SEC regarding this matter and any other requests we may receive. However, there is no assurance that the SEC will not take any action against us. A determination by the SEC to take action against us could be costly and time consuming, could divert the efforts and attention of our directors, officers and employees from the operation of our business and could result in sanctions against us, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nChanges to federal, state or international laws or regulations applicable to our business could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to privacy, advertising generally, consumer protection, content regulation, intellectual property, defamation, child protection, advertising to and collecting information from children, taxation, employment classification and billing. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting our business could be enacted. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of management's attention. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are many federal, state and international laws that may affect our business, including measures to regulate consumer privacy, the use of copyrighted material, the collection of certain data, network neutrality, patent protection, cyber security, child protection, subpoena and warrant processes, taxes and tax reporting (including issuing Internal Revenue Service 1099 forms to our users), gift cards, employee classification, employee health care, and others. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, most states have enacted legislation governing the breach of data security in which sensitive consumer information is released or accessed. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our potential partners are subject to industry specific laws, regulations or licensing requirements, including in the following industries: pharmaceuticals, online gaming, alcohol, adult content, tobacco, firearms, insurance, securities brokerage, real estate, sweepstakes, free trial offers, automatic renewal services and legal services. If any of our advertising partners fail to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, these laws may also limit the way we advertise our products and services or cause us to incur compliance costs, which could affect our\nrevenues and could further adversely impact our business.\nThere are a number of significant matters under review and discussion with respect to government regulations which may affect the business we intend to enter and/or harm our customers, and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has substantial indebtedness and trade payables.\nWe currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness and trade payables. These obligations could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage and expose us to interest rate fluctuations. As of June 30, 2016, we had total indebtedness of approximately $28,712 and trade payables of approximately $5,255, in addition to the transaction and merger-related expenses relating to the acquisitions of Choose Digital and an interest in the DraftDay Business. The $28,712 is subject to security agreements in favor of Mr. Sillerman or his affiliates. On August 22, 2016, we and SIC III, SIC IV, and SIC VI, each an affiliate of Sillerman, entered into a Note Exchange Agreement pursuant to which all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of certain notes held by SIC III, SIC IV, and SIC VI other than $900 of debt held by SIC IV pursuant to that certain Line of Credit Grid Promissory Note dated as of June 11, 2015, was exchanged for 30,175 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock.\nWhile we have attempted to settle with many of the vendors to which the trade payables are owed, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so at all or be able to do so on favorable terms. Failure to settle these trade payables could result in litigation, which could lead to attachments and liens on our assets. In addition, vendors could potentially seek to file against us involuntary reorganization proceedings.\nWe expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses, to pay our trade payables and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from our operations and potentially from other debt and/or equity offerings. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may be unable to do on acceptable terms, and forgo attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nOur earnings are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other political conditions may cause a downturn in the market for our products or services. Despite the recent improvements in market conditions, a future downturn in the market for our products or services could adversely affect our operating results and increase the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings. Our future operating results may be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated advertisers and publishers; our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and services on a timely basis; changes in the mix of products developed, produced and sold; and disputes with our advertisers and publishers. These factors affecting our future earnings are difficult to forecast and could harm our quarterly and/or annual operating results.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have noted material weaknesses in internal control over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We intend to remediate these issues and have started efforts in that regard. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nWe made an investment in DraftDay, which operates a daily fantasy sports website. Companies with daily fantasy sports\nofferings operate in an unclear and evolving regulatory environment. If a regulator, state attorney general or U.S. Attorney takes the position that DDGG's business operates in violation of applicable laws, or if laws are changed, it could force DDGG to cease operating in certain states or to change its business models in ways that could materially and negatively impact its business. Current regulations require that the DraftDay Business operate in a manner that may result in financial risk.\nAt a U.S. federal level, Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (\"UIGEA\") prohibits online gambling practices, but exempts fantasy sports, as long as they operate within certain parameters. The UIGEA specifically exempts fantasy sports games, educational games, or any online contest that \"has an outcome that reflects the relative knowledge of the participants, or their skill at physical reaction or physical manipulation (but not chance), and, in the case of a fantasy or simulation sports game, has an outcome that is determined predominantly by accumulated statistical results of sporting events, including any non- participant's individual performances in such sporting events...\" However, all prizing must be determined and announced in advance of the competition and cannot be influenced by the fees or number of participants. This creates financial risk because we must determine prizes for games in advance, and if we do not have enough paying players in a game to cover the amount of the prize for the game, we could experience significant losses.\nDDGG's business is subject to an evolving legislative and regulatory landscape. Some states employ a \u201cpredominance\u201d test or a \u201cmaterial factor\u201d test to determine whether or not a game is one of skill. Others have specific laws prohibiting pay-to- play fantasy sports. Therefore, DDGG does not operate in Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, or Washington. Several state Attorneys General have issued opinions that daily fantasy sports either does or does not meet the states standards under their current laws. In those states with negative treatment, DDGG has suspended services until there is further clarity in those states through the legal, legislative, and regulatory processes. On November 10, 2015, the New York State Attorney General issued a letter to FanDuel and DraftKings, two of the largest competitors in the fantasy sports industry, stating that it believes that their activities constitute illegal gambling under New York law, and instructing them to cease their offerings to New York residents. As a result, DDGG has ceased its fantasy sports offerings to New York residents. However, on August 3, 2016, New York enacted a law that legalizes and regulates fantasy sports in New York. DDGG intends to seek that approval to operate from the New York state regulators. Approximately 33 states have introduced legislation authorizing and regulating daily fantasy sports ranging from clarifying current state laws to adding new laws regarding daily fantasy sports. DDGG continues to monitor the changing landscape and advocates a favorable position for daily fantasy sports in each of these states. However, any such change could materially and adversely affect DraftDay's business.\nDraftDay competes against well-established competitors in the fantasy sports industry. If DraftDay's products do not achieve market acceptance, it may be unable to generate revenues, may experience significant losses, and may require additional capital to continue operations.\nDraftDay competes with FanDuel and DraftKings, two established companies in the fantasy sports industry, as well as other competitors. Those competitors have already achieved a higher degree of market acceptance and have a large amount of resources to continue to expand their brands and competitive positions. Competing directly with these more established companies would require significant capital resources. In order to compete, DraftDay intends to establish marketing and white label relationships with various third parties. However, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful, that DraftDay will be able to establish any such white label or marketing relationships or, even if it does, that such relationships will be successful in competing against other competitors in the industry.\nWe have suffered a loss of human capital as a result of the Perk Transaction. If we are unable to replace the employees lost, we may not be able to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace.\nAs a result of the Perk Transaction and the resulting changes in our business, many of our employees have become Perk employees and others have left our Company. If we are unable to replace these employees, we may not have the manpower necessary to sell advertising, to market and publicize our businesses and to take advantage of changing market conditions.\nWe may be unable to compete with larger or more established companies.\nWe face a large and growing number of competitors across all our lines of business. Wetpaint and Rant are content publishers, and they face many competitors with far greater resources. They face competition from traditional media sources, such as newspapers and magazines, many of which have their own digital properties, as well as competition from other digital and online publishers, such as Buzzfeed and Vox Media., and many others. Choose Digital competes with other digital content providers. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and more established relationships in these industries than do we. In addition, as described in greater detail above, DraftDay faces competition from DraftKings and FanDuel, each of which has far\ngreater established customer bases, name recognition, marketing resources and financial resources than DraftDay. As a result, certain of these competitors may be in better positions to compete with us for customers and audiences. Further, our current and/ or future competitors in the digital and mobile technology industry may develop or license technology that is similar to ours. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors.\nIf our products do not achieve market acceptance, we may not have sufficient financial resources to fund our operations or further development.\nWhile we believe that a viable market exists for our products, there is no assurance that our technology will prove to be an attractive alternative to conventional or competitive products in the markets that we have identified. In the event that a viable market for our products cannot be created for our business or our products do not achieve market acceptance, we may need to commit greater resources than are currently available to develop a commercially viable and competitive product. There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient financial resources to fund such development or that such development would be successful. In addition, if our products do not generate sufficient revenues, or we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be unable to fund our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that, when required, sufficient funds will be available to us on satisfactory terms.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third-party claims and litigation, which could be expensive, divert management's attention, and harm our business.\nOur success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to us. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. In the event a competitor or other party successfully challenges our products, processes, patents or licenses, or claims that we have infringed upon their intellectual property, we could incur substantial litigation costs defending against such claims, be required to pay royalties, license fees or other damages or be barred from using the intellectual property at issue, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely substantially on trade secrets, proprietary technology, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements, and technical measures to protect our technology, application, design, and manufacturing know-how, and work actively to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position. We cannot assure you that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property and other contractual agreements for our business will be adequate, that our competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies or be able to design around patents that we may receive, or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated.", "PERMNO": 88285, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "FNCX"}
