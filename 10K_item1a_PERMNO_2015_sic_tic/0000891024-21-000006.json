RISK FACTORS\nWe believe that the following risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial results, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock. In addition, our business operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations, so you should not consider the risks disclosed in this section to necessarily represent a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. The order in which these factors appear does not necessarily reflect their relative importance or priority.\nCOMPANY RISKS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto had, and may continue to have, adverse effects on our results of operations and our financial condition, and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and continue to have, an unprecedented impact on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased unemployment and economic uncertainty. Beginning in March 2020, across our markets authorities implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and business shutdowns, and continued to implement such measures as new waves of infection developed. These measures had negative impacts on consumer spending and business spending habits that adversely impacted our financial results and the financial results of our customers, suppliers and business partners during fiscal 2021, and are expected to continue to have negative impacts into fiscal 2022.\nIn our markets of the U.S., Canada, and the UK, restrictive measures have now been lifted or are expected to be lifted soon, sometimes subject to social distancing and capacity restrictions, due to the rapid pace of vaccination and improving local case rates. However, other areas around the world continue to suffer. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering another shutdown, for example due to the emergence of a variant not effected by existing vaccines. In addition, COVID-19 continues to have a material effect on the macroeconomic environment, and there is continued uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact.\nActual and potential impacts on us from the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Interruptions in the operations of industries in which the products we distribute are used. Our fiscal 2021 results were adversely affected by mandated and voluntary restrictions on the operations of dental and veterinary offices across the U.S., Canada and the UK to limit the spread of COVID-19 beginning in March 2020, along with consumers delaying elective visits even when offices were open. These restrictions have begun to ease across our markets, but continuing economic uncertainty remains. In addition, the interruptions in meatpacking operations that occurred due to the pandemic factored into the full goodwill impairment of the animal health business in fiscal 2020. We have also been affected by, and continue to be affected by, disruptions in the swine market.\n\u2022Limited supply of the personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary for dental practice and veterinary care of companion animals followed by related inventory write down. Supply chain disruptions for PPE and an increased demand for these products initially resulted in backorders of PPE and a potential scarcity in raw materials to make PPE, causing substantial price increases. We had to prepay suppliers in order to obtain PPE for resale to our customers, and as manufacturing caught up to increased demand for PPE, prices dropped, impacting our margins and requiring us to write down certain inventory.\n\u2022Reduction in peoples\u2019 ability and willingness to be in public. Consumer behavior was materially changed by mandates and recommendations designed to slow and limit the transmission of COVID-19 (including business closures and restrictions, stay-at-home and similar measures), beginning in March 2020. While such restrictions have generally been lifted or are expected to be lifted, consumer behavior remains uncertain and will depend on the actual and potential for additional resurgences of COVID-19.\n\u2022Risks of remote work. Most of our corporate employees shifted abruptly to working remotely under stay-at-home orders imposed in March 2020, and many of our corporate employees continue to work remotely. Our rapid transition to remote work arrangements for corporate employees could expose us to continuing cybersecurity risk.\n\u2022Refocusing management resources. Mitigating the effects of COVID-19 has required, and will likely continue to require for the duration of the pandemic, a large investment of time and resources across our company, and may delay certain strategic and other plans which could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Reputational risk associated with response to COVID-19. If we do not respond appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Interruptions in manufacturing or distribution of products we distribute. Outbreaks in the communities in which we operate could affect our ability to operate our distribution activities, and our suppliers could experience similar manufacturing interruptions.\nEven after COVID-19 has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19, or a similar health epidemic or pandemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our dental and animal health businesses, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material adverse impact on us.\nCustomer retention and business development depend heavily on our relationships with our sales representatives and service technicians, who interact directly with our customers, and the technological products and services we offer.\nThe inability to attract or retain qualified employees, particularly sales representatives and service technicians who relate directly with our customers, or our inability to build or maintain relationships with customers in the dental and animal health markets, may have an adverse effect on our business. Due to the specialized nature of many of the products and services we distribute, generally only highly qualified and trained personnel have the necessary skills to market such products and provide such services. These individuals develop relationships with our customers that could be damaged if these employees are not retained. We face intense competition for the hiring of these professionals, and many professionals in the field that may otherwise be attractive candidates for us to hire may be bound by non-competition agreements with our competitors. Any failure on our part to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionals would damage our business.\nDue to generational and other trends in the dental and animal health industries, our customer base is increasingly interested in having the latest technologies to manage their business. In order to effectively offer solutions that keep pace with rapidly changing technologies and customer expectations, we must acquire, develop or offer new technology products and solutions. If we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers\u2019 needs through the acquisition, development or distribution of new products, technologies and service offerings, if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, if the products we distribute and services we provide are not widely accepted or if current or future offerings fail to meet applicable regulatory requirements, we could lose customers to our competitors which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if technology investments do not achieve the intended results, we may write-off the investments, and we face the risk of claims from system users that the systems failed to produce the intended result or negatively affected the operation of our customers\u2019 businesses. Any such claims could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, cause us to lose customers and associated revenue, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, or require us to pay damages.\nDisruption to our distribution capabilities, including service issues with our third-party shippers, could materially adversely affect our results.\nWeather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, civil unrest, geopolitical events or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute products and conduct our business. If we are unable to manage effectively such events if they occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations. Similarly, increases in service costs or service issues with our third-party shippers, including strikes or other service interruptions, could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and often times bear the cost of shipment. Our ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of our business strategy and any significant increase in shipping rates or service interruptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers and exposed to the risks of their businesses, because we generally do not manufacture the products we sell.\nWe obtain substantially all of the products we distribute from third parties. If a supplier is unable to deliver product in a timely and efficient manner, whether due to financial difficulties, natural disasters, pandemics, the failure to comply with applicable government requirements or other reasons, we could experience lost sales.\nThere is considerable concentration within our animal health and dental businesses with a few key suppliers. In addition, a portion of the products we distribute is sourced, directly or indirectly, from countries outside the U.S. including China. Political or financial instability, increased tariffs, restrictions on trade, currency exchange rates, labor unrest, pandemics or other events could slow distribution activities, affect foreign trade beyond our control and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers, so they may be discontinued or changed abruptly. Changes in the structure of purchasing relationships might include changing from a \u201cbuy/sell\u201d to an agency relationship (or the reverse), or changing the method in which products are taken to market, including the possibility of creating or expanding a direct sales force or otherwise reducing their reliance on third-party distribution channels. An extended interruption in the supply of products would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and a reduction in our role as a value-added service provider would result in reduced margins on product sales.\nThe products we sell are subject to market and technological obsolescence; our software products may contain undetected errors or bugs when released.\nSome of the products we distribute are subject to technological obsolescence outside of our control, since we do not manufacture the majority of the products we sell. If our customers discontinue purchasing a given product, we might have to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock, and depending on the magnitude, that expense could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced, or as new versions are released. Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software, as well as our reputation. We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common-law protections. We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available, adequate or enforceable in a timely manner to protect our software or e-services products.\nAdverse changes in supplier rebates could negatively affect our business.\nThe terms on which we purchase or sell products from many suppliers of animal health products may entitle us to receive a rebate based on the attainment of certain growth goals. Suppliers may reduce or eliminate rebates offered under their programs, or increase the growth goals or other conditions we must meet to earn rebates to levels that we cannot achieve. Increased competition either from generic or equivalent branded products could result in us failing to earn rebates that are conditioned upon achievement of growth goals. Additionally, factors outside of our control, such as customer preferences, consolidation of suppliers or supply issues, can have a material impact on our ability to achieve the growth goals established by our suppliers, which may reduce the amount of rebates we receive. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nSales of private label products entail additional risks, including the risk that such sales could adversely affect our relationships with suppliers.\nWe offer certain private label products that are available exclusively from us. The sale of such products subjects us to the risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private label products, including but not limited to potential product liability risks, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions, and potential intellectual property infringement risks. Any failure to adequately address\nsome or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, an increase in the sales of our private label products may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which, consequently, could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. As a distribution company, any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty.\nPatterson\u2019s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Patterson\u2019s reputation.\nOne of the reasons why customers choose to do business with Patterson and why employees choose Patterson as a place of employment is the reputation that Patterson has built over many years. To be successful in the future, Patterson must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Patterson\u2019s brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Patterson\u2019s brand and lead to adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks inherent in asset or business acquisitions and dispositions could offset the anticipated benefits of such transactions, and we may face difficulty in efficiently and effectively integrating acquired businesses.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we acquire and dispose of assets and businesses in the ordinary course and may continue acquiring and disposing of assets and businesses in the future. These transactions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability, and may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.\nAcquisition risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; acquisition-related earnings charges; and acquisition-related cybersecurity risks. Additionally, when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives. Alternatively, we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the acquired or divested business, or other conditions outside our control, could affect our future financial results.\nAs we operate through two strategic business units, we consolidate the distribution, information technology, human resources, financial and other administrative functions of those business units jointly to meet their needs while addressing distinctions in the individual markets of those segments. We may not be able to do so effectively and efficiently.\nOur ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success in identifying suitable targets, which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability, as well as the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, whether restrictions are imposed by anti-trust or other regulations, and compliance with the terms and conditions of our credit agreement.\nOur credit agreements contain restrictive covenants and additional limits and our other debt instruments contain cross-default provisions, which limit our business and financing activities.\nThe covenants under our credit agreements impose restrictions on our business and financing activities, subject to certain exceptions or the consent of our lenders, including, among other things, limits on our ability to incur additional debt, create liens, enter into merger, acquisition and divestiture transactions, pay dividends and engage in transactions with affiliates. The credit agreements contain certain customary affirmative covenants, including requirements that we maintain maximum consolidated leverage ratios and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, pursuant to which we may be affected by changes in interest rates, and customary events of default. The terms of agreements governing debt that we may incur in the future may also contain similar covenants.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be adversely affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of the credit agreement covenants may result in an event of default, which could allow our lenders to terminate the commitments under the credit agreement, declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, and exercise other rights and remedies, and, through cross-default provisions, would entitle our other lenders to accelerate their loans. If this occurs, we may not be able to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, or otherwise repay the accelerated indebtedness.\nLeadership development and succession planning are key to our future success.\nWhile our Board of Directors and management actively monitor our succession plans and processes for our executive leadership team, our business could suffer if we lose key personnel unexpectedly. In addition, competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur governing documents, other documents to which we are a party, and Minnesota law may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and Minnesota law could diminish the opportunity for shareholders to participate in acquisition proposals at a price above the then-current market price of our common stock. For example, while we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock, our Board of Directors, without further shareholder approval, may issue up to approximately 30 million shares of undesignated preferred stock and fix the powers, preferences, rights and limitations of such class or series, which could adversely affect the voting power of our common stock. Further, as a Minnesota corporation, we are subject to provisions of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, or MBCA, regarding \u201ccontrol share acquisitions\u201d and \u201cbusiness combinations.\u201d We may also, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. In addition, certain equity plans predating our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan provide for acceleration of awards thereunder upon a change in control or other events of acceleration, as defined in those plans. The foregoing, and any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nThe dental and animal health supply markets are highly competitive and consolidating, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nOur competitors include national, regional and local full-service distributors, mail-order distributors and Internet-based businesses. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do, or operate through different sales and distribution models that could allow them to compete more successfully.\nMost of the products we distribute are available from multiple sources, and our customers tend to have relationships with several different distributors who can fulfill their orders. If any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor such as technological advances or low-cost business models with the ability to operate at high gross margins, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Increased competition from any supplier of dental or animal health products could adversely impact our financial results. Additional competitive pressure could arise from, among other things, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products or services being introduced into a particular market, the emergence of new competitors, the unavailability of products, price reductions by competitors, and the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale. Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce the role of distributors. These suppliers could sell their products at lower prices and maintain a higher gross margin on product sales than we can. In addition, our ability to deliver market growth is challenged by an animal health product mix that is weighted toward lower growth, lower margin parts of the value chain.\nConsolidation has increased among manufacturers as well as distributors, which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by competitors, or as competitors with lower cost business models are able to offer lower prices but retain high gross margin. In addition, in recent years there has also been a trend towards consolidation in the industries that buy the products and services we distribute, including the consolidation of dental practices into larger clinics and dental service organizations, the consolidation of veterinary practices as well as producers, and the formation of group purchasing organizations, provider networks and buying groups designed to leverage volume discounts. We also face pricing pressure from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. We may be unable to\nanticipate and effectively respond to competitive change, and our failure to compete effectively may limit and/or reduce our revenue, profitability and cash flow.\nOur animal health segment is exposed to the risks of the production animal business, including changes in consumer demand for food animal products, the cyclical livestock market, and other factors outside our control.\nDemand for our production animal health products can be negatively influenced by factors including: poor weather conditions such as drought, which raise feed prices and cause producers to reduce herd size; changes in consumer preferences away from food animal products; supply chain disruptions including due to cyberattack, as happened to meat company JBS SA in June 2021, or actions by animal rights activists; and outbreaks of diseases affecting animals, any of which could reduce herd sizes or affect consumer preferences. Reductions in herd size would ultimately decrease the demand for the products we distribute, including micro feed ingredients, animal health products, and dairy sanitation solutions, as well as the development and implementation of systems for feed, health, information and production animal management.\nIn addition, there has been consumer concern and consumer activism with respect to additives (including, without limitation, antibiotics and growth promotants) used in the production of animal products, including growing consumer sentiment for proteins and dairy products produced without the use of antibiotics or other products intended to increase animal production. These concerns have resulted in increased regulation and changing market demand. If there is an increased public perception that consumption of food derived from animals that utilize additives we distribute poses a risk to human health, there may be a further decline in the production of those food products and, in turn, our sales of those products. Furthermore, regulatory restrictions and bans could result in the removal from market of products in these categories, which would adversely affect the sales and could materially affect the results of operations from our animal health segment.\nThe formation of group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d), provider networks and buying groups may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe formation of GPOs, provider networks and buying groups may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. As a full-service distributor with business service capabilities, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully compete with price-oriented distribution models that more readily enable the pricing typically demanded by GPOs, provider networks and buying groups.\nIncreases in over-the-counter sales of and e-commerce options for companion animal products, or sales of companion animal products from non-veterinarian sources, could adversely affect our business.\nCompanion animal health products are becoming increasingly available to consumers at competitive prices from sources other than veterinarians, including human health product pharmacies, Internet pharmacies and big-box retailers, and consumers are increasingly seeking such alternatives sources of supply for their companion animal health products. Additionally, major U.S. online e-commerce retailers such as Amazon and Chewy.com are becoming licensed as veterinary mail order pharmacies to offer pharmacy products directly to consumers in all 50 U.S. states. Even where prescriptions must be written by a veterinarian, companion animal owners may shift to these services for home delivery. In addition, companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal-health products if they deem human health products to be acceptable, lower-cost alternatives.\nDecreased emphasis on veterinary visits, and increased consumer choice through familiar e-commerce retailers could reduce demand for veterinarian-based services and have a material adverse impact on our business. The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis. The emergence of such competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nREGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS\nChange and uncertainty in the health care industry, including continued implementation of the Health Care Reform, could materially adversely affect our business.\nLaws and regulations affecting the health care industry in the U.S. have changed dramatically in recent years, and we expect that future and pending legislation, rulemaking, and court decisions on legal challenges to the Health Care Reform Law will further change the landscape. Foreign government authorities may also adopt reforms of their health systems. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. The continued uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan.\nRecently, there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President, and various states, including several bills that have been introduced on a federal level. Such legislation, if enacted, could have the potential to impose additional costs on our business.\nOne provision of the Health Care Reform Law, the Sunshine Act, requires us to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. We may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. Our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us. In the U.S., government actions to seek to increase health-related price transparency may also affect our business.\nFailure to comply with existing and future U.S. and foreign laws and regulatory requirements, including those governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is subject to additional requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the sale and distribution of, and third-party payment for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products (\u201cHCT/P products\u201d) and animal feed and supplements. Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:\n\u2022regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices, including requirements with respect to unique medical device identifiers;\n\u2022subject us to inspection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the \u201cDEA\u201d) and similar state authorities;\n\u2022regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain products that are considered hazardous materials;\n\u2022regulate the distribution and storage of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances;\n\u2022require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;\n\u2022require registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n\u2022require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;\n\u2022require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA;\n\u2022require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities;\n\u2022impose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.\n\u2022require manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers of prescription drugs to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed;\n\u2022require the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party logistics providers; and\n\u2022mandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs, and associated reporting requirements.\nThere also have been increasing efforts by Congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy, departments of health, and the FDA, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system. The failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business. If it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees, and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses. Non-compliance with government requirements could also adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and damage our reputation.\nFor example, as disclosed in our prior periodic reports, our subsidiary Animal Health International was recently the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Virginia, which resulted in Animal Health International pleading guilty to a strict-liability misdemeanor offense in connection with its failure to comply with federal law relating to the sales of prescription animal health products, and a total criminal fine and forfeiture of $52.8 million. In addition, Animal Health International and Patterson entered into a non-prosecution agreement for other non-compliant licensing, dispensing, distribution and related sales processes disclosed during the investigation and committed to undertake additional compliance program enhancements and provide compliance certifications through fiscal 2023. This matter may continue to divert management's attention and cause us to suffer reputational harm. We also may be subject to other fines or penalties, equitable remedies (including but not limited to the suspension, revocation or non-renewal of licenses) and litigation. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPublic concern over the abuse of opioid medications in the U.S., including increased legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business.\nCertain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the U.S. Federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the distribution of opioid medications.\nWhile our subsidiaries have been dismissed without prejudice from national class-action opiate litigation, as disclosed in our prior periodic reports, we could face similar civil claims or governmental investigations in the future. Managing legal proceedings and responding to government investigations is costly and involves a significant diversion of management attention. Such proceedings are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy periods of time. An adverse resolution of lawsuits or investigations may involve substantial monetary penalties and could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations, including those referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws\u201d and \u201canti-kickback\u201d laws. Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our practice management products that offer billing-related functionality.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private regulators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties, as well as other fraud and abuse laws. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including product liability claims, intellectual property claims, employment claims, commercial disputes, governmental inquiries and investigations, and other matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including securities litigation. From time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products. Additionally, purchasers of private-label products may seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims. Another potential risk we face in the distribution of products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain. In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials. The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability or legal action that could harm our reputation.\nDefending against such claims may divert our management\u2019s attention, may be expensive, and may require that we pay damage awards or settlements, pay fines or penalties, or become subject to equitable remedies (including but not limited to the revocation of or non-renewal of licenses) that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by insurance or indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation. Furthermore, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\nIf we fail to comply with the evolving laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nOur practice management products and services include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. Both we and our customers are subject to numerous and evolving laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records. Furthermore, our products may be used as part of our customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. We are also subject to non-healthcare-specific requirements of the countries and states in which we operate which govern the handling, storage, use and protection of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, that will become effective on January 1, 2023, and the pan-European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.\nIn addition, the FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices. Certain of our software and related products support practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.\nBoth in the U.S. and abroad, these laws and regulations continue to evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be required to make significant changes to our products or services, or incur substantial fines, penalties, or other liabilities. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, new or existing laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling the products or services we distribute, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our decision to distribute such products or services. Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to conform to these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn addition, the products and services we distribute may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in these products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use these products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy or security requirements, may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial damages, fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions which are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. In addition, although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nOur international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nThere are a number of risks inherent in foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, complex regulatory requirements, staffing and management complexities, import and export costs, other economic factors and political considerations, all of which are subject to unanticipated changes.\nOur foreign operations also expose us to foreign currency fluctuations. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies will have an impact on our income. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we generally do not hedge translation exposure with respect to foreign operations.\nGENERAL RISKS\nRisks generally associated with information systems and cyber-security attacks could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on information systems (\u201cIS\u201d) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and store customer, product, supplier, and employee data to conduct our business. However, our IS are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, cybersecurity threats, and other problems. We increasingly rely upon server- and Internet-based technologies to run our business and to store our data and our customers\u2019 data, which depends on continuous Internet access in order to run our business and may carry additional cyber-security risks relative to those posed by legacy technologies.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations, and divert attention of management.\nFurther, our suppliers, our customers, and other market participants are similarly subject to information system and cybersecurity risk, and a material disruption in their business could result in reduced revenue for us. For example, in June 2021 a ransomware attack on Brazil-based JBS SA, the world\u2019s largest meat company by sales, took a significant portion of U.S. beef and pork processing offline, disrupting markets.\nIn addition, compliance with evolving privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with these laws and standards, failure to protect information, or failure to respond appropriately to an incident or misuse of information, including use of information for unauthorized marketing purposes.\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if our IS are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyber-security attacks, or fail for any extended period of time. Disaster recovery plans, where in place, might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions we take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers. We may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against, or to address problems caused by, any business interruptions or data security breaches.\nWe may experience significant disruptions in our operations resulting from our enterprise resource planning system.\nWe depend on our information technology systems and our financial shared services for the efficient functioning of our business, including accounting, billing, data storage, purchasing and inventory management. In addition, we have implemented an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system across certain significant operating locations to support our operations. The operation of this ERP system requires the investment of human and financial resources. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses as we continue to enhance and develop our ERP system. As a result of our ERP system, we may encounter difficulties in operating our business, which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, manage customer billing and otherwise adequately service our customers, and lead to increased costs and other difficulties. If we experience significant disruptions resulting from our ERP system, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn fiscal 2020, we recorded impairment charges that eliminated our Animal Health segment\u2019s goodwill, and we may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings if our Dental segment\u2019s goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. We recorded a $269.0 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in our Animal Health segment as part of management\u2019s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests using the beginning of our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter as the valuation date. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we tested our goodwill for impairment again in April 2020 and recorded an additional $406.1 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of our Animal Health reporting unit\u2019s goodwill, based on management\u2019s estimates of future cash flows, driven by reduced sales volumes, as well as reduced EBITDA multiples of comparable companies. As of April 25, 2020, our Animal Health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as a result of the total goodwill impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of $675.1 million. If future impairment of our Dental segment\u2019s goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period of such determination under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.", "PERMNO": 78034, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "PDCO"}
