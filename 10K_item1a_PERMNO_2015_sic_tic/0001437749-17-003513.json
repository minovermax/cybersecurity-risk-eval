{"cik": "1632127", "company": "Cable One, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face. Some of the risks relate to our business, others to the spin-off. Some risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face significant competition from other cable companies and telephone companies, as well as other well-capitalized entrants in the video and data services industry, which could reduce our market share and lower our profits.\nWe operate in highly competitive, subscriber-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products, services and content to subscribers. Our competitors have historically included, and we expect will continue to include, over-the-air reception providers; DBS providers; telephone companies that offer data and video services through DSL or fiber-to-the-node networks; and other cable companies that have been granted a franchise to operate in a geographic market in which we are already operating.\nSubstantially all of our cable systems are in markets in which CenturyLink or AT&T is the established local telephone company and our primary competitor. The remainder of our cable systems are in markets where we compete with various other companies. Our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by LFAs, and these franchises are typically non-exclusive. Accordingly, LFAs can grant additional franchises to our competitors and create competition in our markets where none existed previously, resulting in overbuilds. In some cases, the FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. Although as a general matter Internet service providers have upgraded their data networks to enable faster upload and download speeds for their customers in metropolitan markets before upgrading their data networks in our markets, CenturyLink, AT&T (through its U-verse brand) and other companies have overbuilt approximately 28% of our homes passed with fiber-to-the-node or other high-speed networks, such that they are able to offer data, video and voice services, including data services with high access speeds, albeit generally lower when compared to those that we offer. Further overbuilding could cause more of our customers to purchase data and video services from our competitors instead of from us. In our other markets, some of our telephone company competitors have entered into strategic partnerships or other arrangements with DBS operators that permit these telephone companies to package the video services of DBS operators with their own DSL, landline voice and wireless voice services. An example of such arrangement is the merger of AT&T and DirecTV. We also face increasing competition for residential voice services from wireless telephone companies, as some of our customers are replacing our landline voice service completely with wireless voice service.\nIn addition, new entrants with significant financial resources may compete on a larger scale with our video and data services. For example, several years ago, Alphabet launched Google Fiber, which offers data and video services in several areas of the country. Google Fiber\u2019s infrastructure consists of fiber optic wirelines, which is technologically superior to the DSL technology of a number of our competitors. Given its financial resources, Alphabet may further expand into regions in which we compete, as well as prompt our competitors to continue to upgrade their own networks in order to be able to offer increased download and upload speeds necessary to remain competitive. Alphabet\u2019s size and financial resources may enable it to continue to upgrade its infrastructure. Although Alphabet announced in the fourth quarter of 2016 that it was pausing its Google Fiber expansion in most of its potential Google Fiber cities, if Alphabet expands its Google Fiber offerings into our markets, it may be able to offer our current customers attractive pricing and technology, increasing competition in our markets.\nA number of municipalities have also announced plans to construct their own data networks with access speeds that match or exceed those of our own through the use of fiber optic technology. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us without obtaining a franchise from an LFA, reducing their barriers to entry into our markets. The entrance of municipalities as competitors in our markets would add to the competition we face and could lead to additional customer attrition.\nOur video business also faces substantial and increasing competition from other forms of in-home entertainment and recreational activities, including video games, mobile apps and the Internet, as well as from other media companies. Internet and other media companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Sling TV, Hulu and Netflix, increasingly offer video programming via OTT streaming on the Internet. Because of the significant size and financial resources of such companies, we anticipate that they will continue to invest resources in increasing the availability of video content on the Internet, which may result in less demand for the video services we provide. In addition, companies that offer OTT content in certain markets also provide data services, such as Alphabet, and they may seek to increase sales of their streaming content by lowering the cost of data services for their customers, which would further increase price competition for the data services we offer. In addition to creating competition for our video services business, OTT content also significantly increases the volume of traffic on our data networks, which can lead to decreases in access speeds for all users if data networks are not upgraded so that their broadband capacity can keep pace with increased traffic. Any of these events could have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nOur business is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to technological changes and respond appropriately to changes in consumer demand, our competitive position may be harmed.\nOur success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers\u2019 changing demands and distinguish our services from those of our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. If we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to our customers than those chosen by our competitors, or if we offer services that fail to appeal to consumers, that are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our business and financial results could suffer.\nThe ability of some of our competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than we can may adversely affect our competitive position. Furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors\u2019 product and service offerings may require us in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer at no additional charge or at a lower price certain products and services that we currently offer to customers separately or at a premium.\nIn addition, we seek to leverage overall industry experience before rolling out new technology in order to avoid investing in technology that has not been proven successful in other markets. We implement this approach to avoid costly mistakes made by early adopters of new technology that does not provide expected returns, and it exposes us to the risk that one of our competitors will adopt successful new technology before us, and leverage this new technology to attract our customers, increasing the level of customer attrition we experience and adversely affecting our business.\nBusiness services sales increasingly contribute to our results of operations, and we face risks as we attempt to further focus on sales to our business customers.\nGrowth in revenue from sales to our business customers has exceeded 13% for each year since we started focusing on business services sales in 2011, and we may encounter challenges as we continue our initiative to expand sales of data, voice and video services to our business customers. To accommodate this expansion, we expect to commit a greater proportion of our expenditures on technology, equipment and personnel focused on our business customers. If we are unable to sufficiently maintain the necessary infrastructure and internal support functions necessary to service these customers, potential future growth of our business services revenues would be limited. In many cases, business customers have service level agreements that require us to provide higher standards of service and reliability. If we are unable to meet these service level requirements, or more broadly, the expectations of our business customers, we would no longer expect business sales to increase and our results of operations may be materially negatively affected.\nThe increase in programming costs and retransmission fees may continue in the future, resulting in lower margins than we anticipate.\nOver the past few years, the sales margins on our residential video services, which accounted for 36.0%, 41.2% and 44.4% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, have decreased as a result of increased programming costs and retransmission fees and customer cord-cutting. Programming costs and retransmission fees paid to major programmers may continue to increase as programmers are expected to ask for higher fees. Moreover, programming cost increases have caused us, and may in the future cause us, to cease carrying channels offered by certain programmers, which may result in attrition of video subscribers as well as customers who subscribe to double-play or triple-play packages that include video service. These customer losses and increased costs could result in further decreases in our residential video margins and adversely impact our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware and software necessary to provide some of our services, including our access to the network backbone and the set-top boxes and modems that we lease to our customers. Some of these vendors represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, demand exceeds these vendors\u2019 capacity, they experience operating or financial difficulties, they significantly increase the amount we pay for necessary products or services or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability, a change in their ownership or otherwise, our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract subscribers and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nWe may make acquisitions, which could involve inherent risks and uncertainties.\nWe may make acquisitions, which could involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u25cf\nthe challenge in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nthe potential diversion of senior management\u2019s attention from our ongoing operations;\n\u25cf\nthe risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to incorporate the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\npotential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf\nin some cases, the potential for increased regulation.\nIf an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business or one or more of the other risks and uncertainties identified above occur in connection with our acquisitions, our operations, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially negatively affected.\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. economy could impact our results of operations.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the United States may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our residential and business customers that are unable to pay for services. Such conditions could also inhibit or prevent our third-party suppliers and licensors from supplying some of the hardware and software necessary to provide some of our services. If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material negative effect on our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, \u201ccyber attacks,\u201d misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist attacks, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our business.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies are critical to our operating activities, both to internal uses and in supplying data, video and voice services to customers. Network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, \u201ccyber attacks,\u201d process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks. Both unsuccessful and successful \u201ccyber attacks\u201d on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years and, because the techniques used in such attacks have become more sophisticated and change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. From time to time third parties make malicious attempts to access our network. Any successful attempts could result in an unauthorized release of information, degradation to our network and information systems or disruption to our data, video and voice services, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term weather patterns or any long-term changes), terrorist attacks and similar events. For example, the damage to our network infrastructure caused by Hurricane Katrina and the Joplin, Missouri tornado each created a significant disruption in our ability to provide services in affected areas. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers in the future, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our plant, equipment, data and reputation. Such an event also could result in large expenditures necessary to repair or replace such networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Further, the impacts associated with extreme weather or any long-term changes, such as intensified storm activity, may cause increased business interruptions.\nFurthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. We provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our business, and there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any such compromise could require us to implement costly remediation measures.\nVarious U.S. Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. This area of the law is evolving, and interpretations of applicable laws and regulations differ. Legislative and regulatory activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are relevant to our operations, for example, use of consumer data for marketing or advertising. Claims of failure to comply with our privacy policies or applicable laws or regulations could form the basis of governmental or private-party actions against us. Such claims and actions may cause damage to our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIntellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent us from using necessary technology to provide our services or subject us to expensive intellectual property litigation.\nWe periodically receive claims from third parties alleging that our network and information technology infrastructure infringes the intellectual property rights of others. We are generally named as joint defendants in these suits together with other providers of data, video and voice services. Typically these claims allege that aspects of our cable system architecture, electronic program guides, cable modem technology and VoIP services infringe on process patents held by third parties. It is likely that we will continue to be subject to similar claims as they relate to our cable business. Addressing these claims is a time-consuming and expensive endeavor, regardless of the merits of the claims. In order to resolve such a claim, we could determine the need to change our method of doing business, enter into a licensing agreement or incur substantial monetary liability. It is also possible that our business could be enjoined from using the intellectual property at issue, causing us to significantly alter our operations. If any such claims are successful, then the outcome would likely affect our services utilizing the intellectual property at issue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. The competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry could adversely impact our ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.\nRisks Relating to Regulation and Legislation\nThe profitability of our data services offerings may be impacted by legislative or regulatory efforts to impose \u201cnet-neutrality\u201d and other new requirements on cable operators.\nThe majority of our current Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures comes from residential data services, and we expect that a majority of our residential customers will be data-only in the future. We have aligned our resources to emphasize increased sales of data services, as well as sales to business customers. In order to continue to generate Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures at our desired level from data services, we need the continued flexibility to develop and refine business models that respond to changing consumer uses and demands and to manage data usage efficiently, including by charging our data subscribers higher rates based on the overall bandwidth capacity available to, or used by, them, referred to as \u201cusage-based billing.\u201d Our ability to implement usage-based billing or other network management initiatives in the future may be restricted by the FCC\u2019s \u201cnet-neutrality\u201d requirements on cable operators.\nTo the extent the FCC in the future limits our ability to price our data services, we may not be able to generate the margins on our data services that we anticipated in shifting our focus from video to data services, and our business could be materially negatively impacted. While the FCC forbore from requirements that would require cable companies to contribute a portion of their revenues from data services to the USF, the FCC also ruled that it may revisit this determination in the future. Current rules only require that a portion of revenues from VoIP services be contributed to the USF. The changes brought about by how USF monies are distributed may provide funding and subsidies to those who either compete with us or seek to compete with us and therefore put us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, if the FCC imposes USF fees on broadband services, bundled services or a larger portion of VoIP services, it would increase the cost of our services and harm our ability to compete.\nGiven that the scope of the FCC\u2019s network neutrality regulations is not fully defined and given that the rules create procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations, it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities, which could lead to yet further regulation. It also is possible that the FCC\u2019s network neutrality regulations will be reduced or eliminated entirely as a result of the new administration and the newly-constituted FCC. The regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to profit from our existing broadband network and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks. We cannot predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business.\nOur video and voice services are subject to additional regulation by U.S. Federal, state and local authorities, which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\nOur video services business operates in a highly regulated environment. Our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by LFAs controlling the public rights-of-way, which typically are non-exclusive and limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a percentage of revenues. Failure to comply with all of the terms and conditions of a franchise may give rise to rights of termination by the franchising authority.\nWe have the ability, pursuant to the Copyright Act, under certain terms and conditions, to retransmit the signals of television stations pursuant to a compulsory copyright license. From time to time, revisions to the cable compulsory copyright rules are considered. It is possible that changes in the rules or copyright compulsory license fee computations or compliance procedures could have an adverse effect on our business by, for example, increasing copyright compulsory license fee costs or by causing us to reduce or discontinue carriage of certain broadcast signals that we currently carry on a discretionary basis.\nIn addition, Congress, the FCC and other government agencies have implemented regulations that affect the types of set-top boxes that we can lease or deploy to our subscribers, and we expect these regulations to change in the future. Most recently, in January 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy tentatively designated set-top boxes and network equipment as covered consumer products and proposed to adopt a new test procedure for set-top boxes as part of its Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products and Certain Commercial and Industry Equipment. In December 2013, the Department of Energy withdrew its proposed rules to designate set-top boxes and network equipment as a covered product and to establish a test procedure for set-top boxes, but stated that it would consider reinitiating the rulemaking. Imposing energy conservation regulations on the hardware products we provide to our customers could impede innovation and require mandatory upgrades in our set-top boxes and be costly to us. In February 2016, the FCC announced a notice of proposed rulemaking that would allow any manufacturer to create cable boxes that can access pay-TV services so that consumers are not required to lease set-top boxes from cable and satellite providers, but the newly-constituted FCC has removed this item from review by the FCC for now. We cannot predict when, whether or to what extent any of these proposals will be resolved or how they will affect our operations.\nOur voice services business is also subject to a growing degree of regulation. Complying with these regulations may increase the costs we incur and decrease the revenues we derive from our voice business. While the compliance costs associated with the current regulatory structure applicable to our voice services business are manageable, changes in this regulatory structure are unpredictable and have the potential to further negatively impact our voice services business by increasing compliance costs and/or taxes.\nOur cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more markets could adversely affect our business.\nMany of the LFAs from whom we have obtained franchises, permits and similar authorizations required to operate our video services business have established comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, our franchises are terminable if we fail to comply with significant provisions set forth in the applicable franchise agreement governing our video operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. LFAs may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. LFAs often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. The traditional cable franchising regime has recently undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. Some state franchising laws do not allow us to immediately opt into favorable statewide franchising. In many cases, state franchising laws will result in fewer franchise imposed requirements for our competitors who are new entrants than for us, until we are able to opt into the applicable state franchise. We cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more markets could materially negatively affect our business in the affected geographic area.\nIn addition, certain of our franchise agreements require that the applicable LFA approve a transfer of control of our Company. Although FCC rules provide that a transfer application shall be deemed granted if it is not acted upon within a 120 days after submission, as a practical matter, cable operators often waive the deadline if the LFA has not completed its review to facilitate discussions and thereby avoid an LFA denying the transfer of control. Failure to obtain such consents on commercially reasonable and satisfactory terms may impair our entitlement to the benefit of these franchise agreements in the future and could materially negatively affect our business.\nWe may encounter increased pole attachment costs.\nUnder U.S. Federal law, we have the right to attach cables carrying video and other services to telephone and similar poles and underground conduits owned by utility companies. In addition, U.S. Federal law requires most telephone and power utilities to charge reasonable rates to cable operators for utilizing space on utility poles or in underground conduits in order to transmit video services to customers. However, because these cables may carry services other than video services, such as voice services, some utility pole owners have sought to impose on cable companies a telecommunications rate for utilizing pole space for voice services, which is higher than the statutory rate charged to cable operators for video services. In May 2010 and again in April 2011, the FCC adopted new requirements relating to pole access and construction practices that were expected to improve the ability of cable operators to attach to utility poles on a timely basis and to lower the pole attachment rate for voice services. In October 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a lower court\u2019s decision to uphold the FCC\u2019s pole attachment regulations. The FCC further revised its pole attachment rules in November 2015 to adjust the formula for calculating pole rental rates, which resulted in similar rates for telecommunications attachments and cable attachments, and eliminated the ability of utility companies to justify higher rates for pole attachments used to provide broadband Internet access service. Those rules are being challenged in a U.S. Federal court by the utility companies, where the matter is pending. In the meantime, the appropriate method for calculating pole attachment rates for cable operators that provide VoIP services remains unclear, although the FCC\u2019s recent rule revisions to equalize pole attachment rates make this issue less significant. We cannot predict the extent to which regulatory changes may affect our ability over time to secure timely access to poles at reasonable rates for our data, voice and video services. As a general matter, changes to our pole attachment rate structure could significantly increase our annual pole attachment costs and materially negatively impact our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLFAs have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on our business, which could further increase our expenses.\nIn addition to the franchise agreement, LFAs in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems, and the services we provide in the jurisdiction. This additional regulation increases the cost of operating our business. LFAs may impose new and more restrictive requirements. LFAs who are certified to regulate rates in their communities generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic video service and equipment.\nChanges in broadcast carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs.\nAlthough we would likely choose to carry all primary video feeds of local broadcast stations in the markets in which we operate voluntarily, so-called \u201cmust carry\u201d rules could, in the future, require us to carry some local broadcast television signals on some of our cable systems that we might not otherwise carry. If the FCC seeks to revise or expand the \u201cmust carry\u201d rules, such as to require carriage of multicast streams, we would be forced to carry video programming that we would not otherwise carry and potentially drop other, more popular programming in order to free capacity for the required programming, which could make us less competitive. Moreover, if the FCC adopts rules that are not competitively neutral, cable operators could be placed at a disadvantage versus other video providers. Any of these events could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Spin-Off from GHC\nThe spin-off could result in significant tax liability to GHC and its stockholders, and we could have an indemnification obligation to GHC if the Distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition treatment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nCompletion of the spin-off required GHC\u2019s receipt of a written opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP to the effect that the Distribution should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nThe opinion of counsel did not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the spin-off. The opinion assumed that the spin-off was completed according to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement with GHC and relied on the facts as stated in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the other ancillary agreements, the Information Statement included in our registration statement on Form 10 and a number of other documents. In addition, the opinion was based on certain representations as to factual matters from GHC, us and Donald E. Graham. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect.\nThe opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. GHC has not requested, and does not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the spin-off.\nIf the Distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, \u201cU.S. Holders\u201d (defined as a beneficial owner of GHC common stock that is a United States person for purposes of the Code) could be subject to tax. In this case, each U.S. Holder who received our common stock in the Distribution would generally be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received, which would generally result in (1) a taxable dividend to the U.S. Holder to the extent of that U.S. Holder\u2019s pro rata share of GHC\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits; (2) a reduction in the U.S. Holder\u2019s basis (but not below zero) in GHC common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder\u2019s share of GHC\u2019s earnings and profits; and (3) a taxable gain from the exchange of GHC common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the U.S. Holder\u2019s share of GHC\u2019s earnings and profits and the U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in its GHC common stock.\nIf, due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, it were determined that the Distribution did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Code, we could be required to indemnify GHC for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn addition, Section 355(e) of the Code generally creates a presumption that the Distribution would be taxable to GHC, but not to stockholders, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Distribution, unless it were established that such transactions and the Distribution were not part of a plan or series of related transactions giving effect to such a change in ownership. If the Distribution were taxable to GHC due to such a 50% or greater change in ownership of our stock, GHC would recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock distributed to GHC stockholders over GHC\u2019s tax basis in our common stock and we generally would be required to indemnify GHC for the tax on such gain and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Distribution, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355 of the Code. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nWe have limited operating history as an independent, publicly traded company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nOur historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods prior to the spin-off, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u25cf\nPrior to the spin-off, we operated as part of GHC\u2019s broader corporate organization and GHC performed various corporate functions for us, including finance, human resources, legal, information technology, general insurance, risk management and other corporate functions. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from GHC for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as an independent, publicly traded company.\n\u25cf\nWe entered into transactions with GHC that did not exist prior to the spin-off, such as GHC\u2019s provision of transition services, which caused and may continue to cause us to incur new costs.\n\u25cf\nOur historical financial information does not reflect all changes that we expect to experience in the future as a result of our separation from GHC, including changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, tax structure, financing and business operations. As part of GHC, we enjoyed certain benefits from GHC\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power, borrowing leverage and available capital for investments, and we have lost those benefits after the spin-off. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses, or access capital markets on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of GHC prior to the spin-off.\nFollowing the spin-off, we are responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent, publicly traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. For example, we are now required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm as to whether we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the last day of the year. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with GHC.\nWe have entered into agreements with GHC related to our separation from GHC, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Employee Matters Agreement, while we were still part of GHC. Accordingly, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. The terms of these agreements relate to, among other things, allocations of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between GHC and us. We may have received better terms from third parties.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe incurred indebtedness in connection with the spin-off, and the degree to which we are now leveraged may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we incurred indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $550 million, of which $450 million was distributed to GHC prior to the consummation of the spin-off. We historically relied upon GHC for working capital and other cash requirements, including in connection with our previous acquisitions. We are no longer able to rely on the earnings, assets or cash flow of GHC, and GHC will not provide funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. We are responsible for servicing our own debt, and obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements. Our access to and cost of debt financing may be different from our historical access to and cost of debt financing under GHC. Differences in access to and cost of debt financing may result in differences in the interest rate charged to us on financings, as well as the amount of indebtedness, types of financing structures and debt markets that may be available to us now that we are an independent, publicly traded company.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the spin-off, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restricts our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe terms of our indebtedness include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These may restrict our ability to take some or all of the following actions:\n\u25cf\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u25cf\npay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u25cf\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u25cf\ncreate liens;\n\u25cf\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u25cf\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u25cf\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u25cf\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nprepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nissue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and/or\n\u25cf\nsignificantly change the nature of our business.\nAs a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u25cf\nlimited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy;\n\u25cf\nunable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u25cf\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nA breach of any of these covenants, if applicable, could result in an event of default under the terms of our indebtedness. If an event of default occurs, the lenders would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt and the event of default or acceleration may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other of our debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. Furthermore, the lenders of this indebtedness may require that we pledge our assets as collateral as security for our repayment obligations. If we were unable to repay any amount of this indebtedness when due and payable, the lenders could proceed against the collateral that secures this indebtedness. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness and our financial condition will be materially negatively affected.\nWe have variable rate indebtedness that subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nAs of the end of 2016, we had $95.0 million of outstanding term loans and an additional $197.2 million of undrawn revolving credit facilities with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. In addition, we will be exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with short-term or variable-rate borrowings. Even if we enter into interest rate swaps in the future in order to reduce future interest rate volatility, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to our variable rate indebtedness, if any, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. As a result, our financial condition could be materially negatively affected.\nOur ability to incur future indebtedness, whether for general corporate purposes or for acquisitions and strategic investments, may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes or for acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. For example, we expect to finance the acquisition of NewWave with $650 million of senior secured loans and cash on hand. In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on January 17, 2017, as amended and restated on February 13, 2017, with the Lenders. Pursuant to the amended and restated commitment letter, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Lenders have committed to provide us with $300 million of incremental five-year term \u201cA\u201d loans and $350 million of incremental seven-year term \u201cB\u201d loans to finance the transaction.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all, including because of the terms of our current indebtedness. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our future activities, which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u25cf\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u25cf\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or maintain coverage of, our common stock;\n\u25cf\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u25cf\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u25cf\ninvestor perception of our Company and the cable industry;\n\u25cf\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nLow trading volume for our stock, which may occur if an active trading market is not sustained, among other reasons, would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock price volatility.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders falls within the discretion of our Board. Our Board\u2019s decisions regarding the amount and payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business and covenants associated with debt obligations, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividend in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in our Company may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in our Company may be diluted in the future because of equity awards granted, and that we expect to grant in the future, to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future or as necessary to finance our ongoing operations.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership of our common stock will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that is opposed by our Board or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock. These include provisions that:\n\u25cf\ndivide our Board into three classes of directors, standing for election on a staggered basis, such that only approximately one-third of the directors constituting our Board may change each year;\n\u25cf\ndo not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nprovide that only our Chief Executive Officer and a majority of our directors, and not our stockholders, may call a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nrequire the approval of our Board or the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 66 2\u20443% of the voting power of our capital stock to amend our Amended and Restated By-laws; and\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to enter into business combination transactions with certain stockholders.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of our Company, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.", "PERMNO": 15395, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "CABO"}
