{"cik": "1046327", "company": "REALNETWORKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results, and the trading price of our common stock, could be materially harmed.\nOur growth initiatives could take longer than planned, be unsuccessful, or deplete our cash resources, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the performance of our businesses and financial results, and could cause us to pursue additional debt or other funding sources.\nIn recent years, we have developed new products and technologies, and funded initiatives, intended to create growth in our businesses, while simultaneously taking steps to reduce costs and increase profitability. These growth initiatives, several of which have been unsuccessful over recent years, have impacted all segments of our organization, requiring us to allocate limited resources among our diverse business units. Our financial sustainability is largely dependent on the success of our growth initiatives, and there are many risks to that success, some of which are internal to our company, including our ability to develop and monetize our products and services, and some of which are externally driven and outside of our control, such as the potential impact of macroeconomic pressures and global pandemics. In particular, we expect that progress with our growth initiatives will be negatively impacted by various reactions to the recent global outbreak of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, community lockdowns, tightening of corporate budgets, reduction in consumer confidence, and significant instability in financial markets. We cannot predict the duration or severity of these reactions or impacts to our business and, if prolonged, our cash reserves may prove insufficient, requiring us to pursue additional debt or other funding sources.\nGiven the ambitious and significant nature of our growth initiatives, there is substantial risk that we may be unsuccessful in implementing our plans in a timely manner, our cash reserves may be depleted or insufficient to fully implement our plans, our growth initiatives may not gain adequate momentum, or the combination of our growth initiatives and cost reductions may not prove to be profitable. In any such case, our business would suffer, and our operational and financial results would be negatively impacted to a significant degree.\nIn August 2019, RealNetworks and Napster entered into a loan agreement with a third-party financial institution. Under the terms of that agreement, the bank extended a revolving line of credit not to exceed $10.0 million in the aggregate. The loan agreement contains customary covenants, including financial covenants, minimum EBITDA levels, and maintaining an unrestricted cash balance of $3.5 million. We have not had a debt facility in place in our recent past, therefore the entry into this facility introduces new risks to the company, including the risk that constraints around covenants may lead to less flexibility in operational decision making, the risk of default and various implications thereof, and the potential increase in liabilities on our balance sheet in the event that we draw down the line of credit.\nThe inability to obtain additional debt, whether through draws on our current line of credit or through a new debt facility, or the raising of funds through other means, could negatively impact our going concern assessment or our governance structure in the future. The occurrence of these or any of the risks described above would impair our financial results and stock price.\nOur 84% equity interest in Napster could result in material negative implications to our financial condition and stock price.\nFrom March 31, 2010, when we completed the restructuring of our digital audio music service joint venture, Rhapsody America LLC, now doing business under the Napster brand, until January 18, 2019, we did not have a majority voting interest in Napster. During that period, we accounted for Napster using the equity method of accounting and disclosed only strategic, business and financial information regarding Napster in our financial statements and disclosures, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Historically, Napster generated significant accounting losses and, applying the equity method of accounting, we recognized our share of such losses on our investment. As we had no implicit or explicit commitment to provide future financial support to Napster, we did not record any further share of Napster losses that would reduce our carrying value of Napster below zero.\nOn January 18, 2019, we acquired an additional 42% of the outstanding equity of Rhapsody International, Inc., which we refer to as Napster as noted above, from a third party in a distressed sale resulting in our ownership of an aggregate of 84% of Napster's outstanding stock. See Note 4. Acquisitions, for additional information. We also now have the right to nominate directors constituting a majority of the Napster board of directors, however, Napster will continue to operate as an independent business with its own board of directors, strategy, and leadership team. Accordingly, although we have no legal or constructive obligation to fund Napster losses and it is our intention to have Napster continue to operate as an independent company, RealNetworks has in the past extended loans to Napster and may do so in the future.\nDue to our majority voting interest and the consolidation of Napster's results and financial position with ours, Napster's current liabilities are included in RealNetworks' consolidated balance sheet, including accrued but unbilled music royalties related to past services, the ultimate payment of which is uncertain. These liabilities, although not a legal or constructive obligation of RealNetworks, result in consolidated working capital being negative, which causes management to consider whether liquidity risks exist. While we believe that these liabilities are separate obligations of Napster and RealNetworks assumes no responsibility for these liabilities, in the remote event that any such liquidity issues become significant or are deemed material to our consolidated financial statements, there could be material negative implications to our financial condition and the trading price of our stock.\nAs discussed in Note 4. Acquisitions, under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities, as well as the contingent consideration and noncontrolling interests, all involve the application of judgments and estimates, including but not limited to, estimation of expected future cash flows and related discount rates. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we finalized and recorded purchase price allocation adjustments that reflect new information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of the acquisition. These adjustments did not have a material effect on current or prior period consolidated financial statements.\nAlso due to the acquisition of the controlling interest in Napster, beginning with the first quarter of 2019 we consolidate Napster\u2019s financial results into the RealNetworks financial statements. Accordingly, we must receive Napster\u2019s quarterly financial statements and related information in a timely manner in order to prepare our quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K. Any failure in receiving Napster's financial statements and related information in a timely and materially accurate manner could cause our reports to be filed in an untimely and/or inaccurate manner, which would preclude us from utilizing certain registration statements and could negatively impact our stock price. See Note 4. Acquisitions, for further information related to Napster.\nWe need to successfully monetize our new products and services in order to sustain and grow our businesses, and manage our constrained cash resources.\nIn order to sustain our current level of business and to implement our growth initiatives, we must successfully monetize our new products and services, including through existing and new relationships with distribution partners. Our digital media products and services must be attractive and useful to distribution partners and end users. The successful acceptance and monetization of these products and services, therefore, is subject to unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including end-user preferences, competing products and services, the rapid pace of change in the market, the effectiveness of our distribution channels, and significant global crises. Any failure by us to timely and accurately anticipate consumers\u2019 changing needs and preferences, emerging technological trends and data privacy norms, or changes in the competitive or regulatory landscape for our products and services could result in a failure to monetize our new products or the loss of market opportunities, both of which we have experienced at various times in our past.\nMoreover, in order to grow our new businesses, we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether the products and services that we are developing or have introduced will meet the demands of the relevant market. As we have experienced, we may not realize a sufficient return, or may experience losses, on these investments, thereby further straining our limited cash resources and negatively affecting our ability to pursue other needed growth or strategic opportunities.\nSustaining and growing our businesses, and managing our constrained cash resources, are subject to these risks inherent in developing, distributing and monetizing our new products and services. Our failure to manage these risks could further impair our operations and financial results to a material degree, and could cause an unsustainable depletion of our cash resources.\nFurthermore, our products and services have been in the past and may be in the future subject to legal challenge. Responding to any such claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop distributing or selling, or to redesign our products or services, or to pay damages, any of which could constrain our growth plans and cash resources.\nOur businesses, including in connection with our growth initiatives, face substantial competitive challenges that may impair our success, thus negatively impacting our future growth.\nOur digital media products and services, including legacy and products/services central to our growth initiatives, face a wide variety of competitors, many of which have longer operating histories, greater name or brand recognition, deeper and more expansive market penetration, more employees, and significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, current and potential competitors may include relatively new businesses that develop or use innovative technologies, products or features that could disrupt the market for technologies, products or features we currently or are seeking to develop and market. In attempting to compete with any or all of these competitors, we may experience, as we have in the past, some or all of the following consequences, any of which would adversely affect our operating results and the trading price of our stock:\n\u2022reduced prices or margins;\n\u2022loss of current and potential customers, or partners and potential partners who distribute our products and services or who provide content that we distribute to our customers;\n\u2022changes to our products, services, technologies, licenses or business practices or strategies;\n\u2022lengthened sales cycles;\n\u2022inability to meet demands for more rapid sales or development cycles;\n\u2022industry-wide changes in content distribution to customers or in trends in consumer consumption of digital media products and services;\n\u2022pressure to prematurely release products or product enhancements; or\n\u2022degradation in our stature or reputation in the market.\nOur Consumer Media technologies for media playback and production (RealPlayer, RealMedia VB and RealMedia HD) compete with alternative media playback technologies and audio and video content formats that have obtained broad market penetration. RealMedia VB and RealMedia HD are codecs, technology that enables compression and decompression of the media content in a (usually proprietary) format. We license our codec technology primarily to computer, smartphone and other mobile device manufacturers, and also to other partners that can support our efforts to build a strong ecosystem, like content providers and integrated circuit developers. To compete effectively, codec technologies must appeal to, and be adopted for use by, a wide range of parties: producers and providers of media content, consumers of media content, and device manufacturers who pre-load codec technologies onto their devices. Our ability to sustain or grow this business, which has recently experienced some downward pressure, is dependent on the successful promotion and adoption of our codec technologies to a wide and diverse target market, which is a complex and highly uncertain undertaking. If we are unable to compete successfully, our Consumer Media business could decline as it has in the recent past or on a more accelerated basis.\nThe market for our Mobile Services business is highly competitive and continues to rapidly evolve. Our SaaS services face competition from a proliferation of applications and services, many of which carriers can deploy or offer to their subscribers, or which consumers can acquire independently of their carrier. We expect pricing pressure in this business to continue to materially impact our operating results in this business. We also compete with a wide variety of companies, as small startups and well established, heavily resourced global companies continue to develop technologies and launch products in the facial recognition market. The success of this newly launched business is highly dependent on our ability to differentiate our product offering within this competitive environment.\nThe branded services in our Games business compete with other developers, aggregators and distributors of mobile, online, and downloadable games. Our competitors vary in size and capabilities, some of which have high volume distribution channels and greater financial resources than we do; while others may be smaller and more able to quickly or efficiently adjust to market conditions. We also face significant price competition in the casual games market, and some of our competitors may be able to offer games for free, or reduce prices more aggressively. We expect competition to continue to intensify in this market. Our games development studios compete primarily with other developers of mobile, online, and downloadable games, and must continue to develop popular and high-quality game titles. Our Games business must also continue to execute on opportunities to expand the play of our games on a variety of non-PC platforms, including mobile, in order to maintain our competitive position and to grow the business. Moreover, continued growth in our Games business is in part dependent on the availability of funds to invest in marketing, which availability cannot be assured.\nThe distribution and license of our technology products and services are governed by contracts with third parties, the terms of which subject us to significant risks that could negatively impact our revenue, expenses and assumption of liability related to such contracts.\nIn our Consumer Media and Mobile Services segments, we distribute and license most of our technology products and services pursuant to contracts with third parties, such as mobile carriers and their partners, online service providers, and OEMs and device manufacturers, many of whom may have stronger negotiating leverage due to their size and reach. These contracts govern the calculation of revenue generated and expenses incurred, how we recognize revenue and expenses in our financial statements, and the allocation of risk and liabilities arising from the product or service or distribution thereof. Terms impacting revenue, over which we may have limited if any control, may involve revenue sharing arrangements, end user pricing, usage levels, and exclusivity, all of which significantly affect the level of revenue that we may realize from the relationship.\nMoreover, contract terms around marketing and promotion of our products and other expense allocation could result in us bearing higher expenses or achieving weaker performance than we had anticipated from the relationship.\nIn addition, although our contracts with third parties are typically for a fixed duration, they could be terminated early; and they may be renegotiated on less favorable terms or may not be renewed at all by the other party. We must, therefore, seek additional contracts with third parties on an ongoing basis to sustain and grow our business. We expect to face continuing and increased competition for the technology products and services we provide, and there is no assurance that the parties with which we currently have contracts will continue or extend current contracts on the same or more favorable terms, or that we will obtain alternative or additional contracts for our technology products and services. As we have recently experienced in our China business, the further loss of existing contracts, the failure to enter new contracts, or the deterioration of customer creditworthiness or the terms in our contracts with third parties could materially harm our operating results, financial condition, and cash flow.\nNearly all of our contracts in which we provide to another party services or rights to use our technology include some form of obligation by us to indemnify the other party for certain liabilities and losses incurred by them, including liabilities resulting from third party claims for damages that arise out of the use of our technology. These indemnification terms provide us with certain procedural safeguards, including the right to control the defense of the indemnified party. We have in the past incurred costs to defend and settle such claims. Claims against which we may be obligated to defend others pursuant to our contracts could in the future result in payments that could materially harm our business and financial results.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, which may contribute to continued weakness in our stock price, which could, in turn, jeopardize our ability to comply with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements threatening the continued listing of our common stock.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been steadily declining. In addition, as a result of the rapidly changing markets in which we compete, and restructuring, impairment and other one-time events specific to us, our operating results may fluctuate or continue to decline from period to period, which may contribute to continued weakness or volatility of our stock price. Moreover, the general difficulty in forecasting our operating results and identifying meaningful performance metrics, especially when factoring in our growth initiatives, could result in actual results that differ materially from expected results, again causing continued weakness and volatility in our stock price. Compounding these internal factors, external factors such as the significant recent instability in global financial markets caused in part by a global pandemic, will impact our operating results and stock price, potentially driving our stock price to record lows.\nThe difficulty in forecasting our operating results may also cause over or under investment in certain growth initiatives, as such investment is often planned based on expected financial results, thus causing more severe fluctuations in operating results and, likely, further volatility in our stock price.\nFurther, because our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, we must meet Nasdaq's continued listing requirements, in particular, financial requirements that include maintaining a minimum bid price of at least $1.00. Although we are currently in compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and have received no contradictory notification from Nasdaq, the trading price of our common stock has recently closed at a price below the required minimum. Further dramatic declines in the stock market have recently and may continue to cause declines in the price of our common stock. We regularly monitor our compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements, and, as necessary, our Board will consider the implementation of various measures intended to support continued compliance.\nAny impairment to our goodwill and definite-lived assets could result in a material charge to our earnings.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis or more frequently in the event of certain indications of possible impairment. We review definite-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit\u2019s fair value, changes in our operating plans and forecasts, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, a significant sustained decline in our market capitalization and other factors. If we were to determine that an impairment had occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material negative, and unanticipated, impact on our financial results. We have recorded goodwill and definite-lived intangibles for the acquisition of Napster that totaled $69.2 million. See Note 4. Acquisitions, for further information related to Napster. The total carrying value of our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 was $81.7 million. Continued significant financial distress at Napster would likely have negative implications in our assessment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets on RealNetworks' balance sheet.\nContinued loss of revenue from our subscription services is likely to cause further harm to our operating results.\nOur operating results have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the loss of subscription revenue related to our more traditional products and services. Subscribers cancel their subscriptions to our services for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the services sufficiently or that the service does not provide enough value, a lack of attractive or exclusive content generally or as compared with competitive service offerings, or because customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Revenue from our SuperPass subscription service, for example, has continued to decline over several periods, due to changes in consumer preferences and changes on our part to focus on other products and services we offer, and we expect this trend to continue.\nGiven our declining revenue and operating losses, compounded by the coronavirus pandemic and related impacts to global financial markets, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs further discussed in Part II, Item 8, \u201cNote 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to our history of declining revenue and operating losses, as well as our near-term expectations of net negative cash flows from operating activities, compounded by the coronavirus pandemic and severe impacts to global financial markets, management has concluded that substantial doubt is deemed to exist about the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to improve cash flow by implementing some combination of the following: reduce operating expenses; improve working capital; defer certain obligations where we believe we have the legal basis to do so; draw upon our line of credit; sell businesses, product lines or assets; effectuate strategic alliances; or obtain outside investment. Further, we must successfully complete the process currently underway with our lender of negotiating customary covenants for 2020. Our limited cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price, inhibit our ability to obtain outside investment or strategic alliances.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, facial recognition technology, and other related technologies is evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are subject to regulations and laws specific to the marketing, sale and delivery of goods and services. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, user privacy, data collection and protection, copyrights, electronic contracts, sales procedures, automatic subscription renewals, credit card processing procedures, consumer protections, digital games distribution, broadband Internet access and content restrictions. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction, as it is not entirely clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as privacy, taxation and consumer protection apply or will be enforced with respect to the products and services we sell. Moreover, as Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation and/or enforcement efforts by federal, state and foreign agencies and the prospects for private litigation claims related to our data collection, privacy policies or other e-commerce practices become more likely. In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations or the imposition of other legal requirements that adversely affect our ability to market, sell, and deliver our products and services could decrease our ability to offer or customer demand for our service offerings, resulting in lower revenue. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective in May 2018, created a variety of new compliance obligations, with significant penalties for noncompliance. Moreover, in the U.S., certain states have and more states may impose stricter privacy laws that may impact accepted business practices. We cannot provide assurance that the changes that we have adopted to our business practices will be compliant or that new compliance frameworks such as this will not have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIn addition, through the operation of our SAFR product, we are subject to regulations and laws generally and specifically applicable to the provision of facial recognition technology. New laws and regulations are under discussion and those that exist are untested, thus we cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Moreover, the voluntary development of norms, standards, and best practices by companies providing facial recognition and similar technology could require modifications to our technology or practices that may be costly or incompatible with our financial model.\nFuture regulations, or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications, could require us to further change our business practices, raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business and result in additional historical or future liabilities for us, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and our operating results.\nAs a consumer-facing business, we receive complaints from our customers regarding our consumer marketing efforts and our customer service practices. Some of these customers may also complain to government agencies, and from time to time, those agencies have made inquiries to us about these practices. In addition, we may receive complaints or inquiries directly from governmental agencies that have not been prompted by consumers. We cannot provide assurance that governmental\nagencies will not bring future claims, as they have on occasion in the past, regarding our marketing, or consumer services or other practices.\nWe face financial and operational risks associated with doing business in non-U.S. jurisdictions and operating a global business, that have in the past and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA material portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the U.S. and most of our employees are located outside of the U.S. Consequently, our business and operations depend significantly on global and national economic conditions and on applicable trade regulations and tariffs. For example, our business in China could be negatively affected by an actual or perceived lack of stability or consistency in U.S.-China trade policy. The growth of our business is also dependent in part on successfully managing our international operations. Our non-U.S. sales, purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, many of which are outside our control, including the following:\n\u2022periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions;\n\u2022price and currency exchange controls;\n\u2022fluctuation in the relative values of currencies;\n\u2022difficulty in repatriating money, whether as a result of tax laws or otherwise;\n\u2022compliance with current and changing tax laws, and the coordination of compliance with U.S. tax laws and the laws of any of the jurisdictions in which we do business;\n\u2022difficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022compliance with labor laws and other laws governing employees;\n\u2022local labor disputes;\n\u2022changes in trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, or the termination or renegotiation of existing trade agreements;\n\u2022impact of changes in immigration or other policies impacting our ability to attract, hire, and retain key talent;\n\u2022potential implications resulting from the outbreak of disease on a global scale or localized in countries in which we do business or have employees; and\n\u2022difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, collecting accounts receivable, and managing suppliers, distributors and representatives.\nBecause consumers may consider the purchase of our digital entertainment products and services to be a discretionary expenditure, their decision whether to purchase our products and services may be influenced by macroeconomic factors that affect consumer spending such as unemployment, access to credit, negative financial news, and declines in income. In addition, mobile telecommunication carriers and other business partners may reduce their business or advertising spending with us or for our products and services they distribute to users in the face of adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as financial market volatility, government austerity programs, tight credit, and declines in asset values. We have in the past recorded material asset impairment charges due in part to weakness in the global economy, and we may need to record additional impairments to our assets in future periods in the event of renewed weakness and uncertainty in the global or a relevant national economy. Accordingly, any significant weakness in the national and/or global economy could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a negative manner.\nOur international operations involve risks inherent in doing business globally, including difficulties in managing operations due to distance, language, cultural differences, local economic conditions, outbreak of diseases, different or conflicting laws and regulations, taxes, and exchange rate fluctuations. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is typically the local currency of the country in which each subsidiary operates. We translate our subsidiaries\u2019 revenues into U.S. dollars in our financial statements, and continued volatility in foreign exchange rates, particularly if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro, may result in lower reported revenue or net assets in future periods. If we do not effectively manage any of the risks inherent in running our international businesses, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. As another example, the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has resulted in travel and work restrictions within China and globally, and may significantly disrupt our ability to produce and sell products. We are monitoring the impacts of the pandemic to our business, as well as rapidly evolving expectations regarding its severity and duration. We are unable to predict the full effects of this pandemic on our operations and financial results.\nOur business is conducted in accordance with existing international trade relationships, and trade laws and regulations. Changes in geopolitical relationships and laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, such as the recent rise in protectionist politics and economic nationalism, could create uncertainty regarding our ability to operate and conduct commercial relationships in affected jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or human-caused disasters. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nDifficulty recruiting and retaining key personnel could significantly impair our operations or jeopardize our ability to meet our growth objectives.\nOur success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of certain key personnel, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain them in the near term or recruit them in the future. Executive-level turnover, as we have experienced in the past and could experience in the future, could impact our ability to retain key personnel. Also, qualified individuals are in high demand and competition for such qualified personnel in our industry, particularly engineering talent, is extremely intense, and we may incur significant costs to attract or retain them. Changes in immigration or other policies in the U.S. or other jurisdictions that make it more difficult to hire and retain key talent, or to assign individuals to any of our locations as needed to meet business needs, could adversely affect our ability to attract key talent or deploy individuals as needed, and thereby adversely affect our business and financial results. Further, repeated restructuring of our businesses and related cost-reduction efforts, as well as declines in our stock price, have caused instability in our workforce that makes it more difficult to retain and recruit key personnel. Given these factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the key personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.\nThese risks also apply to our material subsidiaries, most notably Napster, which has experienced a high level of turnover in recent periods.\nAcquisitions and divestitures involve costs and risks that could harm our business and impair our ability to realize potential benefits from these transactions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired and sold technologies and businesses in the past and expect that we will continue to do so in the future.The failure to adequately manage transaction costs and address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by acquisitions and divestitures of technology and businesses could harm our business and prevent us from realizing the benefits of these transactions. In addition, we may identify and acquire target companies, but those companies may not be complementary to our current operations and may not leverage our existing infrastructure or operational experience, which may increase the risks associated with completing acquisitions.\nFor example, our January 18, 2019 acquisition of a controlling interest in Napster represents a significant acquisition for RealNetworks. We incurred significant transaction-related costs to effectuate the acquisition, which were recorded throughout fiscal year 2019, and we expect to record some additional costs in the first quarter of 2020. Furthermore, although Napster will continue to operate independently and its business will not be integrated into our businesses, we still face risks related to the acquisition such as the consolidation of Napster's financial results into our financial statements.\nTransaction-related costs and financial risks related to completed and potential future purchase or sale transactions may harm our financial position, reported operating results, or stock price. Previous acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased technology, amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets and the incurrence of charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are reflected in our operating expenses. New acquisitions and any potential additional future impairment of the value of purchased assets, including goodwill, could have a material negative impact on our future operating results. In compliance with GAAP, we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that our goodwill or definite-lived assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future revenue and cash flow estimates due to changes in our forecasts, and unfavorable changes to valuation multiples and discount rates due to changes in the market. If we were to conclude that any of these assets were impaired, we would have to recognize an impairment charge that could materially impact our financial results. With regard to Napster, the goodwill that we recorded in connection with the January 2019 acquisition could be deemed impaired in the event that Napster's cash position further deteriorates.\nPurchase and sale transactions also involve operational risks that could harm our existing operations or prevent realization of anticipated benefits from a transaction. These operational risks include:\n\u2022difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems, and/or personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022retaining key management or employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022entrance into unfamiliar markets, industry segments, or types of businesses;\n\u2022operating, managing and integrating acquired businesses in remote locations or in countries in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022diversion of management time and other resources from existing operations;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with employees, affiliates, advertisers or content providers of our business or acquired business;\n\u2022assumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired company, including intellectual property claims; and\n\u2022potential impacts to our system of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights or leverage our technology assets, and may face risks associated with third-party claims relating to intellectual property rights associated with our products and services.\nOur ability to compete across our businesses partly depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our technology, including both internally developed technology and technology licensed from third parties. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not assure our ownership rights in our intellectual property, protect or enhance the competitive position of our products, services and technology, or effectively prevent misappropriation of our technology.\nFrom time to time, we receive claims and inquiries from third parties alleging that our technology used in our business may infringe the third parties\u2019 proprietary rights. These claims, even if not meritorious, could force us to make significant investments of time, attention and money in defense, and give rise to monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. We may be forced to litigate, to enforce or defend our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the validity and scope of other parties' proprietary rights in intellectual property. To resolve or avoid such disputes, we may also be forced to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or redesign our product features, services and technology to avoid actual or claimed infringement or misappropriation of technology. Any such dispute would likely be costly and distract our management, and the outcome of any such dispute (such as additional licensing arrangements or redesign efforts) could fail to improve our business prospects or otherwise harm our business or financial results.\nNearly all of our contracts by which we provide to another party services or rights to use our technology include some form of obligation by us to indemnify the other party for certain liabilities and losses incurred by them, including liabilities resulting from third party claims for damages that arise out of the use of our technology. Also, in 2012 we sold most of our patents, including patents that covered streaming media, to Intel Corporation, in a contract by which we agreed to indemnify Intel Corporation for certain third-party infringement claims against these patents up to the purchase price we received in the sale. Claims against which we may be obligated to defend others pursuant to our contracts expose us to the same risks and adverse consequences described above regarding claims we may receive directly alleging that our trademarks or technology used in our business may infringe a third party's proprietary rights.\nDisputes regarding the validity and scope of patents or the ownership of technologies and rights associated with streaming media, digital distribution, and online businesses are common and likely to arise in the future. We also routinely receive challenges to our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property that we are using in our business activities. We are likely to continue to receive claims of third parties against us, alleging contract breaches, infringement of copyrights or patents, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy rights.\nOur business and operating results will suffer and we may be subject to market risk and legal liability if our systems or networks fail, become unavailable, unsecured or perform poorly so that current or potential users do not have adequate access to our products, services and websites.\nOur ability to provide our products and services to our customers and operate our business depends on the continued operation and security of our information systems and networks and those of our service providers. A significant or repeated reduction in the performance, security or availability of our information systems and network infrastructure or that of our service providers could harm our ability to conduct our business, and harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain users, customers, advertisers and content providers. Many of our products are interactive Internet applications that by their very nature require communication between a client and server to operate.\nWe sell many of our products and services through online sales transactions directly with consumers, and their credit card information is collected and stored by our payment processors. The systems of our third party service providers may not prevent future improper access or disclosure of credit card information or personally identifiable information. We have an extensive privacy policy concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data involved in interactions between our client, third party payment providers, and server products. A security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information, or any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or existing or new privacy legislation, could harm our reputation, impact the market for our products and services, or subject us to litigation. We have on occasion experienced system errors and failures that caused interruption in availability of products or content or an increase in response time. Problems with our systems and networks, or the third party systems and networks that we utilize, could result from a failure to adequately maintain and enhance these systems and networks, natural disasters and similar events, power failures, intentional actions to disrupt systems and networks and many other causes. Many of our services do not currently have fully redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan, and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage.\nChanges in regulations applicable to the Internet and e-commerce that increase the taxes on the services we provide could materially harm our business and operating results.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing taxation by state, local or foreign tax authorities becomes more likely. For example, taxation of electronically delivered products and services or other charges imposed by government\nagencies may also be imposed. We collect transactional taxes and we believe we are compliant and current in all jurisdictions where we have a collection obligation for transaction taxes. Any regulation imposing greater taxes or other fees for products and services could result in a decline in the sale of products and services and the viability of those products and services, harming our business and operating results. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign tax authorities that we should collect and remit sales or other taxes on the sale of our products or services could result in substantial liability for past sales.\nIn those countries where we have a tax obligation, we collect and remit value added tax, or VAT, on sales of \u201celectronically supplied services\u201d provided to European Union residents. The collection and remittance of VAT subjects us to additional currency fluctuation risks.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the SEC, and new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Moreover, our financial statements require the application of judgments and estimates regarding a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, the acquisition method of accounting and its related estimated fair value amounts, stock-based compensation, music publisher and royalty accruals, and intangible asset valuations. Changes in accounting standards or practices, or in our judgments and estimates underlying accounting standards and practices, could harm our operating results and/or financial condition. An example of a new accounting pronouncement is the new lease accounting guidance. As discussed in Note 2 and Note 17 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, this new guidance requires us to record lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, which previously were off-balance sheet obligations subject to disclosure but not recognition. Changes to existing accounting rules or to our judgments and estimates underlying those rules could materially impact our reported operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to additional income tax assessments and changes in applicable tax regulations could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, income taxes payable, and net deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical financial statements. An audit or litigation can result in significant additional income taxes payable in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owns 38.5% of our common stock, which gives him significant control over certain major decisions on which our shareholders may vote or which may discourage an acquisition of us.\nRobert Glaser, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns 38.5% of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Glaser and his affiliates will have significant influence to:\n\u2022elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u2022amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u2022control the outcome of any other matter submitted to the shareholders for vote.\nFurthermore, on February 10, 2020, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Mr. Glaser pursuant to which Mr. Glaser invested approximately $10.0 million in RealNetworks in exchange for the issuance to him of approximately 8 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. The rights, preferences, limitations, and powers of the Series B Preferred Stock are set forth in and governed by the designation of rights and preferences of Series B Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington. Those rights, preferences, limitations, and powers include the right to proportional adjustment and the right to any dividends or distributions declared with regard to our common stock, but the Series B Preferred Stock has no voting or consent rights, has no liquidation preference, has no preferred dividend, and has limitations on transferability. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of our common stock, however no conversion is permitted in the event that it would cause Mr. Glaser\u2019s beneficial ownership of our common stock to exceed the 38.5% threshold set forth in our shareholder rights plan dated November 30, 2018.\nThe stock ownership of Mr. Glaser may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of RealNetworks, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nProvisions of our charter documents, shareholder rights plan, and Washington law could discourage our acquisition by a third party.\nOur articles of incorporation provide for a strategic transactions committee of the board of directors. Without the prior approval of this committee, and subject to certain limited exceptions, the board of directors does not have the authority to:\n\u2022adopt a plan of merger;\n\u2022authorize the sale, lease, exchange or mortgage of assets representing more than 50% of the book value of our assets prior to the transaction or on which our long-term business strategy is substantially dependent;\n\u2022authorize our voluntary dissolution; or\n\u2022take any action that has the effect of any of the above.\nMr. Glaser has special rights under our articles of incorporation to appoint or remove members of the strategic transactions committee at his discretion that could make it more difficult for RealNetworks to be sold or to complete another change of control transaction without Mr. Glaser\u2019s consent. RealNetworks has also entered into an agreement providing Mr. Glaser with certain contractual rights relating to the enforcement of our charter documents and Mr. Glaser\u2019s roles and authority within RealNetworks. These rights and his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors, together with Mr. Glaser\u2019s significant beneficial ownership, create unique potential for concentrated influence of Mr. Glaser over potentially material transactions involving RealNetworks and decisions regarding the future strategy and leadership of RealNetworks.\nWe have adopted a shareholder rights plan, which was amended and restated in December 2008, amended in April 2016 and February 2018, and again amended and restated in November 2018. The plan provides that shares of our common stock have associated preferred stock purchase rights, the exercise of which would make the acquisition of RealNetworks by a third party more expensive to that party, having the effect of discouraging third parties from acquiring RealNetworks without the approval of our board of directors, which has the power to redeem these rights and prevent their exercise.\nWashington law imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. The foregoing provisions of our charter documents, shareholder rights plan, our agreement with Mr. Glaser, and Washington law, as well as our charter provisions that provide for a classified board of directors and the availability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, could have the effect of making it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions may therefore have the effect of limiting the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nOur January 2019 acquisition of a majority stake in Napster subjects our consolidated financial condition to new risks and uncertainties, including the following:\nNapster\u2019s financial results and growth are subject to risks involving revenue concentration, strategic focus, and market competition.\nIn recent years, Napster\u2019s business has shifted from a predominant reliance on a direct to consumer subscription model to delivering its music streaming content to users through business partners. With this shift in strategy, Napster\u2019s revenue has become concentrated among fewer partners, its sales cycle has become longer and more complex, and its competitive landscape has shifted. All of these factors contribute to risks and uncertainties that could impair the implementation of Napster\u2019s growth strategy thus causing declines in Napster\u2019s revenue and gross margin. Any such declines would negatively impact our consolidated financial results.\nAs Napster\u2019s direct to consumer subscription base declines due to intense competition in the music streaming market, its growth has become dependent on successful implementation of its platform-as-a-service strategy. Reliance on fewer key partnerships brings risk to Napster\u2019s revenue base, and developing relationships with distribution partners requires a significant investment of time and resources, with partnerships taking longer to execute than anticipated and terms becoming increasingly complex as negotiations continue. The result is a higher degree of risk in Napster\u2019s revenue base, compressed margins, and more uncertainty in its strategy.\nNapster\u2019s access to content and dependence on third-party licenses cause substantial risk and uncertainty to its business and could, therefore, harm our financial results.\nNapster\u2019s business relies on its ability to access content in a cost-efficient and dependable manner. To secure the rights necessary to stream music to its users, Napster must obtain licenses from record labels, aggregators, artists, publishers, performing rights organizations, collecting societies, and other copyrights owners and their agents. These rights holders, to the extent that Napster is able to identify them, possess different levels of bargaining power, require payment by Napster of varying royalty rates, and may or may not continue to make licenses available to Napster. Uncertainty with regard to, and any significant changes in, royalty rates, content availability, or Napster\u2019s ability to identify and negotiate with these rights holders could have a material adverse effect on Napster\u2019s revenue, profitability, and ability to provide its services. This, in turn, could harm our financial condition and stock price.\nRelated to Napster\u2019s ability to access the content necessary to provide its streaming services is its dependence on third-party licenses, including the major record labels that hold the rights to stream a significant number of sound recordings. Specifically, three major labels dominate the market, and the loss of access to content controlled by any one of these labels would materially limit Napster\u2019s offering, which would likely result in the loss of users, through both consumer subscriptions and business partnerships. Any such loss could materially impact Napster\u2019s revenue and cause negative implications to our consolidated financial results.\nThe various complexities involved in Napster\u2019s music royalty accrual could negatively impact our financial results.\nAs is common in the music streaming industry, Napster\u2019s ability to determine and appropriately accrue music royalty liabilities involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty. This accrual requires, among other things, identification of rights holders, application of statutory and contractual royalty rates, contractual terms such as advances and minimum guarantees, estimation of market share, user information and geographies, and a significant degree of judgment. Also, in certain jurisdictions, rights holders may have several years to claim royalties for musical compositions, in respect of which ownership has not already been claimed. While Napster bases its estimates on contractual rates, historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The complexity, subjectivity, and variability around Napster\u2019s royalty accrual could result in actual royalty costs exceeding amounts accrued, negatively impacting Napster\u2019s profitability and our financial results.\nAlso common in the industry are royalty audits, lawsuits filed by rights holders, and other third-party assertions related to use of content on our platform. Napster has been the target of these types of actions in the past and expects to continue to be in the future. These matters create uncertainty, are costly, and can require a significant amount of management\u2019s attention. Moreover, negotiations and disclosures related to these types of matters and disputes can cause damage to key business relationships, which could materially harm Napster\u2019s business and prospects, thus impairing our consolidated financial results.\nUnderlying the complexity and risk involved in Napster\u2019s ability to determine its music royalty liabilities, is the reliability of its systems of internal control and disclosure controls and procedures. We cannot provide assurance that these systems are or will continue to be effective. Although a subsidiary of ours, Napster has not historically been subject to public reporting requirements or the level of visibility and scrutiny that accompanies public reporting. In the event that Napster\u2019s system of internal controls, particularly relating to its music royalty accrual, is found to be ineffective, it would likely have significant implications to Napster\u2019s financial results and, therefore, to our consolidated financial results, and could be implicated in our required testing of internal controls pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.", "PERMNO": 85576, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RNWK"}
