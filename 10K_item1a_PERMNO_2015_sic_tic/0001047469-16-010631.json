{"cik": "1027207", "company": "EPIQ SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe compete with other third-party providers on the basis of the technological features, capabilities and price of our products and services, and we could lose existing clients and fail to attract new business if we do not keep pace with technological changes and offer competitive pricing for our products and services and a competitive cost structure.\nThe markets for our products and services are competitive, continually evolving and subject to technological change. We believe that key competitive factors in the markets we serve include the breadth and quality of professional services, system and software solution offerings, the stability of our information systems, the features and capabilities of the product and service offerings, the pricing of our products and services, and the potential for future product and service enhancements. Our success depends upon our ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client requirements. If we do not keep pace with technological changes, we could lose existing clients and fail to attract new business. Likewise, technology products and services can become more price sensitive over time, and if we are not able to maintain price competitive products and services, we could lose existing clients and fail to attract new clients. The impact of not keeping pace with technological changes or maintaining competitive pricing and cost structure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSecurity problems with our systems, software products or services, including data breaches or the improper disclosure of personal or corporate data, could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients and fail to attract new clients, cause increased cybersecurity protection costs and general service costs, and result in liability and increased expense for litigation and diversion of management time.\nWe store and process large amounts of our clients' confidential information and personally identifiable information. Our software products enable our clients to store and process personal data and confidential information. We have included security features in our products and processes that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of data, including confidential client or consumer data. Security is critical given the confidential nature of the information contained in our systems. It is possible that our security controls, our selection and training of employees, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to attract new clients and subject us to liability in regulatory proceedings and private litigation under laws that protect personal data, resulting in loss of revenue or increased costs. Improper disclosure of personal or corporate data could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings alleging damages and the perception that our products and services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information and could inhibit sales of our products and services. Defending these types of claims could result in increased expenses for litigation and claims settlement and a significant diversion of our management's attention.\nAdditionally, our software products, the systems on which the products are used, and our processes may not be impervious to intentional break-ins (\"hacking\"), cyber-attacks or other disruptive disclosures or problems, whether as a result of inadvertent third-party action, employee action, malfeasance, or otherwise. Hacking, cyber-attacks or other disruptive problems could result in the diversion of our development resources, damage to our reputation, increased cybersecurity protection costs and general service costs and impaired market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could result in lower revenues or higher expenses.\nGeneral economic conditions and the cyclical nature of certain markets we serve may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy, which impacts these markets. Any sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a downturn of or uncertainty in the global economy or in any specific market we serve may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, any decrease in litigation filings, class action proceedings and settlement administrations or bankruptcy filings may reduce the demand for our products and services in our Bankruptcy and Settlement Administration segment and Technology segment. Specifically, our Bankruptcy and Settlement Administration segment has experienced decreased operating revenues as a result of declines in the number of new bankruptcy cases. We expect the trend of decreased bankruptcy filings to continue into 2016, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nErrors or fraud related to our business processes could cause increased expense for litigation and diversion of management attention.\nWe administer claims, disburse funds, generate and distribute legal notices, provide data productions and provide professional services for third parties. Errors or fraud could occur, for example, in the payment of bankruptcy or settlement claims in a case we are administering. Errors or fraud related to the processing or payment of these claims or errors related to the delivery of professional services could result in the diversion of management resources, damage to our reputation, increased service costs or impaired market acceptance of our services, any of which could result in higher expenses and lower revenues. Additionally, these types of errors or fraud could result in lawsuits alleging damages. Defending these types of claims could result in increased expenses for litigation and claims settlement and a significant diversion of our management's attention.\nInterruptions or delays in service at the data centers we utilize could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nWe provide services through computer hardware that is located in data centers operated by unrelated third parties. We do not control the operation of these facilities, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide, and they are subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures and similar events. These facilities are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. The occurrence of any of these events, a decision to close a facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in interruptions in certain of our services. In addition, the failure by our vendor to provide our required data communications capacity could result in poor service or interruptions in our service. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems or services could reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause clients to terminate their agreements with us and adversely affect our ability to secure business in the future. Our business will be harmed if our clients and potential clients believe our services are unreliable.\nReleases of new software products or upgrades to our existing software products or licensed third-party software may have undetected errors, or may not operate as intended or achieve our client's desired objectives, which could cause litigation claims against us, damage to our reputation, or loss of business.\nCertain of our services utilize software solutions developed by us or third parties for the needs of our clients. New releases of software products are issued to our clients periodically. Complex software products, such as those we offer, can contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released, or may fail to operate as intended or achieve the client's desired objectives. Any introduction of new software products or upgrade to existing software products has a risk of undetected\nerrors. These undetected errors may be discovered only after a product has been installed and used either in our internal processing or by our clients. Likewise, the software products we acquire in business acquisitions have a risk of undetected errors.\nAny undetected errors, difficulties in installing and maintaining our software products or upgrade releases, difficulties training clients and their staffs on the utilization of new software products or upgrade releases, or the failure to achieve the client's desired objectives, may result in a delay or loss of revenue, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, the loss of that client, loss of future business, increased service costs, potential litigation claims against us, or impaired market acceptance of our products.\nThe unavailability of third-party technology could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.\nWe license certain eDiscovery-related software from third parties and incorporate or integrate such components into and with our services and products. For instance, we integrate third-party solutions licensed from certain providers such as kCura, Microsoft, and Oracle with the delivery of our eDiscovery services and products. Certain third-party software has become central to the operation and delivery of our eDiscovery services and products.\nA large portion of third-party software license contracts expires within one to five years and may be renewed only by mutual consent. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these contracts as they expire or that such renewals will be on the same or substantially similar terms or on conditions that are commercially reasonable to us. If we fail to renew these contracts as they expire, we may be unable to offer certain eDiscovery-related services and products to our clients. In addition, most of our third-party software licenses are non-exclusive; and therefore, our competitors may obtain the right to license certain of the technology covered by these agreements to compete directly with us.\nIf certain of our third-party licensors were to change product offerings, cease actively supporting the technologies, fail to update and enhance the technologies to keep pace with changing industry standards, encounter technical difficulties in the continuing development of these technologies, significantly increase prices, terminate our licenses, suffer significant capacity or supply chain constraints or suffer significant disruptions, we would need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our eDiscovery-related services and products. Such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms, or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the current licenses provided by our existing suppliers. If the cost of licensing or maintaining the third party intellectual property significantly increases, our operating earnings could significantly decrease. In addition, interruption in functionality of our services and products as a result of changes in or with third party licensors could adversely affect our commitments to clients, future sales of solutions, and negatively affect our revenue and operating earnings.\nUpgrades and implementation of our financial, operating and information systems may adversely affect our business or the results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nIf our systems do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect financial, operating and information systems, our ability to produce financial and operational reports, and/or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, our information systems will continue to require modification and refinements to address growth and changing business requirements, including requirements related to our international operations. In addition, our systems may require modification to enable us to comply with changing regulatory requirements, which could be expensive to implement and may divert management's attention from other key initiatives. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively modify our systems as necessary.\nWe depend upon our key personnel, and we may not be able to retain them or to attract, assimilate and retain highly qualified employees in the future.\nOur future success may depend upon the continued service of our senior management and certain of our key technical and sales personnel and our continuing ability to attract, assimilate and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, and sales and marketing personnel. The loss of services from any of these persons may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. We maintain key-man life insurance policies on our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Operating Officer, but we do not carry key-man life insurance on any other key personnel. We have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers that contain restrictive covenants relating to non-competition and non-solicitation of our clients and employees. Nevertheless, each executive officer may terminate his or her employment at any time without cause or good reason, and so as a practical matter these agreements do not guarantee the continued service of these executives. The loss of the services of any executive officer or other key personnel, including key technical and sales professionals, or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe integration of acquired businesses is time consuming, may distract our management from our other operations, may not be effective, and can be expensive, all of which could reduce or eliminate our expected earnings.\nWe have acquired businesses in the past, and we may consider opportunities in the future to acquire other companies, assets or product lines that complement or expand our business. If we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or product lines with our existing operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions to our operations. A difficult or unsuccessful integration of an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from companies or businesses we acquire include those associated with:\n\u2022 unexpected losses of key employees or clients of the acquired business;\n\u2022 conforming standards, processes, systems, procedures and controls of the acquired business with our operations;\n\u2022 increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022 difficulties in transferring processes and know-how;\n\u2022 difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products;\n\u2022 diversion of management's attention from other business concerns to the acquired business; and\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing business relationships with clients.\nWe have international business operations, which subjects us to additional risks associated with these international operations.\nWe have international operations with offices and data centers in Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, and another data center in China, all primarily related to our eDiscovery business. We could continue to expand internationally by entering into other world markets, such as the recent start of operations in India and the formation of a new legal entity in Poland in January 2016. It requires management attention and financial resources to develop successful global operations. In addition, new operations in geographies we may enter may not be immune from possible government monitoring or intrusion.\nInternational operations are subject to additional inherent risks, including certain risks that are not present with our domestic operations, and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include:\n\u2022 difficulties and costs in recruiting effective management for international operations;\n\u2022 foreign certification, licensing and regulatory requirements, which may be substantially more complex or burdensome than our domestic requirements;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 risk associated with selecting or terminating partners for foreign expansions, including marketing agents, distributors or other strategic partners for particular markets;\n\u2022 changes to or reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022 risk associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 consequences from changes in applicable international tax laws;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held in foreign countries in a tax-efficient manner;\n\u2022 risk associated with local ownership and/or investment requirements, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations;\n\u2022 political and economic instability, national calamities, war, and terrorism;\n\u2022 reduced protection of confidential consumer information in some countries; and\n\u2022 different or additional functionality requirements for our software and services.\nIf we are not able to quickly adapt to or effectively manage our geographic markets outside of the United States, our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nThe software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights. Our technologies or components thereof may not be able to withstand such claims. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan, and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, certain client agreements require us to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. An adverse determination could also prevent us from offering (or temporarily offering) our service to others, which could result in a loss of revenues and profits.\nFuture government legislation or changes in judicial interpretations could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur products and services are not directly regulated by the government. Both of our reportable segments and the clients served by those segments are, however, directly or indirectly affected by certain laws and regulations and judicial interpretations. For example, bankruptcy reform legislation, class action and tort reform legislation and amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding discovery of \"electronically stored information\" have all affected our clients, and indirectly,\nour business. Future laws and regulations, or judicial interpretations thereof, could adversely affect our clients and thus could have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nGoodwill and intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill was approximately $477.5 million, or approximately 58% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2015. We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting unit level. Goodwill is assessed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our impairment reviews require extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organization level, could produce significantly different results. We may be required to recognize impairment of goodwill based on future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Impairment of goodwill could result in material charges that could, in the future, result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to uncertainties regarding the economic environment, there can be no assurances that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenues or margins of certain of our reporting units are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would occur, and if it does occur, whether such charge would be material.\nOur quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. If they do, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. This could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Our quarterly revenues and operating results can be difficult to forecast. Our business will continue to be affected by a number of factors, any one of which could substantially affect our results of operations for a particular fiscal quarter. Specifically, our quarterly results from operations can vary due to:\n\u2022 initiation or termination of a large engagement;\n\u2022 timing, size, cancellation or rescheduling of client orders;\n\u2022 unanticipated technology or other expenses;\n\u2022 changes in financial accounting and reporting standards, interpretations or positions that govern the preparation of our financial statements;\n\u2022 unexpected legal or regulatory expenses;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the trustee services deposit portfolio;\n\u2022 fluctuations in number of bankruptcy filings; and\n\u2022 fluctuations in short-term interest rates.\nIt is possible that our future quarterly results from operations from time to time will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. This could cause a material decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile even if our quarterly results do not fluctuate significantly.\nEven if we report stable or increased earnings, the market price of our common stock may be volatile. There are a number of factors, beyond earnings fluctuations, that can affect the market price of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022 average daily trading volume of our stock is low compared to total outstanding shares;\n\u2022 decrease in market demand for our stock;\n\u2022 downward revisions in securities analysts' estimates;\n\u2022 announcements of technological innovations or new product or services offerings developed by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements pertaining to our review of strategic and financial alternatives;\n\u2022 receipt of unsolicited letters expressing interest in acquiring us;\n\u2022 legal proceedings;\n\u2022 degree of client acceptance of new products or enhancements offered by us; and\n\u2022 general market conditions and other economic factors.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock has been volatile, and this is likely to continue.\nWe are in the process of conducting a review of strategic and financial alternatives that could adversely impact our business or our stock price.\nIn September 2014, we announced that the Company and its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") had commenced a process to explore a full range of strategic and financial alternatives, which may include among other things, acquisitions, divestitures, or a going-private or recapitalization transaction, in order to determine a course of action that is in the best interest of all shareholders. We have also received unsolicited letters expressing interest in acquiring us and in conducting a proxy contest. The strategic review process, as well as the unsolicited letters, could expose us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in our stock price in response to developments or speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic and financial alternatives and/or expressed interests; distraction of management; difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel as a result of uncertainty generated by the strategic review and/or expressed interests or any related developments; difficulties in maintaining relationships or arrangements with clients, suppliers and other third parties; substantial increases in general and administrative expenses associated with the need to retain and compensate legal, financial, and other advisors as a result of the strategic review and/or expressed interests; and litigation in connection with the strategic review and/or expressed interests or any related developments or actions. There can be no assurance that the strategic review and/or expressed interests will result in consummation of any transaction. The occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have an adverse impact on our business, stock price, financial results, liquidity, and financial condition.\nWe could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest and related litigation.\nOn December 7, 2015, St. Denis J. Villere & Company, L.L.C. (\"Villere\") and George Young (the \"Plaintiffs\"), who have reported to beneficially own approximately 14% of our common stock, purported to nominate six directors for our Board. We rejected Villere's nominations because, among\nother things, Villere is prohibited from nominating directors under the terms of the Director Appointment Agreement that we entered into with Villere and Mr. Kevin L. Robert on November 1, 2014 (the \"Director Appointment Agreement\") and Villere failed to comply with our amended and restated bylaws. In response, on December 11, 2015, Villere filed a petition, which it later amended, in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, against us and our directors (excluding Mr. Kevin L. Robert) for declaratory and injunctive relief. The Company filed counterclaims against the Plaintiffs, and amended such counterclaims to include certain Villere clients, for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. Villere's amended petition seeks to have the Director Appointment Agreement declared terminated and its purported nominations be effective so that Villere can then submit such nominations for a vote at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2016. See \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\" A proxy contest and related litigation negatively affect us because:\n\u2022 responding to proxy contests, litigation, and other actions by dissident shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our review of strategic and financial alternatives and operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees;\n\u2022 unqualified director nominees could be submitted to a shareholder vote and gain a seat on the Board;\n\u2022 they may divert the attention of, damage the morale, and create instability among our business partners, management and employees, and adversely impact our existing and potential strategic and operational relationships and opportunities;\n\u2022 we may experience difficulties in hiring, retaining, and motivating personnel during the resulting uncertain and turbulent times;\n\u2022 if individuals are elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our current business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022 increases in legal fees, administrative, and associated costs incurred in connection with responding to a proxy contest and related litigation could be substantial; and\n\u2022 a proxy contest, or the threat of one, could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nWe may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, and our common stock may not appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which it was purchased.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. Certain provisions in our credit agreement dated August 27, 2013 (as subsequently amended, the \"Credit Agreement\"), governing our senior secured credit facility may restrict our ability to pay dividends in the future. Subject to any financial covenants in current or future financing agreements that directly or indirectly restrict the payment of dividends, the payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our future earnings and cash flow from operations, our capital requirements, our financial condition and any other factors that the Board may consider. Unless we continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon its future appreciation. Our common stock may not appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which it was purchased.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and obligations, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable-rate debt, and adversely affect our financial results.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding indebtedness totaling $388.8 million, including $367.2 million of principal amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our current indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the current indebtedness or future indebtedness.\nDebt covenants in the Credit Agreement governing our senior secured credit facility require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios and other requirements. If we are not able to maintain compliance with these requirements, all of our then-outstanding debt could become immediately due and payable.\nOur Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant related to a net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which is not permitted to exceed 4.50 to 1.00 as well as other customary covenants related to limitations on (i) creating liens, debt, guarantees or other contingent obligations, (ii) engaging in mergers, acquisitions and consolidations, (iii) paying dividends or other distributions to, and redeeming and repurchasing securities from, equity holders, (iv) prepaying, redeeming or repurchasing subordinated or junior debt, and (v) engaging in certain transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. The amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement. While we do not presently expect to be in violation of any of these requirements, no assurances can be given that we will be able to remain in compliance. There can be no assurance that our actual financial results will match our projected results or that we will not violate such covenants. Any failure to continue to comply with such requirements could materially adversely affect our borrowing ability and access to liquidity, and thus our overall financial condition.\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\nInterest on principal amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility is based on a variable interest, and therefore, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments as part of our financial risk management strategy to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. There is no assurance that our financial risk management strategy will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. If interest rates increase and we are unable to implement our risk strategy, our income could be negatively affected.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock and/or preferred stock, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of February 25, 2016, there were 37,672,402 shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We may conduct future offerings of our common stock or preferred stock to fund acquisitions, finance operations or for general corporate purposes. In addition, we may also issue common stock under our equity awards programs. Any issuance of additional\ncommon stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing holders of common stock, and may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur articles of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Missouri law contain provisions that could be used by us to discourage or prevent a takeover.\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or to remove our current Board and management, even if the change of control or removal of our Board and management would be beneficial to certain shareholders. For example, our articles of incorporation include \"blank check\" preferred stock provisions, which permit our Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholder approval. In conjunction with the issuance of a series of preferred stock, the Board is authorized to fix the rights of that series, including voting rights, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and redemption privileges. The Board could issue a series of preferred stock to a friendly investor and use one or more of these features of the preferred stock to discourage or prevent a takeover of us. Additionally, our articles of incorporation do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors. Cumulative voting, if available, would enable minority shareholders to elect one or more representatives to the Board in certain circumstances, which could be used by third parties to facilitate a takeover of us that was opposed by our Board or management. Our amended and restated bylaws impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholders' meetings. A third party attempting to acquire us may have difficulty in complying with those requirements.\nIn addition, the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, under which we are incorporated, provides that any merger involving us must be approved by the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on the merger. Presently, our only outstanding voting securities are our shares of common stock. Accordingly, shareholders with voting power over as little as one-third of our outstanding common stock could block a merger proposal, even if that merger proposal was supported by our Board or shareholders holding a majority of our then outstanding shares of common stock.", "PERMNO": 84531, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "EPIQ"}
