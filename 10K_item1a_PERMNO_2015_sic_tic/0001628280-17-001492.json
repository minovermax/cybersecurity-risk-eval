{"cik": "933141", "company": "IBERIABANK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are risks, many beyond our control, which could cause our results to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations. Some of these risk factors are described below. Any factor described in this report could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material also may materially and adversely affect us. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information disclosed in our SEC filings, including the financial statements and notes thereto.\nMARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\nChallenging economic conditions or volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse impact on our business, leading to diminished financial results and position.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent on IBERIABANK\u2019s net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, competition for loans and deposits, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nAlthough the general economic environment has shown improvement since the end of the economic recession in June 2009, there can be no assurance that improvement will continue. Economic growth has been slow and uneven, and continuing concerns over the federal deficit and government spending have contributed to uncertain conditions for the economy. The change in domestic government administration in early 2017 may have positive ramifications toward mitigating adverse impacts on the business, including, but not limited to: possible higher levels of interest rates, potential for greater loan fee revenues from commercial/business capital investment, reduction in corporate tax rate levels, and relaxation of financial regulatory reform. However, a return of recessionary conditions, including declines in real estate values and sales volumes, an increase in unemployment, and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect economic conditions in the market areas in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, supply of and demand for deposits, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nIn addition, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest, slow growth in the global economy, continued concerns over the oil supply and depressed energy prices, as well as acts of terrorism, war and other violence could result in further disruptions in the financial markets. These negative events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including our liquidity position, and may affect our ability to access capital.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions. Adverse economic factors affecting particular geographies or industries, especially the Southeastern U.S. or the energy industry, could have a negative effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our offices are primarily concentrated in selected markets in the southeastern United States. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas.\nCertain industry-specific economic factors affect these geographies. Approximately 3.7% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 was comprised of loans to borrowers in the energy industry, primarily in Louisiana and Texas. The energy industry is historically cyclical and is currently experiencing a significant and prolonged decline in crude oil prices caused by increased domestic and international production, leading to excess supply, coupled with slowing global economic growth and weaker global demand. A continued severe and prolonged depression in commodity prices would adversely affect the energy industry and the broader financial markets, and consequently negatively impact our business. A downturn in segments of the commercial and residential real estate industries in our markets due to adverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have an adverse effect on our customers. Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage; and/or\n\u2022\na decrease in supply of customer deposits, which could impact our liquidity.\nThe Government\u2019s responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) of the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d), in an attempt to stimulate the overall economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate. In December 2016, the FOMC voted to raise the target federal funds rate for only the second time since 2006. The FOMC expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant additional gradual increases in the federal funds rate in 2017 and over the next several years. As the FOMC increases the federal funds rate, it is possible that overall interest rates could rise, which may negatively impact the U.S. real estate markets and economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in interest rates and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, and we may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur net interest income may be reduced if more interest-earning assets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are declining, or more interest-bearing liabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are rising.\nChanges in the difference between short- and long-term interest rates may also harm our business. For example, short-term deposits may be used to fund longer-term loans. When differences between short-term and long-term interest rates shrink or disappear, as is possible in the current low interest rate policy environment, the spread between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly, thereby decreasing our net interest income.\nIf market interest rates rise rapidly, interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in interest rates on adjustable rate loans, thereby reducing our net interest income. Similarly, interest rate adjustment floors may limit the upside benefit to increases in interest rates. In the event that market interest rates fall rapidly, loan and bond prepayments may occur as borrowers refinance and pay off debt prior to stated maturity. As a result, yields on earning assets could decline, thereby reducing net interest income. If an unprecedented negative rate environment were to occur, our operations and margin would be adversely impacted and could result in increased credit losses.\nWe attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing characteristics, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. We employ the use of models and modeling techniques to quantify the levels of risks to net interest income, which inherently involve the use of assumptions, judgments, and estimates. While we strive to ensure the accuracy of our modeled interest rate risk profile, there are inherent limitations and imprecisions in this determination and actual results may differ. As of December 31, 2016, a 100 basis point instantaneous and parallel upward shift in interest rates at December 31, 2016, was estimated to increase net interest income over 12 months by approximately 6.1%. Similarly, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates was expected to decrease net interest income by 7.9% over the same period.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 44% of our total loan portfolio had fixed interest rates. Eliminating fixed rate loans that mature within a one-year time frame decreases this percentage to approximately 28% at December 31, 2016. Nearly 95% of the investment portfolio had fixed interest rates as of December 31, 2016. Approximately 63% of our time deposit base and 35% of our Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings will mature and/or re-price within 12 months.\nIf we or our subsidiaries were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or the operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. IBERIABANK\u2019s liquidity primarily is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by our Board of Directors. Management and the Investment Committee regularly monitor the overall liquidity position of IBERIABANK and the Company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Management and the Investment Committee also establish policies and monitor guidelines to diversify IBERIABANK\u2019s funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, customer deposits, and short- and long-term debt. IBERIABANK is also a member of the FHLB System, which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.\nWe maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include sales or securitizations of loans, our ability to acquire additional national market, non-core or brokered deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as the FRB discount window, the issuance and sale of debt securities, and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private offerings. Amounts available under our existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2016 consist of $4.9 billion in FHLB availability and $155 million in the form of federal funds lines and $25 million in other lines of credit.\nIf we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers\u2019 needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nAdditionally, the Company is often the recipient of dividends from its subsidiaries, including IBERIABANK, and may rely on these dividends as a source of cash flow. The amount of future dividends from IBERIABANK is dependent upon its performance and could be impacted by future unanticipated economic conditions and regulatory limitations. Such events could impact the Company\u2019s ability to declare future dividends and ultimately its solvency if other sources of cash flows were not available.\nDeposit run-off or a change in deposit mix could increase our funding costs.\nA major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on amounts used to fund assets and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets. We rely on deposits as a stable, low-cost source of funding for our interest-earning assets. We must compete with other banks and financial institutions for deposits. If our competitors raise rates on their deposits, we may face deposit attrition or experience higher funding costs by increasing our deposit rates in order to maintain our customer deposit base. Higher funding costs would increase interest expense, thereby reducing our net interest margin, net interest income, and net income. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 28% of our deposits were non-interest-bearing.\nMarket perceptions of our credit risk could impair our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nOur liquidity and borrowing costs are largely impacted by our credit risk. Market perception, given the lack of a public credit rating, could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital markets or borrow funds and increase the costs of capital and borrowings. In addition, deterioration in our credit risk, whether actual or perceived, could trigger unfavorable contractual obligations, resulting in the requirement to post additional collateral or realize credit-related contingent features.\nCREDIT RISKS\nLike most banking organizations, our business is highly susceptible to credit risk.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans (if any) may not be sufficient to satisfy our customers\u2019 loan obligations in the event of default. Credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total loan portfolio was approximately $15.1 billion, or 70% of total assets. At that date, the major components of our loan portfolio comprised 73% commercial loans (45% real estate, 24% commercial and industrial, and 4% energy), 8% mortgage loans (primarily residential 1-4 family mortgage loans), and 19% consumer loans. Our credit risk with respect to our consumer installment and commercial loan portfolios relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses within our local market areas. Our credit risk with respect to our residential and commercial real estate mortgage and construction loan portfolios relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses, the value of real estate as collateral, and guarantors serving as security for the repayment of the loans.\nOur loan portfolio has been and will continue to be affected by real estate markets. Real estate industry pricing dynamics in the geographical markets we operate can vary from year to year, and with respect to construction, can vary between project funding and project completion. Asset values to which we underwrite loans can fluctuate from year to year and impact collateral values and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. An additional risk in connection with loans secured by commercial real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination, which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as security, or could expose us to remediation liabilities as the lender. In addition, the energy industry has experienced a prolonged decline in crude oil prices caused by\noversupply and weaker global demand, which has had a negative impact on both commercial and consumer borrowers. We make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of borrowers or projects combined with our expectations for the future. If a deterioration in economic conditions or prices beyond our expectations were to occur in any of the market areas we serve, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies above amounts provided for in the allowance for credit losses. As such, our earnings could be adversely affected through higher than anticipated provisions for loan losses.\nWe frequently participate in group lending transactions, such as participations or syndications, which include shared national credits. These transactions often have a lead bank that is responsible for servicing the overall credit facility. In that capacity, the lead bank is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the borrower's financial performance, covenant compliance and collateral verification, among other duties. In transactions where IBERIABANK serves as the lead, we are obligated to properly manage certain credits on behalf of other banks. In other group lending transactions, we must rely on another bank serving in the lead capacity to execute the respective duties and communicate relevant information on the borrower's status. In those instances where we are not the lead bank, we may not receive information that impacts our risk rating process in a timely manner, and/or have limited ability to influence situations that require resolution of a problem asset, which could result in unforeseen credit losses. In addition, shared national credits are a specific focus of regulatory examinations that can result in directed downgrades, including placement of a credit on non-accrual status, reversal of interest previously recorded as income and/or charge-offs.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, which could adversely affect our earnings. Events unforeseen by us could result in higher loan losses impacting our results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (\u201callowance\u201d) in an attempt to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio (funded and unfunded). Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date based on unanticipated adverse changes and/or new facts and circumstances which are currently not available to management as of the respective reporting period. Increases in the allowance will result in decreases in our earnings.\nThe determination of the allowance, which represents management\u2019s estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit portfolio, involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. Changes in these estimates (i.e., creditworthiness) may have a significant impact on our financial statements. If our assumptions and judgments require modifications, our current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Further, changes in market factors, such as interest rates or commodity prices, could lead to increases in the allowance. While management monitors these market dynamics carefully, adverse changes to these factors could be unforeseen by management and would result in higher levels of allowance and credit losses. For example, unanticipated adjustments to management\u2019s current expectations in commodity prices (e.g., oil) could have an adverse impact to the allowance as the borrower\u2019s ability to repay within the terms of the contractual agreement may be reduced due to a lack of sufficient free cash flows, estimated collateral values may decline given the lack of market demand for collateralized assets (e.g., equipment, pipelines, etc.), and the Company\u2019s ability to monetize guarantor support may be impaired as guarantor net worth may diminish.\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or other loans or investments. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of a material amount of these loans may cause a significant increase in non-performing assets, TDRs and/or past due loans. An increase in non-performing assets, TDRs, and/or past due loans could result in a loss of earnings, an increase in the provision for credit losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of multi-family, commercial business and commercial real estate loans, as well as any future credit deterioration, could also require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.\nWe earn a significant portion of our non-interest revenue through sales of residential mortgages in the secondary market. We are exposed to counterparty credit, market, repurchase and other risks associated with these activities.\nOur non-interest revenue attributable to mortgage banking activities has grown significantly in recent years.See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-interest Income\u201d in Exhibit\n13 to this Form 10-K. The Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the normal course of these sales activities as well as market risk when engaging in these activities that is greatly impacted by the amount of liquidity in the secondary markets and changes in interest rates. We attempt to hedge our market risk based on modeling assumptions. The performance of these hedges could result in a deviation from our expectation and our operating results could be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, the Company retains repurchase risk associated with sales of these loans that is related to the Company\u2019s residential mortgage loan underwriting and closing practices. Increases in claims under these repurchase or make-whole demands, which typically arise when a borrower defaults, could have a material impact on our ability to continue participating in these types of activities as well as a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDeclines in the value of certain investment securities could require write-downs, which would reduce our earnings.\nOur securities portfolio includes securities that are subject to declines in value due to negative perceptions about the health of the financial sector in general and the lack of liquidity for securities that are real estate related. A prolonged decline in the value of these or other securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down, which would reduce our earnings. In the case of issuer default, a permanent impairment could be required that would reduce our earnings.\nIf our investment in the common stock of the FHLB of Dallas is classified as other-than-temporarily impaired or as permanently impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity could decrease.\nWe hold FHLB stock to qualify for membership in the FHLB System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. The aggregate cost and fair value of our FHLB common stock as of December 31, 2016 was $42 million based on its par value. There is no market for FHLB common stock.\nPublished reports indicate that certain member banks of the FHLB System may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels. In an extreme situation, it is possible that the capital of a FHLB could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, we believe that there is a risk that our investment in FHLB common stock could be impaired at some time in the future and, if this occurs, it would cause our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity to decrease by the after-tax amount of the impairment charge.\nREGULATORY/COMPLIANCE RISK\nChanges in government regulations and legislation could limit our future performance and growth.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. We are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. Our compliance is costly and restricts certain of our activities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance fund, depositors, customers and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors, such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies and leasing companies. Changes in the laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for others. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change and are subject to interpretation. We cannot predict the ultimate effect of these changes or interpretations, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition.\nThe current regulatory environment may be impacted by future legislative developments, such as amendments to key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. On January 20, 2017, Mr. Donald J. Trump became President of the United States. On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the administration to review U.S. financial laws and regulations in order to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order. The full scope of President Trump\u2019s short-term legislative agenda is not yet fully known, but it may include certain deregulatory measures for the banking industry, including changes to the Volcker Rule, capital and stress testing requirements, and the structure and powers of the CFPB, among other areas.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, financial institutions generally have been subjected to increased regulation and scrutiny from federal regulatory authorities. The U.S. Congress responded to the financial crisis by enacting a variety of statutes, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act, which contained numerous far-reaching changes and reforms for the financial services industry and directed federal regulatory agencies to issue implementing regulations for these reforms.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted to implement those provisions have made far-reaching changes to the regulatory framework under which we operate. The continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as any future legislative or regulatory changes, may impact the profitability of our business activities, may require that we change certain of our business practices, may materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel, may require us to raise additional capital and could expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). These and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our financial condition and results of operations.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the CFPB, which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies. The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties. We may also be required to add additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Our business, results of operations or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.\nWe have become subject to more stringent regulatory capital requirements, which may limit our operations and potential growth or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or to repurchase shares.\nThe Company and IBERIABANK are subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB and the OFI, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements. We must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by our banking regulators, which can change depending on general economic conditions and the Company\u2019s particular condition, risk profile, growth plans, and regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If at any time we fail to meet minimum established capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn 2013, the U.S. banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel Committee, or \u201cBasel III\u201d, and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. We became subject to the new rule on January 1, 2015, and certain provisions of the new rule are being phased in from that date through January 1, 2019. The revised capital adequacy rules implement numerous requirements which require us and IBERIABANK to satisfy more stringent capital and liquidity standards than in the past.\nManagement believes that, at December 31, 2016, the Company and IBERIABANK would have met all applicable Basel III capital adequacy requirements on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were then effective. However, there can be no assurances that the Basel III capital rules will not be revised before the expiration of the phase-in periods. The final impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by U.S. banking regulators. These new requirements, however, and any other new regulations, could result in lower returns, result in regulatory actions if we were unable to comply with such requirements, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with current or new capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels. Additional information, including the Company\u2019s and IBERIABANK\u2019s compliance with applicable capital adequacy standards at December 31, 2016, is provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources\u201d incorporated herein by reference.\nWe are required to conduct and submit annual stress tests, the results of which could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or to compete for business opportunities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires us to submit a stress test to the FRB that projects the Company\u2019s performance under various economic scenarios provided by the FRB. We are required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable. The outcome of the FRB\u2019s analysis of the Company\u2019s projected performance (to include capital, earnings, and balance sheet changes) could hinder our ability to pay cash dividends to shareholders as has been the Company\u2019s practice. The results of the stress test could also impact the FRB\u2019s future decision making regarding future acquisitions by the Company.\nWe are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress.\nUnder federal law, we are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our stockholders' or our creditors\u2019 best interests to do so. Providing such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, requires financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur use of third party vendors and our other ongoing third party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators. Recent regulation requires us to enhance our due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over our third party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships. In certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third party vendors or other ongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPossible future increases in FDIC deposit insurance premiums would adversely affect our earnings.\nUnder a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011 to revise the federal deposit insurance system, deposit insurance assessments for all banks were lowered starting in the third quarter of 2016, the quarter after the ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits (the \u201cDRR\u201d) reached 1.15%. Also in the third quarter of 2016,\nbanks such as IBERIABANK with an assessment base (total assets less tangible capital) of over $10 billion became subject to a surcharge assessment at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points. The surcharge assessment, which is assessed against the assessment base of covered institutions, less $10 billion, will end when the DRR reaches 1.35% , which ratio is forecast to be achieved by the end of 2018. Management believes that the surcharge will have an immaterial effect on our deposit insurance assessments. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-interest Expense\u201d in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. In 2011, the FDIC increased the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s target DRR to 2.0% of insured deposits, and additional increases in our assessment rate may be required in the future to achieve this targeted ratio. In addition, if the number of bank failures increases in the future, the FDIC may set higher deposit insurance premiums or impose special assessments. Any future increases in FDIC deposit insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur reported financial results depend on our management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates, and there may be changes in accounting policies or accounting standards that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. Our management must also exercise judgment in selecting assumptions and estimates inherent in deriving certain financial statement line items. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy, method, assumption and/or estimate to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under another acceptable alternative.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of our external financial statements. Recently, the FASB has proposed new accounting standard updates related to the calculation of the allowance for credit losses and accounting for leases, amongst other ancillary proposed updates. The FASB has also issued final accounting standard updates which are not yet effective. A discussion of the recent significant accounting standard updates which have been issued are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated herein by reference. Accounting standard updates have the potential to alter previously issued or future financial statements depending on their deviation from current standards or industry practices and the implementation method prescribed by the FASB. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, and, as such, acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill. We perform a goodwill evaluation at least annually to test for goodwill impairment. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, the Company compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Adverse conditions in our business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, a significant change in our stock price or market capitalization, or a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill and may trigger impairment losses, which could be material to our operating results and financial condition.\nWe completed such an evaluation for the Company during the fourth quarter of 2016 and concluded that an impairment charge was not necessary for the year ended December 31, 2016. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nThe required accounting treatment of troubled loans we acquired through acquisitions could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest margins and interest income in future periods.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are required to record troubled loans acquired through acquisitions at fair value, which may underestimate or overestimate the actual performance of such loans. If these loans outperform our original fair value estimates, the difference between our original estimate and the actual performance of the loan (the \u201cdiscount\u201d) is accreted into net interest income. Thus, our net interest margins may initially appear higher. Conversely, if these loans under-perform our original fair value estimates, our net interest margins would be lower than initially estimated. We expect the yields on our loans to decline as our acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures, and we expect downward pressure on our interest income to the extent that the runoff on our acquired loan portfolio is not replaced with comparable high-yielding loans. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margins and interest income in future periods.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nA failure in or an attack on our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of our client base and our geographical reach, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements, technological shifts, integration of new platforms and third party relationships. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities, or those of our third party vendors, may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process transactions or services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks, as well as those of our third party vendors. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of these threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nIf one or more of these cyber incidents occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss. Potential costs of a cyber attack may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost revenue from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.\nWe maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, no assurance can be given that this policy would be sufficient to cover all potential financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nThe loss of certain key personnel could negatively affect our operations.\nAlthough we have employed a significant number of additional executive officers and other key personnel, our success continues to depend in large part on the retention of a limited number of key executive management, lending and other personnel. We could undergo a difficult transition period if we were to lose the services of any of these individuals. Our success also depends on the experience of our banking facilities\u2019 managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key persons could negatively impact the affected banking operations. The unexpected loss of key senior managers, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nThe success of bank acquisitions (which include FDIC-assisted transactions) will depend on a number of uncertain factors.\nThe success of our bank acquisitions depends on a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nOur ability to integrate the businesses acquired into IBERIABANK\u2019s current operations, including the conversion of customer loan and deposit data from the acquired banks\u2019 data processing systems to our data processing systems;\n\u2022\nOur ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired businesses and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in the geographic areas previously served by the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nOur ability to effectively compete in new markets in which we did not previously have a presence;\n\u2022\nOur success in deploying the cash acquired in these transactions into assets bearing sufficiently high yields without incurring unacceptable risk;\n\u2022\nOur ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired businesses in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022\nOur ability to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff and maintain the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired businesses.\nIn any acquisition involving a financial institution, particularly one involving the transfer of a large number of bank branches and/or customers, there may be business and service changes and disruptions, including delays or errors in the data conversion process, that result in the loss of customers or cause customers to close their accounts and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration of such acquired businesses is an operation of substantial size and expense, and may be impacted by general market and economic conditions or government actions affecting the financial services industry. Integration efforts also are likely to divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to integrate these acquired businesses successfully. The integration process could also result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of bank acquisitions. Further, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of acquired businesses will not adversely affect our existing profitability, that we will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business, that we will be able to compete effectively in the market areas currently served by the acquired businesses, or that we will be able to manage any growth resulting from financial institution acquisitions effectively.\nOur ability to grow acquired businesses following these transactions depends in part on our ability to retain certain key branch personnel we expect to hire and/or retain in connection with these transactions. We believe that the ties these employees have in the local banking markets previously served by their acquired businesses are vital to our ability to maintain our relationships with existing customers and to generate new business in these markets. Our failure to hire or retain these employees could adversely affect the success of these transactions and our future growth.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, which may adversely impact our financial performance in future periods.\nOur future financial performance depends to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth. Our growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our operations and management. Whether through acquisitions or organic growth, our current plan to expand our business is dependent upon the ability of our officers and other key employees to:\n\u2022\ncontinue to implement and improve our internal risk controls over operations, credit, financial, management and other risk categories and processes, as well as our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage a growing number of client relationships;\n\u2022\nscale our technology platform and operational infrastructure;\n\u2022\nintegrate our acquisitions and develop consistent policies throughout the various businesses acquired; and\n\u2022\nmanage a growing number of client relationships.\nWe may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our information and control systems, procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our systems, controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in transaction volume and the infrastructure that comes with new products, branches, markets or any combination thereof. Thus, our growth strategy may divert management from our existing operation and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure, adversely impacting our future financial performance. If we are unable to effectively manage and grow our company, our business and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, if we are unable to manage future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, have to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could adversely affect our business.\nCatastrophic events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events, including weather events and other natural disasters such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods and fires, or other disasters, such as crime, terrorism and other acts of violence, could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Such events can disrupt our operations, cause damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by these catastrophes will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in payment delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses.\nWe may be subject to increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nThe Company and IBERIABANK have been named from time to time as defendants in class actions and other litigation relating to our businesses and activities. Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We and our subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us, including our subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.\nSTRATEGIC/REPUTATIONAL RISKS\nOur financial performance will be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our growth strategy, which includes organic growth and growth through acquisitions.\nHistorically, the Company has grown organically and supplemented that growth with select acquisitions. Our success depends primarily on generating loans and deposits of acceptable risk and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing our organic, or internal, growth strategy. Our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion, recruit and retain qualified personnel, and fund growth at a reasonable cost, depends upon prevailing economic conditions, maintenance of sufficient capital, competitive factors, changes in banking laws, and other factors.\nSupplementing our internal growth through acquisitions is an important part of our strategic focus, and acquisitions have comprised a significant portion of our asset growth since 1995. Our acquisition efforts focus on select markets and targeted entities. We operate in markets we consider to be contiguous, or natural extensions, to our current markets. The availability of acquisition candidates that meet our strategic objectives can fluctuate, and current institutions for sale in the market may not meet our strategic objectives. Such circumstances would limit our ability to supplement our growth through acquisitions. As consolidation of the banking industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. We compete with other banking organizations for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay. We also may need additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or, if available, it may not be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. Our issuance of additional equity securities would dilute existing shareholders\u2019 interest in us and may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to combine with us on terms acceptable to us, or we are otherwise unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing necessary for us to continue making acquisitions, we would be required to find other methods to grow our business, and we may not grow at the same rate we have grown in the past, or at all.\nWe cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets and liabilities without increased expenses and higher levels of nonperforming assets. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loan balances, which may adversely affect earnings, shareholder returns, and our efficiency ratio. Increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may decrease our earnings and the value of our common stock.\nIn addition to the normal operating challenges inherent in managing a larger financial institution, each of our acquisitions and potential future acquisitions is subject to appropriate regulatory approval. Our regulators may require that we demonstrate that we have appropriately integrated our prior acquisitions, or any future acquisitions we may do, before permitting us to engage in any future material acquisitions.\nThe modeled returns of bank acquisitions will depend on a number of uncertain factors, and actual results could differ materially from our expectations.\nWe undertake a process in performing due diligence on bank acquisition targets. While this process attempts to be comprehensive, factors can arise that were not discovered or anticipated by us in this exercise. Additionally, our modeled returns are based on a variety of assumptions to include synergies, cost savings, credit losses, growth, and the fair value of assets, liabilities and contracts acquired. To the extent such factors arise or actual results differ from our assumptions, our actual shareholder returns on any given bank acquisition could differ materially from our modeled expectations.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain expense reduction and earnings enhancement initiatives may be adversely affected by external factors not within our control.\nWe continuously assess opportunities for expense reduction and revenue enhancement to improve annual returns. While many of the elements necessary to achieve certain initiatives are within our control, others such as interest rates and prevailing economic conditions, which influence expenses and revenues, depend on external factors not within our control, and there can be no assurance that external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to fully implement and accomplish past and future initiatives.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of fintech innovation.\nFintech developments, such as bitcoin, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. Investment in new technology to stay competitive would result in significant costs and increased risks of cyber security attacks. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment, which is crucial to retention and acquisition of customers. On December 2, 2016 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that it will begin granting limited-purpose national bank charters to fintech companies that offer bank products and services. The federal charter would largely allow fintech companies to operate nationwide under a single set of national standards, without needing to seek state-by-state licenses or joining with brick-and-mortar banks, and may therefore allow fintech companies to more easily compete with us for financial products and services in the communities we serve.\nWe face substantial competition and are subject to certain regulatory constraints not applicable to some of our competitors, which may decrease our growth or profits.\nWe face substantial competition for deposits, and for credit, title and trust relationships, and other financial services and products in the communities we serve. Competing providers include other banks, thrifts and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking operations, credit unions, finance companies, title companies, money market funds and other financial and nonfinancial companies which may offer products functionally equivalent to those offered by us. Competing providers may have greater financial resources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve. In addition to this challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include services that financial institutions have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. If we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional banking services and changing customer needs and preferences, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nSome of our competitors, including credit unions, are not subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Credit unions also have federal tax exemptions that may allow them to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks. In addition, non-depository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions, like IBERIABANK, that offer federally insured deposits. Other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products. These differences in resources, regulation, competitive advantages, and business strategy may decrease our net interest margin, may increase our operating costs, and may make it harder for us to compete profitably.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions of our business practices and/or our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices and/or our financial health could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts to our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may lead to greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny and litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.\nRISKS ABOUT OUR SECURITIES\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThere can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends in the future. Cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid to us from our subsidiaries. Cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid to us from our subsidiary bank, IBERIABANK. The ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends to us as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is limited by regulatory and legal restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. We may also decide to limit the payment of dividends even when we have the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in our business. Further, any lenders making loans to us may impose financial covenants that may be more restrictive than regulatory requirements with respect to the payment of dividends.\nWe are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if the required payments on our subordinated debentures have not been made. Additionally, dividends on our common stock could be adversely impacted if dividend payments on our preferred stock have not been made.\nAlthough we have paid cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the past, we may not pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the future.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such purpose. We have a history of paying dividends to our shareholders. However, future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory expectations, and other factors, including the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, which ability may be restricted by statutory, contractual or other constraints. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution. See Note 14 and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on factors impacting or restricting our ability to pay dividends\nOur common stock and our preferred stock are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock and our Series B and Series C preferred stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness of the Company. This means that shares of the common stock and depositary shares, which represent fractional interests in shares of Series B and Series C preferred stock, rank junior to all our existing and future indebtedness and our other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. We are prohibited from paying dividends on any of our capital stock if the required payments on our subordinated debentures have not been made.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future preferred stock.\nThe Company has outstanding Series B and Series C preferred stock that is senior to the common stock and could adversely affect the ability of the Company to declare or pay dividends or distributions of common stock. Under the terms of the Series B and Series C preferred stock, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock unless all full dividends for the latest dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series B and Series C preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. Furthermore, if the Company experiences a material deterioration in its financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, the Company\u2019s regulators may not permit it to make future payments on its Series B and Series C preferred stock, thereby preventing the payment of dividends on the common stock.\nWe may issue debt and/or equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our existing preferred and common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, and such an issuance could negatively affect the value of our common and preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock.\nSubject to certain conditions, holders of another class of preferred stock may be entitled to preferences over the Series B and Series C preferred stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nThe trading history of our common stock is characterized by modest trading volume.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. During 2016, the average daily trading volume of our common stock was approximately 243,000 shares. The average daily trading volume of our depositary shares, which represent fractional shares of our Series B preferred stock was approximately 5,100 shares. In addition, our Series C preferred stock , which began trading on May 9, 2016 (the date of issuance), to December 31, 2016, had average daily trading volume of approximately 5,700 shares.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to a more active trading market in our securities or how much more liquid these markets might become. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our securities at any given time, which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors, over which we have no control.\nThe market price of our securities can be volatile.\nThe market prices of our common and preferred stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate;\n\u2022\npress releases, announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in our marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and\n\u2022\nother developments affecting our competitors or us.\nThese factors may adversely affect the trading prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent our shareholders from selling their securities at or above the public offering price. In addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market prices of our securities, regardless of our trading performance.\nIn the past, shareholders often have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 81564, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "IBKC"}
