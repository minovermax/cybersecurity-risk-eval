{"cik": "1057379", "company": "HACKETT GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to risks. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or printed elsewhere by management from time to time.\nOur results of operations could be negatively affected by global and regional economic conditions.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions may affect our clients\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. A substantial or prolonged economic downturn, weak or uncertain economic conditions or similar factors could adversely affect our clients\u2019 financial condition which may reduce our clients\u2019 demand for our services, force price reductions, cause project cancellations, or delay consulting services for which they have engaged us. For example, the recent coronavirus outbreak has created uncertainty in the global economy and could result in a reduction in spending on our services. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate the changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in any given year and should not be used to predict future performance. In future quarters, our operating results may not meet analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations. If that happens, the price of our common stock may fall. Many factors can cause fluctuations in our financial results, including:\n\u2022\nnumber, size, timing and scope of client engagements;\n\u2022\ncustomer concentration;\n\u2022\nlong and unpredictable sales cycles;\n\u2022\ncontract terms of client engagements;\n\u2022\ndegrees of completion of client engagements;\n\u2022\nclient engagement delays or cancellations;\n\u2022\ncompetition for and utilization of employees;\n\u2022\nhow well we estimate the resources and effort we need to complete client engagements;\n\u2022\nthe integration of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\npricing changes in the industry;\n\u2022\nforeign currency changes;\n\u2022\nforeign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions specific to business and information technology consulting; and\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions.\nA high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, if we experience unanticipated changes in client engagements or in consultant utilization rates, we could experience large variations in quarterly operating results and losses in any particular quarter. Due to these factors, we believe our quarter-to-quarter operating results should not be used to predict future performance.\nIf we are unable to maintain our reputation and expand our brand name recognition, we may have difficulty attracting new business and retaining current clients and employees.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining clients and employees in our industry. We also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will continue to increase due to the number of providers of business consulting and IT services. If our reputation is damaged or if potential clients are not familiar with us or with the solutions we provide, we may be unable to attract new, or retain existing, clients and employees. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective solutions. If clients do not perceive our solutions to be effective or of high quality, our brand name and reputation will suffer. In addition, if solutions we provide have defects, critical business functions of our clients may fail, and we could suffer adverse publicity as well as economic liability.\nWe depend heavily on a limited number of clients.\nWe have derived, and believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients for which we perform large projects. In 2019, our ten largest clients accounted for 22% of our aggregate revenue. In addition, revenue from a large client may constitute a significant portion of our total revenue in any particular quarter. Our customer contracts generally can be cancelled for convenience by the customer upon 30 days\u2019 notice. The loss of any of our large clients for any reason,\nincluding as a result of the acquisition of that client by another entity, our failure to meet that client\u2019s expectations, the client\u2019s decision to reduce spending on projects, or failure to collect amounts owed to us from our client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have risks associated with potential acquisitions or investments.\nSince our inception, we have expanded through acquisitions. In the future, we plan to pursue additional acquisitions as opportunities arise. We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses which we may acquire in the future without substantial expense, delays or other operational or financial problems. We may not be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses. Also, acquisitions may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain existing clients;\n\u2022\nunanticipated events or circumstances;\n\u2022\nunknown claims or liabilities;\n\u2022\namortization of certain acquired intangible assets; and\n\u2022\noperating in new or unfamiliar geographies.\nClient dissatisfaction or performance problems at a single acquired business could have a material adverse impact on our reputation as a whole. Further, we cannot assure you that our future acquired businesses will generate anticipated revenue or earnings.\nDifficulties in integrating businesses we acquire in the future may demand time and attention from our senior management.\nIntegrating businesses that we acquire in the future may involve unanticipated delays, costs and/or other operational and financial problems. In integrating acquired businesses, we may not achieve expected economies of scale or profitability or realize sufficient revenue to justify our investment. If we encounter unexpected problems as we try to integrate an acquired firm into our business, our management may be required to expend time and attention to address the problems, which would divert their time and attention from other aspects of our business.\nOur markets are highly competitive.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. The business consulting and IT services markets are highly competitive. We expect competition to further intensify as these markets continue to evolve. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, longer relationships with their clients, greater brand or name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements and to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their services. Competitors could lower their prices, potentially forcing us to lower our prices and suffer reduced operating margins. We face competition from international accounting firms; international, national and regional strategic consulting and systems implementation firms; and the IT services divisions of application software firms.\nIn addition, there are relatively low barriers for entry into the business consulting and IT services market. We do not own any patented technology that would stop competitors from entering this market and providing services similar to ours. As a result, the emergence of new competitors may pose a threat to our business. Existing or future competitors may develop and offer services that are superior to, or have greater market acceptance, than ours, which could significantly decrease our revenue and the value of your investment.\nWe may not be able to hire, train, motivate, retain and manage professional staff.\nTo succeed, we must hire, train, motivate, retain and manage highly skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees who can perform the services we offer is intense. We might not be able to hire enough skilled employees or train, motivate, retain and manage the employees we hire. This could hinder our ability to complete existing client engagements and bid for new ones. Hiring, training, motivating, retaining and managing employees with the skills we need is time-consuming and expensive.\nWe could lose money on our contracts.\nAs part of our strategy, from time to time, we enter into capped or fixed-price contracts, in addition to contracts based on payment for time and materials. Because of the complexity of many of our client engagements, accurately estimating the cost, scope and duration of a particular engagement can be a difficult task. We maintain an Office of Risk Management (\u201cORM\u201d) that evaluates\nand attempts to mitigate delivery risk associated with complex projects. In connection with their review, ORM analyzes the critical estimates associated with these projects. If we fail to make these estimates accurately, we could be forced to devote additional resources to these engagements for which we will not receive additional compensation. To the extent that an expenditure of additional resources is required on an engagement, this could reduce the profitability of, or result in a loss on, the engagement. We may be unsuccessful in negotiating with clients regarding changes to the cost, scope or duration of specific engagements. To the extent we do not sufficiently communicate to our clients, or our clients fail to adequately appreciate the nature and extent of any of these types of changes to an engagement, our reputation may be harmed, and we may suffer losses on an engagement.\nLack of detailed written contracts could impair our ability to recognize revenue for services performed, collect fees, protect our IP and protect ourselves from liability to others.\nWe protect ourselves by entering into detailed written contracts with our clients covering the terms and contingencies of the client engagement. In some cases, however, consistent with what we believe to be industry practice, work is performed for clients on the basis of a limited statement of work or verbal agreement before a detailed written contract can be finalized. To the extent that we fail to have detailed written contracts in place, our ability to collect fees, protect our IP and protect ourselves from liability to others may be impaired.\nOur corporate governance provisions may deter a financially attractive takeover attempt.\nProvisions of our charter and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition which shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders would receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nshareholders must comply with advance notice requirements before raising a matter at a meeting of shareholders or nominating a director for election;\n\u2022\nour Board of Directors is staggered into three classes and the members may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote;\n\u2022\nwe would not be required to hold a special meeting to consider a takeover proposal unless holders of more than a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter were to submit a written demand or demands for us to do so; and\n\u2022\nour Board of Directors may, without obtaining shareholder approval, classify and issue up to 1,250,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, preferences, designations and rights that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nWe may lose large clients or may not be able to secure targeted follow-on work or achieve expected client retention rates.\nOur client engagements are generally short-term arrangements, and most clients can reduce or cancel their contracts for our services with a 30 days\u2019 notice and without penalty. As a result, if we lose a major client or large client engagement, our revenue will be adversely affected. We perform varying amounts of work for specific clients from year to year. A major client in one year may not use our services in another year. In addition, we may derive revenue from a major client that constitutes a large portion of total revenue for particular quarters. If we lose any major clients or any of our clients cancel programs or significantly reduce the scope of a large engagement, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Also, if we fail to collect a large accounts receivable balance, we could be subjected to significant financial exposure. Consequently, you should not predict or anticipate our future revenue based upon the number of clients we currently have or the number and size of our existing client engagements.\nWe also derive a portion of our revenue from annual memberships for our Executive Advisory Programs. Our growth prospects therefore depend on our ability to achieve and sustain renewal rates on programs and to successfully launch new programs. Failure to achieve expected renewal rate levels or to successfully launch new programs and services could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to protect our IP rights or infringe on the IP rights of third parties, our business may be harmed.\nWe rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license IP. Although we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and limit distribution of proprietary information, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our IP, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our IP rights.\nAlthough we believe that our services do not infringe on the IP rights of others and that we have all rights necessary to utilize the IP employed in our business, we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third-party IP rights. Any claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, develop non-infringing IP or acquire licenses to the IP that is the subject of asserted infringement.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to:\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions or technological innovations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts; or\n\u2022\ncurrent market volatility.\nIn addition, the stock prices of many business and technology services companies fluctuate widely for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results. Fluctuation in the market price of our common stock may impact our ability to finance our operations and retain personnel.\nWe earn revenue, incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies, and currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have international operations, where we earn revenue and incur costs in various foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, and the Euro. Doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas, including revenue, purchases, payroll and investments. Certain foreign currency exposures are naturally offset within an international business unit, because revenue and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency, and certain cash balances are held in U.S. Dollar denominated accounts. However, due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our results.\nOur cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls. However, those balances are generally available in the local jurisdiction without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. Any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact the availability and amount of these funds available for transfer.\nThe U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including implications for the free flow of labor and goods in the U.K. and the E.U. and other financial, legal, tax and trade implications. Brexit could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business in the U.K, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. In addition, developments regarding Brexit may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers, particularly those who do business in the U.K., to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services.\nWe rely on information management systems and any damage, interruption or compromise of our information management systems or data could disrupt and harm our business.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information in connection with the operation of our business. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to our company. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Our information management systems and the data contained therein may be vulnerable to damage, including interruption due to power loss, system and network failures, operator negligence and similar causes.\nIn addition, our systems and data may be subject to security breaches, viruses, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks. Cybersecurity attacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our information technology systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production\ndowntimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any significant compromise of our information management systems or data could impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in negative consequences including loss of revenue, fines, penalties, litigation, reputational damage, inability to accurately and/or timely complete required filings with government entities including the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service, unavailability or disclosure of confidential information (including personal information) and negative impact on our stock price.\nData privacy and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks.\nWe collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. We operate in an environment in which data privacy regulatory and legal framework is evolving quickly and varies by jurisdiction. We cannot predict the cost of compliance with future data privacy laws, regulations and standards, or future interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, related to privacy and cybersecurity or the potential effects on our business.\nAs a company doing business in Europe, we are also subject to European data protection laws and regulations. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. In addition, we are also subject to and affected by new state privacy and data security laws such as the recently implemented California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). The CCPA became effective January 1, 2020 and imposes additional data privacy requirements on many businesses operating in the state, including, potentially, with respect to employee data. In addition, already in 2020 several states have introduced varying comprehensive privacy laws modeled to some degree on the CCPA and/or the GDPR. Compliance with multiple country and state laws containing varying requirements could be complicated and costly. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.", "PERMNO": 86048, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "HCKT"}
