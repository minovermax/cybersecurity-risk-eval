{"cik": "1331301", "company": "BOULDER BRANDS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nWe may not be successful in implementing our growth strategy, including without limitation enhancing the recognition and appeal of our brands, increasing distribution of our products across multiple channels, attracting new consumers to our products, and introducing new products and product extensions, either on a timely basis or at all.\nOur future success depends in large part on our ability to implement our growth strategy, including without limitation enhancing our brand recognition, increasing distribution of our products within existing channels and new channels, attracting new consumers to our brands, and introducing new products and product extensions. Our ability to implement our growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to develop new products, acquire additional product lines and businesses, secure shelf space in grocery stores and supermarkets, increase customer awareness of our brands, enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third party retailers and other potential distributors of our products, and compete with numerous other companies and products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy and continue to maintain growth in our sales and EBITDA. If we fail to implement our growth strategy, our sales, EBITDA and profitability will be adversely affected.\nIf we do not manage our supply chain effectively, including maintaining a mix of our own manufacturing facilities as well as co-packers who manufacture our products, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe inability of any supplier of raw materials, independent co-packer, third party distributor or warehouse, or our own manufacturing facilities to deliver or perform in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to increase and our profit margins to decrease, especially as it relates to our products that have a short shelf life. Given our rapid growth, broad product portfolio and constant development of new products, we are subject to the risk that our manufacturing capacity-both internal and external-will be insufficient to meet demand for our products, particularly where products can experience rapid consumer acceptance and require us to produce significantly more of particular products than we had anticipated. Constraints within our frozen distribution network could cause delays in shipments and other supply chain complications. We must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory on hand that may slow the flow of future orders and shipments or even result in inventory reaching code date restrictions and become unsalable. If we are unable to produce and effectively distribute sufficient quantities in response to demand for our products, consumers may look to purchase alternative or competitive products. Moreover, if we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to innovate successfully and on a cost-effective basis.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to introduce new products and to successfully renovate our existing products. Success in product development is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, to obtain adequate funding to pay for R&D efforts, to leverage our research and development capabilities, and to utilize our management\u2019s ability to launch new or improved products successfully and on a cost-effective basis. The development and introduction of new products requires substantial R&D and marketing expenditures, which we may not be able to finance or which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not achieve commercial success and gain widespread market acceptance. Product innovation may also result in increased costs resulting from the use of new manufacturing techniques, capital expenditures, new raw materials and ingredients, new product formulas and possibly new co-packers. Some raw materials may be difficult, or impossible, to purchase at prices that we deem acceptable, particularly with respect to innovative products. In addition, typically we have started selling new products in smaller volumes in order to evaluate consumer demand, and it may be difficult to find co-packers who will manufacture small volumes of our new products at a reasonable price. Historically we have sustained losses on new products until they reached a substantial volume of sales. In addition, many new products do not achieve success in the marketplace, due to lack of demand or otherwise. If we are unsuccessful in our product innovation efforts and demand for our products does not materialize as planned, our business could be negatively affected.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to maintain distribution, particularly at key customer accounts, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProduct distribution can be discontinued with little to no notice by our customers. A limited number of retailers and food wholesalers account for a substantial portion of our revenues. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 65% of our gross sales in 2014. Our largest customers are United Natural Foods, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately 17% and 12%, respectively, of our gross sales in 2014. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue their relationships with us. In addition, there is no assurance that our customers will not reduce our shelf space, continue to carry the same number of our products, charge us more for shelf space or shelve our new products. A significant reduction or loss in purchase volume from United Natural Foods, Inc. or Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or other major customers could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate purchase volume while maintaining or growing profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany retailers measure unit sales per store and establish product velocity hurdles to determine whether a product continues to warrant space on the store shelf. Product velocities can be improved by, among other things, decreasing price and increasing promotion. On certain items, the Company could be required to lower prices or increase promotional spend depending on item velocities, both of which can negatively impact profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, notwithstanding lower prices and increased promotional spend, the Company\u2019s products may lose shelf space, potentially giving rise to a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to invest in the health of its brands to prevent erosion of the reputation or appeal of one or more of our leading brands could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nNearly all of our net sales derive from sales of our branded products, and growth in our business has resulted from the strength of our brands. Our financial success is directly dependent on consumer and customer perception of our brands, including Glutino, Udi\u2019s, Smart Balance, Earth Balance, EVOL and Level. The success of our brands may suffer if our marketing plans, marketing spend levels, or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers or if consumer or customer perceptions of our brands or our products change unfavorably. Our results of operations could be negatively affected if the reputation of one or more of our brands suffers damage due to real or perceived quality issues with our products, or if we are found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations.\nSales of our buttery spreads products contribute a significant portion of our profitability and cash flow. A continued reduction in the sale of our Smart Balance buttery spreads products, which is not offset by increased sales of Earth Balance buttery spreads or our other high-growth products, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to remain profitable and achieve future growth.\nApproximately 22% of our gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from sales of our Smart Balance buttery spreads products. There has been a decline in the margarine/buttery spreads category in recent years and generally over the past 30 years. In addition, our gross sales from sales of our Smart Balance buttery spreads products for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 5% less than it was in the prior year and we cannot ensure that this trend will not continue in future years. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to commercialize our buttery spreads products or that any of our buttery spreads products will continue to be accepted in their markets. Because sales of our buttery spreads products have contributed substantially to our profitability and cash flows, continued reductions in sales of these products will have an adverse effect on our profitability and ability to generate cash to fund our product development, R&D efforts or potential acquisitions.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect continued market acceptance and profitability of our buttery spreads products:\n\u2022\nthe introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022changes in consumer preferences among buttery spreads, margarine, butter, olive oil and other products;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer eating and baking habits, including trends toward increased eating outside of the home;\n\u2022\nthe level and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\ncontinued or accelerating decline in the buttery spreads category, particularly the premium segment of the buttery spreads category;\n\u2022\nany unfavorable publicity regarding buttery spread products or similar products;\n\u2022litigation or threats of litigation with respect to these products;\n\u2022the price of the product relative to other competing products;\n\u2022price increases resulting from rising commodity costs;\n\u2022potential capacity constraints concerning certain non-GMO ingredients;\n\u2022any changes in government policies and practices related to our products and markets;\n\u2022regulatory developments affecting the manufacture, marketing or use of these products;\n\u2022new products or technologies which effectively render our buttery spreads products obsolete;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of First Generation Patents or new science or research which undermines the efficacy of our buttery spreads products; and\n\u2022\nadverse decisions or rulings limiting our ability to promote the benefits of our buttery spreads products and technology.\nAdverse developments with respect to the sale of buttery spreads products could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain profitability and achieve our business plan.\nSales of our gluten free products contribute a meaningful and growing portion of our sales. A failure to continue to grow sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to remain profitable and achieve future growth.\nApproximately 50% of our gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from sales of our Udi\u2019s and Glutino gluten free products. There has been rapid growth in the gluten free category over the past few years. We cannot be certain that all of our gluten free products will continue to be accepted in their markets. Because sales of our gluten free products have contributed substantially to our net sales, any meaningful decline in growth trends of gluten free products could have an adverse effect on our overall net sales.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect continued market acceptance and profitability of our gluten free products:\n\u2022\nthe introduction of competitive products, including private label;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nthe entrance into and increased focus on the gluten free market by large consumer packaged goods companies such as General Mills or Nestle and by large direct store delivery (DSD) distributors such as Bimbo Bakeries or Flowers Foods;\n\u2022\nnew science or research which addresses celiac disease or gluten intolerances;\n\u2022\nthe level and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\na decline in the growth of demand for gluten free products;\n\u2022\nany unfavorable publicity regarding gluten free products;\n\u2022\nlitigation or threats of litigation with respect to these products;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively renovate existing products for quality improvement and margin enhancement;\n\u2022\nthe price of the product relative to other competing products;\n\u2022\nprice increases resulting from rising commodity costs;\n\u2022\nany changes in government policies and practices related to our products and markets;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting the manufacture, marketing or use of these products; and\n\u2022\nnew products or technologies which effectively render our gluten free products obsolete;\nAdverse developments with respect to the sale of gluten free products could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain profitability and achieve our business plan.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with operating, maintaining and continuously upgrading our manufacturing facilities. Loss of one or more of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.\nWhile historically we have mainly outsourced the manufacturing of our products to third parties, as a result of our recent acquisitions, we now lease and operate manufacturing facilities which produce approximately 78% of the products sold by our Natural segment. This subjects us to the risks associated with operating, and the capital expenditures necessary to maintain and continue to upgrade, manufacturing facilities and machinery and equipment. We need to maintain and upgrade our manufacturing facilities in order to, among other things, keep up with the demand for our products, retain sufficient capacity to manufacture new products, and increase our margins. If we are unable to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity to keep up with the demand for our products and ensure that our sales and production teams adequately coordinate their planning and production efforts, we risk losing potential product sales due to not having a sufficient amount of available inventory to meet the growing demand for our products.\nAny loss of the use of all or a portion of any of our facilities due to accidents, fires, explosions, labor issues, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms and earthquakes, supply interruptions, transportation interruptions, human error, mechanical failure, terrorist acts, power outages, discharges or releases of hazardous substances and other environmental issues, or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations. In particular, any loss of the use of the Denver-based facility where we manufacture our Udi\u2019s gluten free products and a portion of our Glutino gluten free products, or any loss of the use of the Canadian facility where we manufacture most of our Glutino gluten free products, would have a material adverse effect on us. We also only have one manufacturing facility for Udi's gluten free bread, and any loss of the use of this facility would have an adverse effect on our business as well. Any loss of the use of all or a portion of any of our facilities could result in substantial business losses, production delays, third party lawsuits and significant repair costs, as well as personal injury and/or loss of life, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows.\nMoreover, unexpected failures of our equipment and machinery could result in production delays, revenue loss and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to our employees. In some cases facilities are designated for certain types of products based on the unique equipment involved and it is more difficult, or impossible, for us to shift production of these products among our facilities. Our Boulder facility, which produces a significant portion of our EVOL and Udi\u2019s frozen items, utilizes equipment and machinery that may require significant repair or upgrading. Any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation and could require significant lead time replacing, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. A loss or interruption of production at certain of our facilities could disrupt our operations and affect a large number of customers, decreasing our revenues. The operation of manufacturing facilities also requires us to hire, train and evaluate large numbers of production employees, which involves additional labor and employment related risks and uncertainties.\nWe are also subject to losses associated with equipment shutdowns, which may be caused by the loss or interruption of electrical power to our facilities due to unusually high demand, blackouts, adverse weather, equipment failure or other catastrophic events. Losses caused by disruptions in the supply of electrical power could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows.\nFinally, our ownership and operation of manufacturing facilities require us to incur potentially significant capital and other expenditures from time to time to maintain those facilities and, where necessary, expand and upgrade those facilities to satisfy demand for our existing products, in connection with the introduction of new products and to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including requirements of the FDA and USDA.\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturers to manufacture all of our Balance segment products and a growing portion of the products sold in our Natural segment. The loss of a manufacturer or the inability of a manufacturer to fulfill our orders or to maintain the quality of our products could adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of product or result in product recalls.\nWe are dependent on third parties to manufacture all of our spreads and a growing portion of the products sold in our Natural segment. The ability of any of our manufacturers to produce our products could be affected by catastrophic events. In particular, we face risks of disruption to our production and sales processes where we rely on only one or two co-packers to manufacturer certain of our products. For example, we currently rely on and may continue to rely on two manufacturers to produce all of our spreads. If either manufacturer were unable or unwilling to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner or renew contracts with us, we would have to identify and qualify new manufacturers, which we may be unable to do. Similarly, we rely on a single co-packer for manufacturing our Smart Balance peanut butter, and several other Smart Balance products are sourced from a single supplier. From time to time, we may have to seek new manufacturers and suppliers or enter into new arrangements with existing ones. However, only a limited number of manufacturers may have the ability to produce our products at the volumes we need, and it could take a significant period of time to locate and qualify such alternative production sources. Moreover, it may be difficult or expensive to find co-packers to produce small volumes of our new products. Co-packers may impose minimum order requirements and any failure on our part to meet these requirements could increase our costs. In addition, we may be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms with our existing or new co-packers as favorable as those we currently enjoy.\nThere can be no assurance that we would be able to identify and qualify new manufacturers in a timely manner or that such manufacturers could allocate sufficient capacity in order to meet our requirements, which could materially adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of product. In addition, there can be no assurance that the capacity of our current manufacturers will be sufficient to fulfill our orders and any supply shortfall could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly in our growing frozen foods business. Currently, some of our products\nare produced by a single third party source maintaining only one facility. The risks of interruption are exacerbated with respect to these single source, single facility manufacturers.\nShipments to and from the warehouses or from overseas on certain ingredients could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including system failures, weather conditions, strikes, shipping delays and capacity constraints. Any significant delay in the shipments of ingredients and products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause our sales and earnings to fluctuate during a particular period or periods. We have from time to time experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in the production and delivery of product or key ingredients.\nOur manufacturers are required to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our Product Manual specifications and requirements for certain certifications. In addition, our manufacturers are required to comply with all federal, state and local laws with respect to food safety. However, there can be no assurance that our manufacturers will continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards or in compliance with applicable laws, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify instances in which our manufacturers fail to comply with our standards or applicable laws. We would have the same issue with new suppliers. We have occasionally received, and may from time to time receive, shipments of products that fail to conform to our standards. The failure of any manufacturer to produce products that conform to our standards could materially and adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and result in product recalls, product liability claims and severe economic loss.\nWe also face risks of losing control of our intellectual property when co-packers require access to our formulas and trade secrets as a condition to doing business with us. For example, if we qualify a co-packer for dual sourcing on our gluten free baked goods, we face the risk of sharing our trade secrets with the co-packer.\nOur business model relies heavily on the skill set, experience, industry knowledge and industry contacts of our executive management team. The departure of one or more members of our executive management team could be disruptive, adversely affect our entrepreneurial culture and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe business model we operate requires specialized skill sets to operate and manage both internal and external teams and operating entities in an efficient coordinated effort. There is a limited available talent pool for these skill sets. If we experience turnover in our executive management ranks there can be no assurance that we can smoothly transition replacements in a timely and efficient manner. Unique skill sets and industry contacts may be difficult or in some instances impossible to duplicate. Disruption to our organization as a result of executive management turnover may have a detrimental impact on our ability to maintain our business performance on a consistent level and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAs a result of our rapid growth over the past few years, we need to continue developing an infrastructure and workforce sufficient to meet the growing demands for our products.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in the past few years, with our net sales growing from $461.3 million in 2013 to $516.6 million in 2014. In particular, we have shifted from a company primarily focused on selling a single brand (i.e., Smart Balance), with products manufactured by co-packers, to a company with a broad portfolio of multiple brands, serving multiple consumer needs, some manufactured by our own facilities and others produced by third parties.\nRapid growth involves various risks related to ensuring that our infrastructure and personnel are sufficient to meet the growing demand for our products. For example, we must seek to identify our personnel needs in light of expected demand for our products, and we will need to identify, recruit, train and retain qualified employees in order to serve this anticipated demand, in all areas of the company\u2019s operations. Because we may hire additional employees in order to meet potential future needs, in order to insure that our sales growth does not outgrow our infrastructure, we may experience higher levels of cost of goods sold and lower overall profitability as we build this infrastructure. Moreover, as we grow and add additional layers of management, process and bureaucracy into our governing structure, we risk losing qualified employees and members of management who were attracted to the company\u2019s entrepreneurial culture but who may not want to remain at a larger company. As we transition our operations and customer service teams from our New Jersey office to our Colorado headquarters, we face certain transition-related risks, such as employees separating from the Company before new employees are adequately trained to assume the necessary responsibilities.\nIn addition, with sales and demand growing rapidly, we need to ensure that we have sufficient manufacturing and warehousing capacity, both internal and via third parties, to meet actual and potential demand for our products. This could require us to make significant capital expenditure investments in order to make sure we have sufficient manufacturing and warehousing capacity. Given our limited funds available for capital expenditures, it will be incumbent upon our management\nto carefully evaluate and correctly select the most important and profitable capital expenditures projects. If growth does not materialize as planned, these large investments could increase our cost of goods sold.\nWe also need to make sure that our information systems are constantly updated and integrated throughout our business, which can be costly and time-consuming, that we have sufficient information technology personnel to manage our growing IT infrastructure, and that our systems generate sufficient information and reports so that our management team can better anticipate future business needs. As we grow, we may decide in the future to install a new company-wide information technology system. Any future migration to a new company-wide information technology system would be costly and potentially disruptive to our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in all of these efforts, and any failure to maintain sufficient infrastructure and personnel will have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to grow and improve its profitability.\nWe rely on Acosta, Inc. and Presence Marketing, Inc. to act as our primary sales agents for a significant portion of our products and there could be significant disruption in our ability to sell products to our customers for a substantial portion of our sales if our relationship with either sales agent is terminated.\nAcosta, Inc. and Presence Marketing, Inc. represent a significant portion of our product line to thousands of supermarkets and food stores. There are a very limited number of national brokers. Our agreements with Acosta and Presence Marketing are terminable by either us or Acosta or Presence Marketing, respectively, after satisfaction of a short notice period. The termination of either agreement would require us to seek other sales agents, likely causing significant disruption to our business, and could affect our relationships with our customers. New sales agents would also potentially face conflicts of interest with respect to their existing customers.\nChanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe natural foods industry in general, and the need-state specific industries (including the gluten free industry) in particular, are subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the food and gluten free industries change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced demand and price reductions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These trends may require use of certain specialized ingredients that may be more difficult to source and entail higher costs, which we may not be able to pass on to customers. Factors that may affect consumer tastes and preferences include dietary trends and attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, concerns regarding the health effects and sourcing practices relating to specific ingredients and nutrients, a shift in preference from non-organic to organic, from GMO to non-GMO, and from non-natural products to natural products, the availability of competing private label products offered by retailers, trends toward eating and baking outside of the home, concerns regarding the public health consequences associated with obesity, and increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production. Consumer perceptions of the nutritional profile of gluten free products may shift, and consumers may prefer food products with fewer carbohydrates, higher levels of protein and additional fiber. Consumer preferences may shift among buttery spreads, margarine, butter, olive oil, coconut and other products. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their needs and preferences on a timely and affordable basis. If consumer demand for our products declines, our sales and business would be negatively affected.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms.\nWe may require more capital in the future to fund our operations, finance investments in equipment and infrastructure, enhance and expand the range of products we offer, and respond to potential strategic opportunities, such as investments, acquisitions and international expansion. Our business has become more capital-intensive in recent years and our capital expenditures have increased significantly compared to prior periods, both to keep up with demand for our products and to improve our margins. We can give no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. The terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to reduce our operations or delay, limit or abandon expansion opportunities. Moreover, even if we are able to continue our operations, the failure to obtain additional financing could reduce our competitiveness.\nCurrent pricing levels or future price increases could result in a loss of consumer loyalty and sales.\nFrom time to time we may elect to increase or decrease the prices of certain of our products, either in response to competitor actions or for other business purposes, including commodity cost increases. Price increases or failure to decrease pricing could result in a loss of consumer loyalty, potentially leading to lower volumes and sales. As consumers become increasingly price sensitive, there can be no assurance that any price increases we may effectuate will not result in a loss to us of consumers and market share or that we will be able to maintain our sales volumes as prices increase.\nOur business depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property effectively. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends substantially on the legal protection of proprietary rights in intellectual property that we own or license. We also claim proprietary rights in various unpatented technologies, know-how, trade secrets (including formulas) and trademarks relating to our products and manufacturing processes. Our ability to implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to expand brand recognition using trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos. If existing contractual measures fail to protect our proprietary rights, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property (including, by reverse-engineering our products), any advantage those proprietary rights provide may be negated and the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. Moreover, as we move into new and additional distribution channels for our products, such as foodservice, and as we seek to establish relationships with additional co-packers for our gluten free products, and as we manage through turnover of employees over time, it may become increasingly difficult or impossible for us to fully protect our intellectual property (including trade secrets) and knowhow.\nMonitoring infringement of intellectual property rights is difficult and we cannot be certain that the precautions we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and know-how, particularly in countries where we do not have trademarks or patents at all or where the laws of such country may not protect our proprietary rights as adequately as the laws of the United States or at all. Accordingly, other parties, including competitors, may duplicate our products using our proprietary technologies.\nPursuing legal remedies against persons infringing on our patents or otherwise improperly using our proprietary information is a costly and time-consuming process that would divert management's attention and other resources from the conduct of our business, which could cause delays and other problems with the marketing and sales of our products, as well as delays in deliveries. We have commenced legal actions against third parties infringing on the patents in the past and may commence similar legal actions in the future. When we seek to enforce our patents, defendants are permitted to raise issues like prior art which could have the impact of invalidating or limiting the claims of our owned or licensed patents which may cause harm to our image, brand or competitive position. In addition, patent infringement cases can involve hearings in which the court determines the boundaries of the patent in dispute, which could limit the utility of our patents.\nWe rely on a combination of common law trademark rights, U.S. and Canadian federal registration rights, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce our trademark rights for current products or register trademarks or obtain common law trademark rights using \u201cSmart Balance,\u201d \u201cEarth Balance,\u201d \u201cGlutino,\u201d \u201cUdi's,\u201d \u201cEVOL\u201d or \u201cLevel\u201d for any new product lines we may introduce. The inability to have the exclusive right to use these terms in new product names could weaken our ability to create strong brands in existing and new product categories and could dilute the value of our trademarks. As we expand our product lines, we may need to apply for additional trademark protection. We are currently involved in several trademark opposition proceedings involving the registration of the Smart Balance and Earth Balance marks in new categories. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these proceedings may hamper our ability to expand into desired categories as part of our overall growth plan.\nIn addition, in 2007, three parties filed Oppositions to European Patent No. 820,307 relating to increasing the HDL level and the HDL/LDL ratio in Human Serum by Balancing Saturated and Polyunsaturated Dietary Fatty Acids. A written decision of the panel ruled against the Company and we have filed an appeal. We believe that neither this proceeding, nor its outcome, will have a material adverse effect on our current business.\nAlthough we rely in part on common law trademarks to protect our proprietary rights, common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection as afforded by the United States federal registration of a trademark. Common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used, plus a reasonable zone of future expansion, while U.S. federal registration on the Principal Register provides the registrant with superior rights throughout the United States, subject to certain exceptions.\nTo the extent that we have registered our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions where our products are or may be sold, the protection available in such jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection available in the United States. Additionally, we may be unable to register the \u201cSmart Balance,\u201d \u201cEarth Balance,\u201d \u201cGlutino,\u201d \u201cUdi's,\u201d \u201cEVOL\u201d or \u201cLevel\u201d trademarks for the products that we may want to sell in certain markets, which could adversely affect our ability to expand into any such countries.\nThe expiration of the First Generation Patents we license from Brandeis University in the United States may result in the loss of one of our key competitive advantages in the buttery spreads category, which could result in a material adverse effect on revenue and spreads volume.\nThe First Generation Patents we license from Brandeis in the United States are set to expire in April of 2015, together with the related rights the Company has in the United States under its license agreement with Brandeis. Following the expiration of the First Generation Patents, the Company's ability to maintain market share in the spreads category will be largely dependent on overall brand strength, marketing efforts and development and incorporation of new technologies and failure to do so effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and condition.\nAny sustained economic downturn in the U.S., Canada and abroad and related consumer sentiment could make it more difficult to sell our premium priced products and may have a detrimental impact on our third-party manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and customers, which could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny sustained difficult economic conditions in the U.S., Canada and abroad would negatively impact us in several ways. First, high unemployment, loss of savings and retirement funds, and declines in the housing market, can lead to a lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally. Economic pressures and/or negative consumer sentiment may result in consumers purchasing less expensive alternatives and could make it more difficult to sell our premium priced products, convince shoppers to switch to our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. Second, one or more of our manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and customers may experience cash flow problems and, therefore, such manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and customers may be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which in some cases would make it difficult for us to continue production of certain products, could require us to reduce sales of our products or could result in uncollectable accounts receivable. Financial difficulties or solvency problems at these manufacturers, suppliers and distributors could materially adversely affect their ability to supply us with products, which could disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement for certain manufacturers, suppliers or distributors without significant delay or increase in cost. Any negative effect on the ability of consumers to purchase our premium products, or any interruption of our manufacturing, supply chain or distribution for any reason (including but not limited to financial distress, natural disaster or production difficulties), could substantially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations and volatility in various food and supply costs as well as increased costs associated with product processing and transportation could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nBoth we and our third party manufacturers obtain most of the key ingredients used in our products from third-party suppliers. As with most food products, the availability and cost of raw materials used in our products can be significantly affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, growing decisions, government programs (including government programs and mandates relating to ethanol), weather conditions such as frosts, drought, and floods, and plant diseases, pests and other acts of nature. Because we do not control the production of raw materials, we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production of raw materials based on conditions not within our control. Such conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, natural disasters, palm oil sustainability issues and boycotts of products or other catastrophic events. As a result, we are not assured of continued supply, pricing, or exclusive access to raw materials from any of our suppliers.\nThere can be no assurance that we or our manufacturers will be able to obtain alternative sources of raw materials at favorable prices, or at all, should there be shortages or other unfavorable conditions. In some instances, we enter into forward purchase commitments to secure the costs of projected commodity requirements needed to produce our finished goods. These commitments are stated at a firm price, or as a discount or premium from a future commodity price and are placed with our manufacturers or directly with ingredient/packaging suppliers. There can be no assurance that our pricing commitments will result in the lowest available cost for the commodities used in our products.\nIn addition, not all of the commodities that we need for our products can be hedged. For example, a key raw material in the production of gluten free bread is egg whites. Egg whites cannot be hedged in the current market and we are subject\nto volatility in the pricing of egg whites. As we expand our business into new product categories, we may not be able to hedge the prices of all of the commodities which we need for our business at reasonable prices or at all.\nOne of our key raw materials is palm fruit oil. We currently obtain palm fruit oil from multiple responsible sources in Malaysia, West Africa and South America. Any inability to obtain responsibly-sourced palm fruit oil, whether due to political instability in the regions where we source it or otherwise, or an increase in the cost of palm fruit oil for any reason, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, energy is required to process and produce our products. Transportation costs, including fuel and labor, also impact the cost of manufacturing our products. These costs fluctuate significantly over time due to factors that may be beyond our control.\nOur inability or our manufacturers' inabilities to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products or energy at favorable prices, or at all, as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could cause an increase in our cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin, or cause our sales and earnings to fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. There is no assurance that we would be able to pass along any cost increases to our customers.\nOur advertising is regulated for accuracy, and if our advertising is determined to be false or misleading, we may face fines or sanctions.\nOur advertising is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits dissemination of false or misleading advertising. In addition, the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., which we refer to as NAD, administers a self-regulatory program of the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising. NAD both monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competing companies and consumers. Should our advertising be determined to be false or misleading, we may have to pay damages, withdraw our campaign and possibly face fines or sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nAdverse publicity or consumer concern regarding the safety and quality of food products or health concerns, whether with our products or for food products in the same food group as our products, may result in the loss of sales.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumers' perception of the safety, quality and possible dietary benefits of our products. As a result, substantial negative publicity concerning one or more of our products or other foods and beverages similar to or in the same food group as our products could lead to a loss of consumer confidence in our products, removal of our products from retailers' shelves and reduced sales and prices of our products. Product quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could hurt the image of our brands and cause consumers to choose other products. Further, any product recall, whether our own or by a third party within one of our categories, whether due to real or unfounded allegations, could damage our brand image and reputation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we conduct operations in a market segment that suffers a loss in consumer confidence as to the safety and quality of food and beverage products, our business could be materially adversely affected. The food industry has recently been subject to negative publicity concerning the health implications of genetically modified organisms, or \u201cGMO's,\u201d obesity, trans fat, diacetyl, artificial growth hormones, arsenic in rice and bacterial contamination, such as salmonella and aflatoxin. Consumers may increasingly require that foods meet stricter standards than are required by applicable governmental agencies, which would increase the cost of manufacturing such foods and ingredients. Developments in any of these areas including, but not limited to, a negative perception about our proprietary formulations, could cause our operating results to differ materially from expected results. Any of these events could harm our sales, increase our costs and hurt our operating results, perhaps significantly.\nThe food industry has been experiencing a significant trend in which an increasing number of consumers are requiring only non-GMO and other specialized ingredients in their foods. Legislation could also require companies to move to non-GMO labeling or other higher cost ingredients. This could result in changes to our labeling, advertising and/or packaging or require us to purchase non-GMO ingredients, which would increase our costs. Sourcing non-GMO (and other specialized) ingredients increases costs because non-GMO (and other specialized) ingredients and raw materials are generally less widely available and therefore more expensive and we may not be able to increase our prices to reflect this increased cost. Companies that fail to source non-GMO (and other specialized) ingredients could, over time, lose market share and face decreasing sales. As additional retailers require or consider requiring all of their products to be non-GMO, additional pressure may come to\nbear on manufacturers to find sources of raw materials which are non-GMO. This may be particularly difficult in the United States, where most farmers produce genetically modified foods, causing it to be difficult to source non-GMO ingredients and raw materials. There is also a risk of contamination of non-GMO farms by neighboring GMO farms. Our second biggest customer, Walmart, does not currently sell only non-GMO foods, but this could change in the future. As a result, the trend toward non-GMO products could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly as we pursue additional business in Europe and outside the United States.\nWe have no long-term contracts with our customers which require the purchase of a minimum amount of our products. The absence of long-term contracts could result in periods during which we must continue to pay costs and service indebtedness without current revenues or with reduced revenues.\nAs is generally the case in the retail consumer goods industry, our customers do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments. As a result of the absence of long-term contracts, we could have periods during which we have no or only limited orders for our products, but we will continue to have to pay our costs including costs to maintain our work force and service our indebtedness, without the benefit of current revenues or with reduced revenues. We cannot ensure that we will be able to timely find new customers to supplement periods where we experience no or limited purchase orders or that we can recover fixed costs as a result of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of no or limited purchase orders for our products could have a material adverse effect on our net income, cause us to incur losses or result in violations of the debt covenants contained in our Credit Facility (as defined below).\nConversely, we are increasingly selling products to distributors who sell our products to retailers, particularly in the Natural segment, and we may experience unanticipated increased orders for our products from these distributors which are not correlated to consumer demand. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements by our distributor customers could result in fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter.\nOur performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the U.S. and abroad.\nOur performance is affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad. Such conditions and factors include changes in applicable laws and regulations, including changes in food and drug laws, accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws. Other factors impacting our operations include recessionary conditions, the performance of businesses in hyperinflationary environments, terrorist acts and political unrest. Such changes could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition. In addition, unfavorable general economic conditions could affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, some of our products. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by foregoing purchases of our products or by purchasing lower-priced alternatives from our competitors. Consumers could also choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products, which generally have lower retail prices than do their branded counterparts. In addition, the prices of our key commodities inputs, such as palm oil, soybean oil and egg whites, could fluctuate greatly as a result of economic and political factors.\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our business.\nWe do business in Canada and the United Kingdom, may seek to do more business outside the United States in the future, and also have third-party manufacturers located outside the U.S., and, as such, are subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations as it pertains to the receipt and payment of foreign currencies into or out of U.S. dollars. In some instances, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against currency risks. However, with or without hedging, currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions.\nOne of our strategies is to selectively pursue acquisitions, in order to continue to grow and increase our sales and profitability. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring brands with products that complement our existing product mix and identifying and acquiring brands in new categories and in new geographies for purposes of expanding our business internationally. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acquisitions of identified candidates on terms acceptable to us, or integrate acquisitions that we complete. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and/or adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions in the future, the risk that we improperly value and price a target, the potential inability to identify all of the risks and liabilities inherent in a target company notwithstanding the Company's due diligence efforts, the diversion of management's attention from the operations of our business and strain\non the Company's existing personnel, increased leverage due to additional debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition, dilution of our stockholders' net current book value per share if we issue additional equity securities to finance an acquisition, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms and the need to obtain regulatory or other governmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions. In addition, any future acquisitions may pose risks associated with entry into new geographic markets, distribution channels, lines of business and/or product categories, where we may not have significant or any prior experience and where we may not be as successful or profitable as we are in businesses and geographic regions where we have greater familiarity and brand recognition. Potential acquisitions may also entail significant transaction costs and require a significant amount of management time, even where we are unable to consummate or decide not to pursue a particular transaction.\nIn addition, even when acquisitions are completed, integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties, such as failure to achieve financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition, strain on the Company's personnel, systems, supply chain network and operational and managerial controls and procedures, the need to modify systems or to add management resources, difficulties in the integration and retention of customers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies, amortization of acquired assets (which would reduce future reported earnings), possible adverse short-term effects on inventory levels, cash flows or operating results, diversion of management's attention from the operations of our business, integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures, coordinating sales and marketing functions and failure to obtain and retain key personnel of an acquired business. Failure to manage these acquisition growth risks could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe may fail to realize the revenue enhancements and other benefits expected from our acquisitions.\nSince August 2011, we have acquired Glutino and Udi's, manufacturers and marketers of gluten free products; Davies, a United Kingdom based gluten free bakery and bread manufacturer; 89% of Level Life foods, which produces foods for diabetes-friendly diets; and EVOL Foods, a manufacturer of frozen foods from pure and simple ingredients. The success of these acquisitions and other acquisitions we may make in the future will depend, in part, on our ability to improve and maintain their gross margin, expand and maintain their product offerings, increase and maintain their distribution, leverage our infrastructure, maintain or accelerate their sales growth, realize anticipated synergies and successfully integrate their businesses into our company. If we are not able to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, efforts to integrate the businesses into our company may also divert management attention and resources.\nIssues that may arise in connection with integrating businesses include, among other things:\n\u2022\nintegrating certain distribution, marketing and promotion activities and information systems;\n\u2022integrating and executing appropriate demand and supply chain planning;\n\u2022conforming other companies\u2019 standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies to our own;\n\u2022consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022retaining key management;\n\u2022retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; and\n\u2022making any necessary modifications to acquired entities\u2019 operating control standards to comply with the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate the operations of acquired entities successfully, improve their gross margin, expand their product offerings, increase their distribution, leverage our infrastructure, maintain or accelerate their sales growth, fully realize anticipated synergies from the acquisitions or operate acquired entities as profitably as anticipated. Our beliefs regarding the benefits to be derived from our acquisitions are based on numerous assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could deviate materially from our expectations.\nA large portion of our sales involves the manufacturing of gluten free products, which involve various risks and uncertainties.\nPrior to the Glutino and Udi's acquisitions, we had no experience in the gluten free business and we had no prior manufacturing experience. Our purchases of Glutino and Udi's have resulted in our operating three gluten free manufacturing facilities, which involves the risks inherent in manufacturing. Further, we expect that we will need to increase our capital expenditures in order to keep up with growing demand for our products and to improve our gross margin. In addition, as our gluten free business increases, we will need to locate qualified co-packers with sufficient dedicated space for our gluten free products and contract with them on commercially viable terms, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. In\nsome cases, we rely on a single co-packer for certain products. The use of co-packers increases the risk of a potential loss of control over our intellectual property (including formulas and trade secrets) on co-packed items. We also face the potential loss of control over our intellectual property as we expand into the foodservice channel of distribution, as many of the companies with whom we may enter into business relationships may require ownership of relevant gluten free formulas as a condition to working with us. In addition, as demand for gluten free products grows, we will need to increase our production, both through internal manufacturing and external co-packers, in order to ensure that we have sufficient supply to meet increasing demand. Our failure to successfully operate the gluten free business may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn August of 2013, the FDA issued a new regulation requiring that any food label bearing the claim \u201cgluten free\u201d must contain less than 20 parts per million of gluten or would be deemed misbranded. All food labels bearing the claim \u201cgluten free\u201d were required to be in compliance by August of 2014. Prior to the effective date of the regulation, we enacted measures to ensure compliance with these new regulations, targeting no more than 10 parts per million of gluten as our more aggressive internal standard for Udi\u2019s and Glutino gluten free items. Any single instance of noncompliance with the federal standards could result in products being deemed mislabeled, which could significantly damage the credibility of our gluten free brands, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Our acquisitions of companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur recent acquisitions have significantly increased the number of employees we have, subjecting us to the risks inherent in a larger and broader workforce, including labor disputes and adverse employee relations, which could disrupt our business and increase our costs.\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, the number of employees we have has increased from 70 on June 30, 2011 to approximately 900 as of December 31, 2014. This has significantly changed our workforce from primarily sales and marketing personnel (with co-packers) to a broader workforce including all aspects of manufacturing and production. As a result of our bigger and broader workforce, we are now required to handle a broad range of human resources issues (on a broader scale) involving, among other things, training, quality control, employee evaluations, employee benefits, EEOC claims, compliance policies and federal and state OSHA requirements.\nWhile we believe that our relations with our employees are good, employees at our Glutino manufacturing facility in Laval, Quebec, Canada have formed a labor union and our other employees could in the future seek to form labor unions. These labor unions could seek to enter into collective bargaining arrangements with us, which could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, labor disturbances or other slowdowns by the affected workers. We could experience significant disruption in our operations, particularly in connection with the transition of several employees from Paramus to Boulder, which would cause higher ongoing labor costs and impact our ability to satisfy our customers' requirements. Any such cost increases, stoppages or disturbances could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows by limiting plant production, sales volumes and profitability.\nTo the extent we grow our business outside of the United States, we will face risks associated with conducting business in foreign markets.\nWe currently conduct most of our business in the United States, but our acquisitions of Glutino and Udi's have significantly increased our presence in Canada, our acquisition of Davies has increased our presence in the United Kingdom and we are evaluating the possibility of growing our business in certain other foreign countries. The substantial up-front investment required, the lack of consumer awareness of our products in jurisdictions outside the United States, differences in consumer preferences and trends between the United States and other jurisdictions (involving matters such as GMO and fresh products), the risk of inadequate intellectual property protections, and differences in packaging, labeling, food and related laws, rules and regulations are all substantial matters that need to be evaluated prior to doing business in new territories. To the extent we grow our business outside of the United States, we could be adversely affected by economic, legal, political and regulatory developments in the countries in which we do business in the future or in which we expand our business, particularly those countries which have historically experienced a high degree of political or economic instability.\nExamples of risks inherent in doing business outside of North America include changes in the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, changes in tariffs, the adoption of foreign or domestic laws limiting exports to or imports from certain foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the U.S. dollar, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, expropriation of property without fair compensation, weak protection of intellectual property rights, and the acceptance of business practices which are not consistent with or are antithetical to prevailing business practices we are accustomed to in the United States, including export compliance and anti-bribery practices and governmental sanctions. We may also face difficulties in operations and diversion of management time in connection with establishing our business in countries where we have not operated before.\nDoing business outside the United States will also require us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions which place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations will be subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or \u201cFCPA,\u201d export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or \u201cOFAC.\u201d As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we will be exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, or the \u201cBribery Act,\u201d extends beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also applies to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment.\nLitigation, legal proceedings or tax audits could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation.\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims related to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, the marketing and labeling of products, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. Even when such lawsuits in our judgment have little or no merit, the defense of these lawsuits may be costly and divert our management\u2019s attention. The costs of litigation and resulting settlements, as applicable, can vary from quarter to quarter based on the status of the proceedings and could be material to our results in any given quarter.\nWe evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to state, federal and foreign tax audits. We are not currently undergoing an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, however we do have a pending state audit in process for the tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011. We do not believe that there are any uncertain tax positions related to the state audit. As of December 31, 2014, our 2011 through 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing. As of December 31, 2014, the audits of our Canadian subsidiary's 2011 and 2012 tax returns have been closed with respect to withholding taxes. Our Canadian subsidiary remains under the tax audit with respect to other issues for the 2011 tax year. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in such audits, and failure to prevail could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities, including liabilities arising from litigation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have and in the future may become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, employees and other matters. Some of these claims may relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of the businesses. We maintain insurance to cover certain of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions, deductibles and caps under our insurance. It is possible, however, that judgments\ncould be rendered against us in cases in which we would be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for these matters. Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms in the future, and we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage. Finally, even in cases where we maintain insurance coverage, our insurers may raise various objections and exceptions to coverage that could make uncertain the timing and amount of any possible insurance recovery.\nIncreases in costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nAs the number of our employees has grown, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. These costs can vary substantially as a result of changes in health care laws and costs. These factors may increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases. If we do not succeed, our profitability could be negatively affected. In particular, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, which was amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). The Affordable Care Act is designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, among other objectives. Many aspects of the Affordable Care Act are being implemented through new regulations and regulatory guidance, which are continuing to be issued, which has produced considerable uncertainty as to how significant the increase to the healthcare costs will be and the effect of the plan modifications on the behavior of our employees. While we cannot accurately predict at this time the full effect of the Affordable Care Act on our business, compliance may adversely impact our labor costs, our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefits plans for our employees, our ability to attract or retain employees or our operations to the extent that compliance may affect the composition of our workforce, any or all of which could be costly and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In particular, as we grow, we need to make sure that our information technology systems are upgraded and integrated throughout our business and able to generate reports sufficient for management to run our business. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage, interruption or security breaches from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, system failures, cyber-attacks, corporate espionage, and viruses. Any such damage, interruption or security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $425.0 million of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. The value of these intangible assets depends on a variety of factors, including the success of our business, market conditions, earnings growth and expected cash flows. Impairments to these intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, changes in discount rates based on changes in market interest rates or lower than expected sales and profit growth rates. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires considerable judgment. Significant and unanticipated changes in the value of our reporting units or our intangible assets could require a charge for impairment in a future period that would substantially affect our earnings in the period of such charge.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including reasons not specifically related to our performance, such as industry or market trends, reports by industry analysts and other third parties, investor perceptions, actions by credit rating agencies, negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance or actions taken by our competitors, as well as general economic and industry conditions. For example, to the extent that other companies within our industry experience declines in their stock price, our stock price may decline as well, notwithstanding our company's performance. Our common stock price is also affected by announcements we make about our business, market data that is available to subscribers, analyst reports related to our company, changes in financial\nestimates by analysts, whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our company, rating agency announcements about our business, variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors, general economic and stock market conditions, future sales of our common stock, perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives, the public\u2019s reaction to our public announcements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or \"SEC,\" actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors, and speculation by the investment community regarding our business, among other factors. Our stock price may also be affected by fluctuations in the market share of our products. Our results could also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of fluctuations in orders from distributors, which do not necessarily correlate to consumer demand for our products. In addition, if we fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions or our integration of the acquisitions takes longer than anticipated, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn addition, the market for our common stock is not as large as the market for the common stock of some other public companies, including public companies in the food and beverage industry. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 61.2 million shares of common stock outstanding. Our shares of common stock may be sporadically and/or thinly traded. This may cause investors to have difficulty in gaining liquidity in their shares. Also, as a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares of common stock by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. This may result in volatility in our stock price and could exacerbate the other volatility-inducing factors described above.\nRisks Related to the Food and Beverage Industries\nOur business operations may be subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our operations.\nManufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, the United States Department of Agriculture, and other national, state and local authorities. For example, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act and their regulations govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging and safety of foods and beverages. Under these acts, the FDA regulates manufacturing practices for foods and beverages through its current \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d regulations, imposes ingredient specifications and requirements for many foods and beverages and inspects food and beverage facilities and issues recalls for tainted food and beverage products. Additionally, the USDA has adopted regulations with respect to a national organic labeling and certification program. Food and beverage manufacturing facilities and products are also subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities. State regulations are not always consistent with federal regulations or other state regulations. As we have grown, we have shifted our product mix from products almost exclusively regulated by the FDA to products regulated also by the USDA; this has resulted in a more difficult and complex regulatory environment.\nOur operations are also subject to foreign and provincial regulation and oversight by governmental agencies in the countries in which we operate, including the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom, the European Food Safety Authority in the European Commission, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Ministry of Agriculture in Canada, which regulate the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising and labeling of the products we manufacture, including food safety standards.\nWe are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to competition, product safety, the protection of the environment, and employment and labor practices, and the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are subject to, among others, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, various environmental statutes, as well as various state and local statutes and regulations. Our Canadian manufacturing facilities are also subject to inspection by Canadian federal, provincial and local authorities.\nAny changes in laws and regulations applicable to food and beverage products could increase the cost of developing and distributing our products and otherwise increase the cost of conducting our business, which would materially adversely\naffect our financial condition. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including future laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe growth of our business will rely on our ability to successfully introduce products in numerous new categories and distribution channels. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including future laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, through our acquisitions of Glutino and Udi's, we have expanded our product offerings into the gluten free market, including snack foods, frozen baked goods, frozen entrees, granola, bread and baking mixes, and through our acquisition of EVOL, we have expanded our product offerings into the \u201cconventional\u201d frozen market.\nWe could also be affected by climate change and any regulations implemented to address such concerns. There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns could limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities. We are a large user of palm oil and could be affected by sustainability issues related to rain forests and the impact this would have on palm oil production. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt suppliers or impact demand for our products. In addition, public and governmental expectations or demands for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs.\nWe may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any food or beverage products manufactured or marketed by us cause injury, illness or death. Regardless of whether such claims against us are valid, they may be expensive to defend and may generate negative publicity, both of which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nThe sale of food and beverage products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of bacterial contamination, foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents or residues introduced during production processes. Although we believe that we and our manufacturers are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, if the consumption of our products causes or is alleged to have caused an illness in the future, we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding an illness, injury or death could materially adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers on a permanent basis and our corporate image and operating results. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this nature might not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have. While we have product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be adequate, we cannot be sure that claims or liabilities will be asserted for which adequate insurance will be available or that such claims or liabilities will not exceed the available amount of insurance coverage.\nOur food or beverage products may also experience product tampering, contamination or spoilage or be mislabeled or otherwise damaged. Under certain circumstances a product recall could be initiated, leading to a material adverse effect on our reputation, operations and operating results. Recalls may be required to avoid seizures or civil or criminal litigation or due to market demands. Even if such a situation does not necessitate a recall, product liability claims could be asserted against us. A product liability judgment or a product recall involving us or a third party within one of our categories could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and could impair the perception of our brands for an extended period of time.\nOur manufacturing facilities will need to comply with regulatory requirements, and we are also dependent on our third party manufacturers for compliance with sound and lawful production of many of our products. Even if we have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liabilities relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and brand image.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations, which could have a detrimental effect on our performance. A judgment that is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our results.\nThe food and beverage industry has been subject to a growing number of claims, including class action lawsuits based on the nutritional content of food products as well as disclosure and advertising practices. We are currently facing and in the future may continue to face these types of claims and proceedings and, even if we are successful in defending these claims, publicity about these matters may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results. In addition, suits against our competitors can harm our business. These types of class action lawsuits can also make it more difficult for us to market our products, by restricting our ability to differentiate our products from other products on the market. Furthermore, the defense of class action lawsuits can result in significant costs, which are often times not covered by insurance, can be time consuming and can divert the attention of management from other matters relating to our business.\nSuccessful new product introductions are important to sustaining or growing our business and there is no guarantee that customers will accept or set reasonable prices for our products. Even where customers accept our products, the Company still must expend resources to create consumer awareness and generate interest in our products. In addition, competitors may offer significant price reductions, and we cannot ensure that consumers will find our products suitably differentiated from products of our competitors to justify a higher price.\nThe food industry and retailers in the grocery industry use new products as a way of creating excitement and a variety of choices in order to attract consumers. There is a risk that we will be unable to develop new product technologies to address consumer needs. Even if we identify new innovations, the cost may be prohibitive, the product's taste may not meet consumer standards, there may be high introductory costs, we may have limited financial resources available for new product launches, there may be regulatory restrictions on the production and advertising of our new products, and our new products may take away sales from other of our products. In addition, underperformance on new product launches can damage overall brand credibility with customers and consumers.\nOur ability to develop, market, and sell new products at an appropriate price may be hampered by unfavorable terms of sale imposed by our customers, the inability to get shelf space for our products at a reasonable cost or, once placed, the failure to have an attractive price set for our products. Competitors, many of whom have greater resources than us, vie for the same shelf placement and may offer incentives to the retailers that we cannot match. In addition, unattractive shelf placement and pricing may put us at a disadvantage to our competitors.\nFurthermore, there is a trend among retailers in the grocery industry to reduce the overall number of products offered in their stores, which further increases competition for shelf space and makes it more difficult for us to keep existing products on the shelf and introduce new products with these retailers. Even if we do obtain shelf placement, our new and existing products may fail to achieve the sales expectations set by our retailers, potentially causing these retailers to remove our products from the shelf. As companies face more pressure for shelf space within each category, the increase in the number and quality of private label products continues to affect branded products. Gluten free private label offerings could also adversely affect our sales.\nIn order to obtain and keep shelf placement for our products, we may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending in order to create consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or to promote new products, which could impact our operating results. The inability to stay current with food and consumer trends through new products could materially adversely affect our business performance.\nIn addition, we constantly evaluate our product lines to determine whether or not to discontinue certain products and whether or not to stay in particular lines of business. Exiting product lines may increase our profitability but could reduce our sales, and a reduction in sales of certain products could result in a reduction in sales of other products. We cannot ensure that the discontinuation of product lines will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, many food retailers are caught between the rising costs of the products they sell and consumers who are demanding lower prices. We are adversely affected by efforts by retailers to increase their margins by increasing the prices of products they sell, over which we have no control, because this can result in some consumers electing to purchase lower-cost alternatives. This is compounded by a shift by retailers to using pricing departments, which are separate from their buyers/merchandisers, so we have less influence over final retailer pricing. The expanding retailer margins make it more difficult for us to offer adequate value to the consumers and create brand loyalty.\nChanges in retail distribution arrangements and the trend toward fewer products stocked at retail can result in the loss of retail shelf space and disrupt sales of food or beverage products, which could cause our sales and/or profitability to fall.\nFrom time to time, retailers change distribution centers that supply some of their retail stores or change sales agencies that are responsible for stocking and maintaining food and beverage products in parts of their stores. If a new distribution\ncenter has not previously distributed our products in that region or if a sales agency is not familiar with our products, there could be a delay in a distribution center's ability to begin distributing our new products in its region or to arrange for a sales agency to represent and stock our products. If we do not get approval to have our products offered in a new distribution region or if getting this approval takes longer than anticipated, our operating results may suffer. Likewise, if we cannot establish a relationship with a sales agent to stock food or beverage products in one or a number of stores or if we temporarily lose shelf space during the time it takes to do so, our sales may decline. In addition, the trend by retailers of reducing the number and inventory of items in stock and on shelf can lead to loss of sales and less availability of our products to consumers.\nThe food industry is highly competitive and we compete with many companies who have greater resources than us.\nThe food industry is highly competitive and numerous multinational, regional and local firms currently compete, or are capable of competing, with us. Our products compete with branded products as well as generic and private-label products of food retailers, wholesalers, food service providers and cooperatives. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, ability to satisfy specific consumer need states (including gluten free needs), brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising, patent protections and price. Some competitors may have different profit or strategic objectives than we do. Some competitors may invest in discounts or trade credit at a time when we are investing in new packaging and promotion, or vice versa. Competitors may develop new patentable technology which results in products which are able to compete successfully with our products. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand's market position or to introduce a new product, and participants in our industry are engaging with new media, including consumer outreach through social media and web-based vehicles.\nIn the Natural segment, our larger competitors now include General Mills (Annie\u2019s), Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (Rudi\u2019s), Hillshire Farms (Van\u2019s), Sch\u00e4r and Amy\u2019s Gluten Free. There are also many smaller companies dedicated to gluten free, allergen-free or other natural products that compete with us, and large companies with superior resources and distributions systems, many smaller niche companies and/or private label sellers could elect to enter the gluten free market. Pricing and margins in gluten free categories may be reduced as private label and competitive activity increases. Our business could be adversely affected if large consumer packaged goods companies such as General Mills or Nestle began to focus on selling low cost gluten free products, or if large direct store delivery (DSD) distributors such as Bimbo Bakeries or Flowers Foods began distributing shelf stable gluten free bread and baked goods through their nationwide distribution channels. We also face the risk that competitors may eventually catch up with us with respect to the taste and quality of the gluten free foods they sell. In our Balance segment, our largest principal competitors are Unilever, ConAgra Foods and Land O' Lakes, each of whom has substantially greater market presence, longer operating histories, better distribution, and greater financial, marketing, capital and other resources than we do. Our ability to gain or maintain market share may be limited as a result of actions by competitors or by the limited advertising and promotional resources available to us. If our products fail to compete successfully, demand for our products and our sales volumes and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders. Our ability to service our debt may be limited, which could force us to reduce or delay advertising and promotional expenditures, restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate amount of $298.6 million of secured debt outstanding under our Credit Facility with $115 million of unused commitments under the Revolving Facility (as defined below). Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, acquisitions, expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to restrictive financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and our subsidiaries' long-term indebtedness;\n\u2022\nexposing us to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in pricing of or demand for our products; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in our industry and in our customers' industries.\nIn addition, borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, the variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nOur ability to pay interest, principal and fees on our Credit Facility will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to pay interest, principal and fees on our Credit Facility may depend on our customers' financial stability and their ability to pay us for their purchases in a timely fashion, or at all. Any significant default or delay in our customers' payments could result in our inability to pay interest, principal and fees on our Credit Facility in a timely fashion.\nOur debt levels and leverage ratio may be perceived as high for a growth company. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, fund our advertising and promotional expenditures and satisfy our capital expenditure requirements, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include reducing or delaying advertising and promotional expenditures, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance which, in turn, is subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are obligated for any reason to repay our Credit Facility before the scheduled installment dates, we could deplete our working capital, if available, or make raising additional funds necessary. Our failure to repay the secured debt financing, if required, could result in legal action against us which could materially harm our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding an aggregate amount of $298.6 million of secured debt under our Credit Facility. Any event of default could require the early repayment of our Credit Facility in whole or in part together with accrued interest on the outstanding principal balance of our Credit Facility and any other applicable penalties, including a default interest rate. If, prior to the maturity date, we are required to repay our Credit Facility in full, we would be required to use our limited working capital and raise additional funds. If we were unable to repay our Credit Facility, and other applicable penalties, when required, our lenders could commence legal action against us to recover the amounts due, which could include, among other things, a termination of their commitments to loan money, a requirement that certain obligations be cash collateralized, and foreclosure against the assets securing their borrowings. Any such action would be materially harmful to us and could require us to curtail or cease operations, and the Company could in such case be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur Credit Facility contains covenants that significantly restrict our operations, which may negatively affect our ability to operate our business and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities.\nOur Credit Facility contains numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business. Any other future debt agreements may contain similar covenants. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business, limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and adversely affect the conduct of our current business. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur more debt or issue certain equity interests;\n\u2022pay dividends, redeem or purchase our equity interests or make other distributions;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022make investments in foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022use assets as security in other transactions or otherwise create liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022enter into certain burdensome contracts;\n\u2022change the nature of our business in a material manner;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with others; and\n\u2022transfer or sell assets, including the equity interests of our subsidiaries, or use asset sale proceeds.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants described above could result in an event of default under our Credit Facility.
