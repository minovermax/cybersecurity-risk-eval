{"cik": "934612", "company": "BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE, LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe information set forth in Item 1A should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information in this report, including Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations\", and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nChanges in government policy could negatively impact demand for the Company\u2019s services, impair its ability to price its services, or increase its costs or liability exposure.\nChanges in United States and foreign government policies could change the economic environment and affect demand for the Company\u2019s services. For example, changes in clean air laws, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, permitting, or other regulatory requirements could reduce the demand for coal and other fossil fuels, or other products and revenues from the transportation services provided by BNSF Railway. Also, changes in environmental laws and other laws and regulations could reduce the demand for drilling products and products produced by drilling. United States and foreign government tariffs or subsidies could affect the demand for products the Company hauls. Developments and changes in laws and regulations as well as increased economic regulation of the rail industry through legislative action and revised rules and standards applied by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) in various areas, including rates, services, and access to facilities could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to determine prices for rail services and significantly affect the revenues, costs, and profitability of the Company\u2019s business. Additionally, because of the significant costs to maintain its rail network, a reduction in profitability could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to maintain, improve, or expand its rail network, facilities and equipment. Federal or state spending on infrastructure improvements or incentives that favor other modes of transportation could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws and amendments to existing tax regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to continue to comply with the significant federal, state, and local governmental regulations to which it is subject.\nThe Company is subject to a significant amount of governmental laws and regulations with respect to its rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations, and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which the Company operates without providing the Company with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on its business. For example, federal legislation, enacted in 2008 and amended in 2015, mandated the implementation of positive train control technology (PTC) by December 31, 2020, on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) hazardous materials are transported. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures.\nAs part of its railroad operations, the Company frequently transports chemicals and other hazardous materials, which could expose it to the risk of significant claims, losses, and penalties and operating restrictions.\nBNSF Railway frequently transports chemicals and other hazardous materials and is required to transport these commodities to the extent of its common carrier obligation. A release of TIH or other hazardous commodities could result in significant personal injury or loss of life and extensive property damage as well as environmental remediation and restoration obligations and penalties. The associated costs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity, as the Company is not insured above a certain threshold. Further, the rates BNSF Railway receives for transporting these commodities do not adequately compensate it should there be some type of accident. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to the Company in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities. Regulatory imposition of routing or speed or other restrictions on the transportation of such products could adversely affect train velocity and network fluidity and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nThe Company faces intense competition from rail carriers and other transportation providers, and its failure to compete effectively could adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive business environment. Depending on the specific market, the Company faces intermodal, intramodal, product, and geographic competition. Competition from other railroads and motor carriers, as well as barges, ships, and pipelines in certain markets, may be reflected in pricing, market share, level of services, reliability, and other factors. For example, the Company believes that high service truck lines, due to their ability to deliver non-bulk products on an expedited basis, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to compete for deliveries of non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. While the Company must build or acquire, maintain, and privately fund its rail system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained and funded by public entities. Any material increase in the capacity and quality or decrease in the cost of these alternative methods or the passage of legislation granting greater latitude to motor carriers with respect to size and weight restrictions or driver requirements could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, a failure to provide the level of service required by the Company\u2019s customers could result in loss of business to competitors. Changes in the ports used by ocean carriers or the use of all-water routes from the Pacific Rim to the East Coast or other changes in the supply chain or trade policy could also have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s volumes and revenues. Further, low natural gas or oil prices could impact future energy-related commodities demand.\nThe Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits, and increases in the amount or severity of these claims and lawsuits could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nAs part of its railroad operations, the Company is exposed to various claims and litigation related to commercial disputes, personal injury, property damage, environmental liability, and other matters. Personal injury claims by BNSF Railway employees are subject to the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA) rather than state workers\u2019 compensation laws. The Company believes that the FELA system, which includes unscheduled awards and a reliance on the jury system, can contribute to increased expenses. Other proceedings include claims by third parties for punitive as well as compensatory damages and, from time to time, may include proceedings that have been certified as or purport to be class actions. Developments in legislative and judicial standards, material changes to litigation trends, or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nThe Company is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may impose significant costs on its business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to the ground or waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. Many land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may continue to arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners, other third parties in toxic tort litigation, or as a result of alleged damages to natural resources or environmental incidents. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries have been and may continue to be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that they have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. The Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected as a result of any of the foregoing, and it may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination. The Company may also incur fines, penalties and other sanctions to resolve any alleged violations of environmental law. In addition, delays, litigation, local concerns, special interest opposition, and difficulty in obtaining approvals for projects requiring federal, state, or local equivalent permitting could inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to build strategic facilities and rail infrastructure, which could adversely impact growth and operational efficiency.\nDownturns in the economy could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nSignificant, extended negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions that impact the producers and consumers of the commodities transported by the Company may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity. Declines in or muted manufacturing activity, economic growth, and international trade all could result in reduced revenues in one or more business units.\nNegative changes in general economic conditions could lead to disruptions in the credit markets, increase credit risks and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or liquidity.\nChallenging economic conditions may not only affect revenues due to reduced demand for many goods and commodities, but could result in payment delays, increased credit risk and possible bankruptcies of customers. The Company\u2019s business is capital-intensive and the Company may finance a portion of the building and maintenance of infrastructure as well as the acquisition of locomotives and other rail equipment. Economic slowdowns and related credit market disruptions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost structure, its timely access to capital to meet financing needs, and costs of its financings. The Company could also face increased counterparty risk to its cash investments. Adverse economic conditions could also affect the Company\u2019s costs for insurance or its ability to acquire and maintain adequate insurance coverage for risks associated with the railroad business if insurance companies experience credit downgrades or bankruptcies. Declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect the Company\u2019s pension fund and railroad retirement tax rates, which in turn could increase funding requirements.\nFuel supply availability, fuel prices and dependency on certain key railroad equipment and material suppliers may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nFuel supply availability could be impacted as a result of limitations in refining capacity, disruptions to the supply chain, rising global demand and international political and economic factors. A significant reduction in fuel availability could impact the Company\u2019s ability to provide transportation services at current levels, increase fuel costs, and impact the economy. Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity. If the price of fuel increases substantially, the Company expects to be able to recover a significant portion of these higher fuel costs. However, to the extent that the Company is unable to recover these costs, increases in fuel prices could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity. Due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of certain railroad equipment and material, prospective new suppliers are subject to high barriers of entry. If railroad equipment and material suppliers experience a supply or capacity shortage or discontinue operations, or if they are unable to meet regulatory specifications, the Company could experience significant cost increases as well as limited supply of railroad equipment and material necessary for the Company\u2019s operations.\nClimate change, market or regulatory responses to climate change, and other emissions-related laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nClimate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed, and in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial, and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions. Changes in clean air laws, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and permitting or other regulatory requirements could reduce the demand for coal or other commodities we carry and, thereby, affect revenues from the transportation services provided by BNSF Railway. Emission regulations, including additional federal, state, or local carbon pricing, could also affect fuel efficiency and increase operating costs. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes in consumer preferences for goods and services relating to alternative sources of energy or emission reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Finally, changes to or limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other criteria air pollutants could also result in significant capital expenditures to comply with these regulations.\nSevere weather and natural disasters could disrupt normal business operations, the potential effects of which could result in increased costs and liabilities and decreases in revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent on its ability to operate its railroad system efficiently. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornados, fires, flooding, and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, damages to or loss of use of significant aspects of the Company\u2019s infrastructure due to natural or man-made disruptions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity for an extended period of time until repairs or replacements could be made. Additionally, during natural disasters, the Company\u2019s workforce may be unavailable, which could result in further delays. Extreme swings in weather could also negatively affect the performance of locomotives and rolling stock.\nThe Company\u2019s operational dependencies may adversely affect results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nDue to the integrated nature of the United States\u2019 freight transportation infrastructure, the Company\u2019s operations may be negatively affected by service disruptions of other entities, such as ports, passenger trains, and other railroads, which interchange with the Company. A significant, prolonged service disruption of one or more of these entities could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nSignificant unexpected increases in demand for the Company\u2019s services may adversely affect service levels and operational efficiency.\nIf increases in demand for the Company\u2019s services significantly exceed expectations, including in a particular geographical region, the Company may experience network difficulties including congestion or reduced velocity, negatively impacting the level of service provided. Although investments to add capacity continue to be made to meet future anticipated demand, delays in or inability to complete permitting may delay or preclude implementation of these capacity improvements. This may impact operational efficiency and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nActs of terrorism or war, as well as the threat of terrorism or war, may cause significant disruptions in the Company\u2019s business operations.\nTerrorist attacks and any government response to those types of attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. The Company\u2019s rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror, which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have an adverse effect on operating results and financial condition. Such effects could be magnified if releases of hazardous materials are involved. Any act of terror, retaliatory strike, sustained military campaign, or war or risk of war may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition by causing unpredictable operating or financial conditions, including disruptions of BNSF Railway or connecting rail lines, loss of critical customers or partners, volatility of or a sustained increase of fuel prices, fuel shortages, general economic decline, and instability or weakness of financial markets. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, the coverage available may not adequately compensate it for certain types of incidents and certain coverages may not be available to the Company in the future.\nThe Company depends on the stability and availability of its technology systems.\nThe Company relies on technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of its technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, the inability to protect corporate information or assets against unauthorized use, or other operational difficulties. Although the Company has taken steps to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning, systems testing, protection and monitoring, and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Additionally, if the Company is unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt, or protect rights around new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nMost of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by unions, and failure to negotiate reasonable collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher ongoing labor costs.\nA significant majority of BNSF Railway\u2019s employees are union-represented. BNSF Railway\u2019s union employees work under collective bargaining agreements with various labor organizations. Wages, health and welfare benefits, work rules, and other issues have traditionally been addressed through industry-wide negotiations. These negotiations have generally taken place over an extended period of time and have previously not resulted in any extended work stoppages. For ongoing negotiations, the existing agreements have remained in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act\u2019s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of presidential or congressional intervention) are exhausted. While the negotiations have not yet resulted in any extended work stoppages, if BNSF Railway is unable to negotiate acceptable new agreements, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, loss of business, disruption of operations, and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nThe unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nChanges in demographics, training requirements, and the unavailability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet demand for rail service. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly those with expertise in the railroad industry, are vital to operations. Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a negative impact on operational efficiency and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 50227, "SIC": 4011, "TIC": "BRK3"}
