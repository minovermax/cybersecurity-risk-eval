Investors should carefully consider the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report before deciding to purchase our common stock. The items listed below present risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business. Some of these risks are interrelated and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others.\nCREDIT RISK\nWe are subject to credit risk from our lending activities.\nThere are inherent risks associated with our lending activities. When we lend money or commit to lend money, we incur credit risk or the risk of loss if borrowers do not repay their loans or other credit obligations. Credit risk includes, among other things, the quality of our underwriting, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as across the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. If loan customers with significant loan balances fail to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and capital levels will suffer.\nWe are exposed to higher credit and concentration risk from our commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and commercial construction lending.\nOur credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 76% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans, including commercial and industrial, equipment financing, commercial construction and commercial real estate mortgage loans. Our borrowers under these loans tend to be small to medium-sized businesses. These types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. During periods of lower economic growth or challenging economic periods, small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of such businesses to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and commodity and real estate values and an increase in unemployment in certain states or locations could result in materially higher credit losses if loans are concentrated in those locations. Our loans are heavily concentrated in our primary markets of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee. These markets may have different or weaker performance than other areas of the country and our portfolio may be more negatively impacted than a financial services company with wider geographic diversity.\nSee the section captioned \u201cLoans\u201d in the \u201cBalance Sheet Review\u201d section of \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d located elsewhere in this Report for further discussion related to commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans.\nIf our allowance for loan losses (including the fair value adjustments with respect to loans acquired in acquisitions) is not enough to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management\u2019s best estimate of inherent losses that have been incurred in our existing loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of factors including the volume and types of loans; industry concentrations; specific credit risks; internal loan classifications; trends in classifications; volume and trends in delinquencies, non-accruals and charge-offs; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; industry and peer bank loan quality indications; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves subjectivity in our modeling and requires us to make estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes or vary from our historical experience. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nThe application of the purchase method of accounting in our acquisitions (and any future acquisitions) also will affect our allowance for loan losses. Under the purchase method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their\nestimated fair value at the time of acquisition and any related allowance for loan loss was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair value are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows after they were acquired resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows, which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Furthermore, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe implemented CECL on January 1, 2020, which will result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses of $8.75 million, of which $3.59 million will be reclassified from the fair value mark for purchased credit deteriorated loans, and a decrease in capital of $3.53 million, net of tax. In future periods, CECL may result in increased reserves during or in advance of an economic downturn. Because CECL recognizes the expected losses over the life of the loan at the time the loan is made, it is possible that CECL implementation may increase the cost of lending in the industry and result in slower loan growth and lower levels of net income. The adoption of the CECL model may materially affect how we determine our allowance for credit losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Report \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and financial stability of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact daily, and therefore could adversely affect us. We have exposure to various counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial and correspondent banks, and others. As a result, defaults by, or rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, may result in market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by such other institutions. Such occurrences could expose us to credit risk in the event of default of one or more counterparties and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity represents an institution\u2019s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to satisfy current or future funding requirements and needs.\nThe objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that our cash flow requirements resulting from depositor, borrower and other creditor demands as well as our operating cash needs, are met, and that our cost of funding such requirements and needs is reasonable. We maintain an asset/liability and interest rate risk policy and a liquidity and funds management policy, including a contingency funding plan that, among other things, include procedures for managing and monitoring liquidity risk. Generally, we rely on deposits, repayments of loans and leases and cash flows from our investment securities as our primary sources of funds. Our principal deposit sources include consumer, commercial and public funds customers in our markets. We have used these funds, together with wholesale deposit sources such as brokered deposits, along with Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances, federal funds purchased and other sources of short-term and long-term borrowings, to make loans and leases, acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations.\nAn inability to maintain or raise funds in amounts necessary to meet our liquidity needs could have a substantial negative effect, individually or collectively, on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. For example, factors that could\ndetrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business. Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position, increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeposit levels may be affected by several factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments, general economic and market conditions and other factors. Loan and lease repayments are a relatively stable source of funds but are subject to the borrowers\u2019 and lessees\u2019 ability to repay loans and leases, which can be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in general economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups or specific businesses, declines in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and other factors. Furthermore, loans and leases generally are not readily convertible to cash. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet growth in loans and leases, deposit withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such secondary sources include FHLB advances, brokered deposits, secured and unsecured federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, Federal Reserve borrowings and/or accessing the equity or debt capital markets.\nThe availability of these secondary funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions, to regulation and to investor assessment of our financial strength and, as such, the cost of funds may fluctuate significantly and/or the availability of such funds may be restricted, thus impacting our net interest income, our immediate liquidity and/or our access to additional liquidity. If we fail to remain \u201cwell capitalized\u201d our ability to utilize brokered deposits may be restricted. We have somewhat similar risks to the extent high balance core deposits exceed the amount of deposit insurance coverage available.\nWe anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on deposits, loan and lease repayments, and cash flows from our investment securities to provide liquidity. Additionally, when necessary, the secondary sources of borrowed funds described above will be used to augment our primary funding sources. If we are unable to access any of these secondary funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet our customers\u2019 or creditors\u2019 needs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and our ability to raise capital and maintain required capital levels could be affected by changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions.\nFederal and state bank regulators require United and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support operations. At December 31, 2019, both the Holding Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios were above \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d levels under regulatory guidelines. However, our business strategy calls for continued growth in our existing banking markets and targeted expansion in new markets. Growth in assets at rates in excess of the rate at which our capital is increased through retained earnings will reduce our capital ratios unless we continue to increase capital via other means. Failure by us to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities and would negatively impact our ability to pursue acquisitions or other expansion opportunities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital (including through the issuance of common stock) in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and business needs or in connection with acquisitions. Our ability to maintain capital levels could be impacted by negative perceptions of our business or prospects, changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that access to capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and/or debt and, in turn, our liquidity. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to expand through internal growth or acquisitions or to continue operations could be impaired, and we may need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets to meet maturing liabilities. We may be unable to do so or have to do so on terms which are unfavorable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Holding Company\u2019s ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect its liquidity and ability to declare and pay dividends.\nWhile our board of directors has approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock since the fourth quarter of 2013, there can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors including, among others, asset\nquality, earnings performance, liquidity and capital requirements. Our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock is dividends that we receive from the Bank. As a Georgia state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay, as described under \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Payment of Dividends\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. The federal banking agencies have also issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current earnings. The Federal Reserve may also prevent the payment of a dividend by the Bank if it determines that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Holding Company and the Bank must also maintain the CET1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends. If the Bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to the Holding Company, it is unlikely that we would be able to continue to pay dividends on our common stock or to pay interest on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, the terms of our debentures prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock until we have made required payments under the debentures or if we have deferred payments under the terms of such debentures. See \u201cMARKET RISKS - Holders of our indebtedness have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.\u201d\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions, cyber-attacks or breaches of security could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks as well as through the internet through digital and mobile technologies. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant, the advances in technology increase the risk of information security breaches. We provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet or through their mobile device. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect our customer relationships.\nThere have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber-attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services, credit bureaus and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, by both private individuals and foreign governments. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Our network, and the systems of parties with whom we contract, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. These risks are heightened through the increasing use of digital and mobile solutions which allow for rapid money movement and increase the difficulty to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches (including breaches of security of customer systems and networks) and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nWe rely on information technology and telecommunications systems and certain third-party service providers and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party accounting systems and mobile and online banking platforms. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems and online banking platforms. While we have selected these vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Financial or operational difficulties of a vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Because our information technology and\ntelecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with technological changes could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability.\nThe banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in each of our markets from many other financial institutions. We compete with banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as community, super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes. In addition, as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions that can operate profitably with a narrower net interest margin and have a more diverse revenue base. In addition, many have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size, more limited geographic diversification and inability to spread costs across broader markets. Although we compete by concentrating marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements, personal contacts and greater flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers, customer loyalty can be easily influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products and our strategy may or may not continue to be successful. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be affected by the marketplace loosening of credit underwriting standards and structures.\nAn ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks and/or losses and could have adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe have implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, capital, compliance, strategic and reputational risks. Our framework also includes financial, analytical, forecasting, or other modeling methodologies, which involves management assumptions and judgment. In addition, our board of directors, in consultation with management, has adopted a risk appetite statement, which sets forth certain thresholds and limits to govern our overall risk profile. However, there is no assurance that our risk management framework, including the risk metrics under our risk appetite statement, will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately identify, manage or mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and become subject to regulatory consequences, as a result of which our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of our loan customers, third-party service providers and employees.\nWhen we make loans to individuals or entities, we rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant\u2019s loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower\u2019s net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While we attempt to verify information provided through available sources, we cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. Our reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. These losses may be material and negatively affect our results of operations, financial\ncondition or prospects. These losses could also lead to significant reputational risks and other effects. The sophistication of external fraud actors continues to increase, and in some cases includes large criminal rings, which increases the resources and infrastructure needed to thwart these attacks. The industry fraud threat continues to evolve, including but not limited to card fraud, check fraud, social engineering and phishing attacks for identity theft and account takeover.\nOur inability to retain management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services or technology professionals could impair our relationship with our customers, reduce growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe have assembled a management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services in our markets. Moreover, much of our organic loan growth in recent years was the result of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions. We anticipate deploying a similar hiring strategy in the future. Operating our technology systems requires employees with specialized skills that are not readily available in the general employee candidate pool. Inability to retain these key personnel (including key personnel of the businesses we have acquired) or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals\u2019 skills and customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them. Moreover, the higher costs we must pay to hire and retain these experienced individuals could cause our noninterest expense levels to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.\nREGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISK\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could restrict our activities. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations or failures to comply with such laws and regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation and legislation subject United and other financial institutions to restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our common stock. We are heavily regulated by federal and state authorities. This regulation is designed primarily to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, but not shareholders. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory authorities continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including interpretation and implementation of statutes, regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Any regulatory changes or scrutiny could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand our permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations and other institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFederal and state regulators can impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements on our bank and nonbank subsidiaries if they determine, upon examination or otherwise, violations of laws, rules or regulations with which we or our subsidiaries must comply, or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include directors\u2019 resolutions, memoranda of understanding, cease and desist or consent orders, civil money penalties and termination of deposit insurance and bank closures. Enforcement actions may be taken regardless of the capital level of the institution. In particular, institutions that are not sufficiently capitalized in accordance with regulatory standards may also face capital directives or prompt corrective action. Enforcement actions may require certain corrective steps (including staff additions or changes), impose limits on activities (such as lending, deposit taking, acquisitions or branching), prescribe lending parameters (such as loan types, volumes and terms) and require additional capital to be raised, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Enforcement actions, including the imposition of monetary penalties, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, damage our reputation, and result in the loss of our holding company status. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from our operations, cause us to incur significant expenses, restrict us from engaging in potentially profitable activities and limit our ability to raise capital. Closure of the Bank would result in a total loss of your investment.\nIn addition to other banking regulations, the federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal FinCEN, established by the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business\nplan, including any acquisition plans that we have, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nChanges in other laws and regulations not specific to banking or financial services could also negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations that affect our customers and business partners could negatively affect our revenues and expenses. Certain changes in laws such as recent tax law reforms that impose limitations on the deductibility of interest may decrease the demand for our products or services and could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. Changes in bankruptcy law, zoning or land use laws and regulations or environmental laws, rules, regulation and enforcement or other statutes, ordinances, rules or administrative or judicial interpretations that affect our customers\u2019 businesses could negatively impact our business.\nChanges to capital requirements for bank holding companies and depository institutions that are now fully effective may restrict our ability to pay or increase dividends on or repurchase our common stock and may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain. From time to time, the regulators change these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. In particular, the capital requirements applicable to us under the Basel III rules became fully effective on January 1, 2019. We are now required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards than we had in the past, including the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends, share repurchases or redemptions. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.\nBecause our total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion, we are subject to regulations and oversight that could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses.\nBecause we exceeded $10 billion in total consolidated assets in 2017, we have become subject to regulations and oversight that could adversely affect our revenues and expenses. Such regulations and oversight include the following:\n\u2022\nOversight by the CFPB. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business.\n\u2022\nFDIC Deposit Assessment Scorecard. With respect to deposit-taking activities, we now are subject to a deposit assessment based on a scorecard issued by the FDIC that considers, among other things, the Bank\u2019s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as our use of core deposits. Depending on the results of a bank\u2019s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 2.5 to 45 basis points. Any increase in the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nDurbin Amendment. We no longer are exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards known as the Durbin Amendment. The Bank now is limited to receiving only a \u201creasonable\u201d interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by the Bank to our customers. The Federal Reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than $10 billion in total assets to receive more than $0.21 plus five basis points of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. Future limitations upon interchange fees that may be charged could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of becoming subject to the heightened regulatory requirements, we have hired and continue to hire additional compliance personnel and implement structural initiatives to address these requirements. However, compliance with these and future requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, we may issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. We may sell these shares at prices below the current market price of shares, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute shareholder ownership. We could also issue\nadditional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions or other investments, which could also dilute shareholder ownership.\nMARKET RISKS\nChanges in the method pursuant to which LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Our floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, the prime rate or the federal funds rate. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nAlthough we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, the market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference ratio is complex and the failure to adequately manage the transition could have a range of material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the potential to:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nprompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022\nresult in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and\n\u2022\nrequire the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management and business, is uncertain.\nAdverse conditions in the business or economic environment where we operate, as well as broader conditions, globally and in the United States, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends significantly upon local, national and global economic and political conditions, as well as governmental monetary policies and trade relations. Our financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. Unlike banks that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional bank that provides services to customers primarily in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee. The market conditions in these markets may be different from, and could be worse than, the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. Adverse changes in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which we operate could affect impact our business, including causing one or more of the following negative developments:\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of the collateral securing our residential or commercial real estate loans;\n\u2022\na permanent impairment of our assets; or\n\u2022\nan increase in the number of customers or other counterparties who default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses.\nOur success is also influenced heavily by population growth, income levels, loans and deposits and on stability in real estate values in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally weaken significantly, our business may be adversely affected. If market and economic conditions deteriorate, this may lead to valuation adjustments on our loan portfolio and losses on defaulted loans and on the sale of other real estate owned. Additionally, such adverse economic conditions in our market areas, specifically decreases in real estate property values due to the nature of our loan portfolio, the majority of which is secured by real estate, could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are less able than larger institutions to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a larger number of more diverse economies.\nOur net interest margin, and consequently our net earnings, are significantly affected by interest rate levels.\nOur profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on loans, leases and investment securities and interest expense paid on deposits, other borrowings, senior debt and subordinated notes. The absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates, including changes to the shape of the yield curve, may affect our level of interest income, the primary component of our gross revenue, as well as the level of our interest expense. In a period of changing interest rates, interest expense may increase at different rates than the interest earned on assets, impacting our net interest income. Interest rate fluctuations are caused by many factors which, for the most part, are not under our control. For example, national monetary policy implemented by the Federal Reserve plays a significant role in the determination of interest rates. Additionally, competitor pricing and the resulting negotiations that occur with our customers also impact the rates we collect on loans and the rates we pay on deposits. In addition, the discontinuance of LIBOR as a reference rate, and the uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the value of reference rate-linked debt securities and derivatives that we hold or issue, which could further impact our interest rate spread.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect demand for, and thus our ability to originate, loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our results of operations and financial condition. A decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. As a result, we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions, upon terms that are not favorable to us, in order to maintain our liquidity. If those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments, we will incur losses.\nBecause of significant competitive pressures in our markets and the negative impact of these pressures on our deposit and loan pricing, coupled with the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio has variable rate pricing that moves in concert with changes to the Federal Reserve\u2019s federal funds rate or LIBOR (both of which are at relatively low levels as a result of macroeconomic conditions), our net interest margin may be negatively impacted if these short-term rates remain at their low levels or decrease further. However, if short-term interest rates rise, our results of operations may also be negatively impacted if we are unable to increase the rates we charge on loans or earn on our investment securities in excess of the increases we must pay on deposits and our other funding sources. As interest rates change, we expect that we will periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings) will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities), or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d may work against us, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nWe have historically entered into certain hedging transactions including interest rate swaps, which are designed to lessen elements of our interest rate exposure. If interest rates do not change in the manner anticipated, such transactions may not be effective and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, and the impacts of pandemics may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt\u037e which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. On January 26, 2020, President Trump signed a new trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The full impact of this agreement on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in our primary banking markets is currently unknown. In addition, the effects (or perceived effects) of\npandemics (including matters such as the coronavirus) may affect international trade, supply chains, travel, employee productivity and other economic activities. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies, as well as the effects (or perceived effects) of pandemics and other public concerns, have the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, some of which are unrelated to our financial performance, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; or\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts, the effects (or perceived effects) of pandemics and trade relations.\nGeneral market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the local economy; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; interest rate changes, oil price volatility or credit loss trends could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results.\nAlthough our common stock currently is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market\u2019s Global Select Market, or \u201cNasdaq\u201d, it has less liquidity than other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on Nasdaq, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on Nasdaq has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq or other stock exchanges. For 2019, our average daily trading volume was 412,773 shares. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nHolders of our indebtedness have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding senior debentures, subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities and accompanying subordinated debentures totaling $213 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the senior debentures, subordinated debentures and the subordinated debentures accompanying the trust preferred securities are senior to payments with respect to shares of our common stock. We also conditionally guarantee payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities. As a result, we must make payments on these debt instruments (including the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debt must be satisfied before any distributions can be\nmade on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities (and the related guarantee of payments on the trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock. If our financial condition deteriorates or if we do not receive required regulatory approvals, we may be required to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities (and the related guarantee of payments on the trust preferred securities).\nWe may from time to time issue additional senior or subordinated indebtedness that would have to be repaid before our shareholders would be entitled to receive any of our assets.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein and our shareholders will bear the risk of loss if the value or market price of our common stock is adversely affected.\nUnited\u2019s corporate organizational documents and the provisions of Georgia law to which we are subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of United that you may favor.\nUnited\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended (our \u201carticles\u201d), and bylaws, as amended (our \u201cbylaws\u201d), contain various provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of United. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na provision allowing the board of directors to consider the interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and creditors when considering an acquisition proposal;\n\u2022\na provision that all amendments to the articles and bylaws must be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022\na provision requiring that any business combination involving United be approved by 75% of the outstanding shares of United\u2019s common stock excluding shares held by stockholders who are deemed to have an interest in the transaction unless the business combination is approved by 75% of United\u2019s directors;\n\u2022\na provision restricting removal of directors except for cause and upon the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022\na provision that any special meeting of shareholders may be called only by the chairman, chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, board of directors or the holders of 25% of the outstanding shares of United\u2019s capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022\na provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for matters to be considered at an annual meeting of shareholders.\nAdditionally, United\u2019s articles authorize the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The issuance of our preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a controlling interest in us. In addition, certain provisions of Georgia law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Georgia corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of United.\nLEGAL RISKS\nWe are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.\nWe are from time to time subject to certain litigation in the ordinary course of our business. As we hire new revenue producing employees, we, and the employees we hire, may also periodically be the subject of litigation and threatened litigation with these employees\u2019 former employers. We may also be subject to claims related to our loan servicing programs, particularly those involving servicing of commercial real estate loans. From time to time, and particularly during periods of economic stress, customers, including real estate developers and consumer borrowers, may make claims or otherwise take legal action pertaining to performance of our responsibilities. These claims are often referred to as \u201clender liability\u201d claims and are sometimes brought in an effort to produce or increase leverage against us in workout negotiations or debt collection proceedings. Lender liability claims frequently assert one or more of the following allegations: breach of fiduciary duties, fraud, economic duress, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and similar claims.\nThese and other claims and legal actions, as well as supervisory and enforcement actions by our regulators, including the CFPB or other regulatory agencies with which we deal, including those with oversight of our loan servicing programs, could involve large monetary claims, capital directives, agreements with federal regulators, cease and desist orders and significant defense costs. The outcome of any such cases or actions is uncertain. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, properties securing loans we have originated or purchased which are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur acquisitions and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nWe expect to continue to expand in our current markets and in select attractive growth markets through additional branches and also may consider expansion within these markets through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including:\nPlanning and Execution of Expansion. We may be unable to successfully:\n\u2022\nidentify and expand into suitable markets;\n\u2022\nidentify and acquire suitable sites for new banking offices and comply with zoning and permitting requirements;\n\u2022\nidentify and evaluate potential acquisition and merger targets in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\ndevelop accurate estimates and judgments to evaluate asset values and credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to an acquired branch or institution, a new branch office or a new market;\n\u2022\nmanage transaction costs to preserve the expected financial benefits of the transaction;\n\u2022\navoid the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to operations by the negotiation of a transaction;\n\u2022\nmanage entry into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory and other approvals, or obtain such approvals without restrictive conditions;\n\u2022\navoid the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse effects on results of operations; or\n\u2022\nfinance an acquisition or expansion or avoid possible dilution of our tangible book value and/or net income per common share.\nManagement of Growth. We may be unable to successfully:\n\u2022\nmaintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\u2022\nattract sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;\n\u2022\navoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of the acquired institution;\n\u2022\nhire or retain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee and support such growth;\n\u2022\navoid the loss of key employees and customers of an acquired branch or institution;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions;\n\u2022\nimplement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth;\n\u2022\nintegrate the acquired financial institution or portion of the institution; or\n\u2022\navoid temporary disruption of our business or the business of the acquired institution.\nRegulatory and Economic Factors. Our growth and expansion plans also may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering into or expanding in our targeted markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFuture acquisitions may dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership of United and may cause United to become more susceptible to adverse economic events.\nFuture business acquisitions could be material to United and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require us to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, we could become more susceptible to economic downturns, dislocations in capital markets and competitive pressures.\nGENERAL BUSINESS RISKS\nOur reported financial results incorporate significant assumptions, estimates and judgments. In addition, changes in accounting standards or interpretations could impact our reported earnings and financial condition.\nManagement must make significant assumptions and estimates and exercise significant judgment in selecting and applying accounting and reporting policies. In some cases, management must select a policy from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, which may result in reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective and complex assumptions, estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions and estimates. These critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses, fair value measurement and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of assumptions and estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for loan losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; significantly decrease the carrying value of loans, foreclosed property or other assets or liabilities to reflect a reduction in their fair value; or, significantly increase or decrease accrued taxes and the value of our deferred tax assets.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory agencies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued a new current expected credit loss rule, which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to then-existing practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred. For additional information, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the recasting of our prior period financial statements.\nWeather-related events or other natural disasters may have an effect on the performance of our loan portfolios, especially in our coastal markets, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.\nOur operations and customer base are located in markets where natural disasters, including tornadoes, severe storms, fires, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes have occurred. Such natural disasters could significantly affect the local population and economies and our business, and could pose physical risks to our properties. Although our banking offices are geographically dispersed throughout portions of the southeastern United States and we maintain insurance coverage for such events, a significant natural disaster in or near one or more of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nNegative publicity could damage our reputation and our business.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our earnings, liquidity and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, securities compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and disclosure, from sharing or inadequate protection of customer information and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. Negative public opinion could also result from adverse news or publicity that impairs the reputation of the financial services industry\ngenerally. Because we conduct most of our business under the \u201cUnited\u201d brand, negative public opinion about one business could affect our other businesses.\nDisruptions in the operation of government or changes in government funding may adversely affect us.\nCertain of our operations and customers are dependent on the regular operation of the federal or state government or programs they administer. For example, our SBA lending program depends on interaction with the SBA, an independent agency of the federal government. During a lapse in funding, such as has occurred during previous federal government \u201cshutdowns\u201d, the SBA may not be able to engage in such interaction. Similarly, loans we make through USDA lending programs may be delayed or adversely affected by lapses in funding for the USDA. In addition, customers who depend directly or indirectly on providing goods and services to federal or state governments or their agencies may reduce their business with us or delay repayment of loans due to lost or delayed revenue from those relationships. If funding for these lending programs or federal spending generally is reduced as part of the appropriations process or by administrative decision, demand for our services may be reduced. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential holders of our securities could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nMaintaining and adapting our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is expensive and requires significant management attention. Moreover, as we continue to grow, our internal controls may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amid dynamic regulatory and other guidance. Failure to implement effective controls or difficulties encountered in the process may harm our results of operations and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our securities from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as the trading price of our securities, and could potentially subject us to litigation.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision.\nWe compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89323, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "UCBI"}
