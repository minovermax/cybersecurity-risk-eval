{"cik": "874015", "company": "IONIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics. To date, we believe the impacts of the recent COVID-19 pandemic on our business are limited and manageable.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we or our partners are commercializing our medicines, have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers and contract research organizations upon whom we rely. For example, since December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, has spread worldwide. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, or the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the U.S. government-imposed restrictions on travel between the U.S., Europe and certain other countries. In addition, the Governor of the State of California and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the states in which our and Akcea\u2019s offices are located, respectively, each declared a state of emergency related to the spread of COVID-19 and issued executive orders that directed residents to stay at home.\nIn response to these public health directives and orders, we implemented work-from-home policies for most of our employees globally and generally suspended business-related travel. Out of an abundance of caution and to protect the health and welfare of our employees, we continue to maintain work-from-home policies for most of our employees. We believe the effects of these work-from-home and travel policies have thus far had a limited impact on our business.\nThese public health directives and orders have also impacted our and our partners\u2019 sales efforts. For example, some physician and hospital policies that have been put in place as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic restrict in-person access by third parties, which has in some cases impacted our commercialization efforts for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. Additionally, Biogen has reported that as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, SPINRAZA sales revenues have decreased in part because SPINRAZA doses have been delayed due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and that future SPINRAZA sales revenues may be adversely affected by continued dosing delays. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our or our partner\u2019s commercial operations could materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition in the future.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place, executive and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain.\nWe have experienced impacts to our clinical trial operations due to the COVID-19 Pandemic; however, we believe such impacts are limited and manageable. Some examples of these impacts include:\n\u25cf we have experienced some impact on clinical site initiation and patient enrollment due to restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\no For example, in March 2020, we instituted a temporary suspension of enrollment for new subjects in our Phase 3 studies of IONIS-TTR-LRx based on advice from our trial advisory committee; however, enrollment has resumed.\n\u25cf some patients have not been able to meet protocol requirements, as quarantines have impeded patient movement and interrupted healthcare services;\n\u25cf we have experienced some delays in site initiations due to principle investigators and site staff focusing on and prioritizing COVID-19 patient care; and\n\u25cf we have experienced some delays in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government or contractor personnel.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 Pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and has and could continue to affect the value of our securities.\nThe global COVID-19 Pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. While we have not yet experienced material adverse effects to our business as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. As such, we do not yet know the full extent of delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 Pandemic closely.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of our Medicines\nWe have limited experience as a company in commercializing medicines, and we may have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities. If we are unable to establish effective marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market, sell and distribute our medicines, we may not be able to generate revenue from our medicines.\nWe have limited experience as a company in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure to effectively manage our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our medicines. We may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and distribution functions on acceptable financial terms, or at all. Even if we are able to engage third parties to market, sell and distribute our medicines, our product revenues and profitability may be lower if we rely on such third parties for these functions than if we were to perform them on our own. In addition, we likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to market, sell and distribute our medicines effectively. If we are not successful in commercializing our medicines, either on our own or through arrangements with one or more third parties, we may not be able to generate revenue from our medicines.\nIf the market does not accept our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, we are not likely to generate substantial revenues or become consistently profitable.\nEven if our medicines are authorized for marketing, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, our success will depend upon the medical community, patients and third-party payers accepting our medicines as medically useful, cost-effective, safe and convenient. Even when the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities authorize our or our partners\u2019 medicines for commercialization, doctors may not prescribe our medicines to treat patients. We and our partners may not successfully commercialize additional medicines.\nAdditionally, in many of the markets where we or our partners may sell our medicines in the future, if we or our partners cannot agree with the government or other third-party payers regarding the price we can charge for our medicines, then we may not be able to sell our medicines in that market. Similarly, cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payers could decrease the price received for our medicines or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, economically unviable.\nThe degree of market acceptance for our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, depends upon a number of factors, including the:\n\u25cf receipt and scope of marketing authorizations;\n\u25cf establishment and demonstration in the medical and patient community of the efficacy and safety of our medicines and their potential advantages over competing products;\n\u25cf cost and effectiveness of our medicines compared to other available therapies;\n\u25cf patient convenience of the dosing regimen for our medicines; and\n\u25cf reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.\nBased on the profile of our medicines, physicians, patients, patient advocates, payers or the medical community in general may not accept or use any medicines that we may develop.\nFor example, the product label for TEGSEDI in the U.S. has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis, requires periodic blood and urine monitoring, and TEGSEDI is only available through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program. Our main competition in the U.S. market for TEGSEDI is patisiran, marketed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Although patisiran requires intravenous administration and pre-treatment with steroids, it does not have a boxed warning or REMS. Additionally, the product label for WAYLIVRA in the EU requires regular blood monitoring. In each case, these label requirements could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients for these medicines. We believe that the enhanced monitoring we have implemented to support early detection and management of these issues can help manage these safety issues so that patients can continue treatment. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. While we believe we can better maintain patients on TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA through our patient-centric commercial approach where we plan to have greater involvement with physicians and patients, if we cannot effectively maintain patients on TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA, including due to limitations or restrictions on our ability to conduct periodic blood and urine monitoring of our patients as a result of the current COVID-19 Pandemic, we may not be able to generate substantial revenue from TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA sales.\nIf we or our partners fail to compete effectively, our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, will not contribute significant revenues.\nOur competitors engage in drug discovery throughout the world, are numerous, and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biopharmaceutical firms. Other companies are engaged in developing antisense technology. Our competitors may succeed in developing medicines that are:\n\u25cf priced lower than our medicines;\n\u25cf reimbursed more favorably by government and other third-party payers than our medicines;\n\u25cf safer than our medicines;\n\u25cf more effective than our medicines; or\n\u25cf more convenient to use than our medicines.\nThese competitive developments could make our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, obsolete or non-competitive.\nCertain of our partners are pursuing other technologies or developing other medicines either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, to treat the same diseases our own collaborative programs target. Competition may negatively impact a partner\u2019s focus on and commitment to our medicines and, as a result, could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical testing and human clinical studies of new pharmaceutical products, in obtaining FDA and other regulatory authorizations of such products and in commercializing such products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory authorization for products earlier than we do.\nThere are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization in certain geographic markets of products against targets that are also targets of products in our development pipeline. For example:\n\u25cf Onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam compete with SPINRAZA;\n\u25cf Patisiran, tafamidis and tafamidis meglumine compete with TEGSEDI;\n\u25cf Vutrisiran and AG10 could compete with TEGSEDI and IONIS-TTR-LRx;\n;\u25cf ARO-APOC3, lomitapide and gemcabene could compete with WAYLIVRA and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx;\n\u25cf WVE-120101/WVE-120102, selistat, VX15 and AMT-130 could compete with tominersen; and\n\u25cf Arimoclomol, ultomiris, mastinib and trehalose could compete with tofersen.\nSpecifically, SPINRAZA faces competition from onasemnogene abeparvovec, a new gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 and in the EU in May 2020 for the treatment of SMA as well as risdiplam, a new oral product for the treatment of SMA that was approved in the U.S. in August 2020. Biogen has disclosed that SPINRAZA revenue has decreased due in part to lower sales volumes as a result of increased competition and that future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by the commercialization of competing products. SPINRAZA injection for intrathecal use is an antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of SMA patients of all ages approved in over 50 countries.\nAdditionally, companies that are developing medicines that target the same patient populations as our medicines in development may compete with us to enroll participants in the clinical trials for such medicines, which could make it more difficult for us to complete enrollment for these clinical trials.\nCertain of our medicines may compete with our other medicines, which could reduce our expected revenues.\nCertain of our medicines inhibit the production of the same protein. For example, WAYLIVRA inhibits the production of the same protein as IONIS-APOCIII-LRx and TEGSEDI inhibits the production of the same protein as IONIS-TTR-LRx. We believe the enhancements we incorporated into IONIS-APOCIII-LRx and IONIS-TTR-LRx can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses and less frequent administration compared to WAYLIVRA and TEGSEDI, respectively. As such, to the extent physicians and patients elect to use IONIS-APOCIII-LRx or IONIS-TTR-LRx instead of WAYLIVRA or TEGSEDI, respectively, it will reduce the revenue we derive from those medicines. In addition, while vupanorsen, IONIS-APOCIII-LRx and WAYLIVRA use different mechanisms of action, if vupanorsen and IONIS-APOCIII- LRx can effectively lower triglyceride levels in patients, including patients with FCS, WAYLIVRA, vupanorsen and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx may compete with each other.\nOur medicines could be subject to regulatory limitations following approval.\nFollowing approval of a medicine, we and our partners must comply with comprehensive government regulations regarding the manufacture, marketing and distribution of medicines. Promotional communications regarding prescription medicines must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. We or our partners may not obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable to successfully commercialize our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to impose significant restrictions on an approved medicine through the product label and on advertising, promotional and distribution activities. For example:\n\u25cf in the U.S., TEGSEDI\u2019s label contains a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis;\n\u25cf TEGSEDI requires periodic blood and urine monitoring;\n\u25cf in the U.S., TEGSEDI is available only through a REMS program; and\n\u25cf we expect WAYLIVRA will require periodic blood monitoring if approved in the U.S.\nPrescription medicines may be promoted only for the approved indications in accordance with the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label may be subject to significant liability.\nIn addition, when approved, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may condition approval on the performance of post-approval clinical studies or patient monitoring, which could be time consuming and expensive. For example, in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, we are required to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory, the FDA, EC or other foreign regulatory authority may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our partners that may be expensive and time consuming to fulfill.\nIf we or others identify side effects after any of our medicines are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur subsequent to regulatory approval, or if we, our manufacturers or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we or our partners may, among other things, lose regulatory approval and be forced to withdraw products from the market, need to conduct additional clinical studies, incur restrictions on the marketing, distribution or manufacturing of the product, and/or change the labeling of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nWe depend on our collaboration with Biogen for the development and commercialization of SPINRAZA.\nWe have entered into a collaborative arrangement with Biogen to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA. We entered into this collaboration primarily to:\n\u25cf fund our development activities for SPINRAZA;\n\u25cf seek and obtain regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA; and\n\u25cf successfully commercialize SPINRAZA.\nWe are relying on Biogen to obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA, manufacture and successfully commercialize SPINRAZA. In general, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that Biogen devotes to our collaboration. If Biogen fails to further develop SPINRAZA, obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA, manufacture or commercialize SPINRAZA, or if Biogen\u2019s efforts are not effective, our business may be negatively affected.\nOur collaboration with Biogen may not continue for various reasons. Biogen can terminate our collaboration at any time. If Biogen stops developing or commercializing SPINRAZA, we would have to seek or spend additional funding, and SPINRAZA\u2019s commercialization may be harmed or delayed.\nOur collaboration with Biogen may not result in the continued successful commercialization of SPINRAZA. If Biogen does not continue to successfully commercialize SPINRAZA, we will receive limited revenues for SPINRAZA.\nIf we cannot optimize and maintain effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, we may not generate significant product revenue from TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA.\nTo successfully commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, we must effectively manage our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We may not be successful in doing so. To commercialize WAYLIVRA in the initial indications we are pursuing and to continue the commercialization of TEGSEDI, we will need to optimize and maintain specialty sales forces in the global regions where we currently market or expect to market TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, supported by case managers, reimbursement specialists, partnerships with specialty pharmacies, injection training, routine blood and urine monitoring and a medical affairs team.\nEven though certain members of our management team and other employees have experience commercializing medicines, as a whole we have limited experience marketing, selling and distributing medicines, and there are significant risks involved in building, tailoring, optimizing and managing a commercial infrastructure. We expect the recent Akcea Acquisition will result in significant turnover that could impair our ability to manage Akcea\u2019s business. If our efforts to integrate key Akcea employees into Ionis following the Akcea Acquisition are not successful, it could impair our ability to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nIt is expensive and time consuming for us to maintain our own sales forces and related compliance protocols to market TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. We may never successfully optimize or manage this capability and any failure could harm the commercial launch of WAYLIVRA or adversely affect TEGSEDI sales. Additionally, we and our partners will have to compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train, manage and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nWe have incurred expenses launching, optimizing and managing the marketing and sales infrastructure for TEGSEDI in Europe, Canada and the U.S., and WAYLIVRA in Europe. If regulatory requirements or other factors cause the commercialization of TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA to be less successful than expected in important markets, we would incur additional expenses for having invested in these capabilities prior to realizing any significant revenue from sales of TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA. Our sales force and marketing teams may not successfully commercialize TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA.\nTo the extent we decide to rely on third parties to commercialize TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA in a particular geographic market, we will have less control over sales efforts and may receive less revenue than if we commercialized TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA by ourselves. We have entered into agreements with third parties to commercialize our medicines as follows:\n\u25cf In December 2020, we entered into a distribution agreement with Sobi to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Europe;\n\u25cf In August 2018, we granted PTC the exclusive right to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries; and\n\u25cf In August 2018 we entered into an agreement with Accredo Health Group, Inc., or Accredo, a subsidiary of Express Scripts, to be our specialty pharmacy partner for distribution of TEGSEDI in the U.S.\nIf Sobi or PTC does not successfully commercialize TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA, including as a result of delays or disruption caused by the current COVID-19 Pandemic, we may receive limited revenue for TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA in Europe, Latin America or certain Caribbean countries.\nIf we cannot effectively build and manage our distribution, medical affairs, market access, marketing and sales infrastructure, or find a suitable third party to perform such functions, the sales of TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA may be adversely affected. Any such events may result in decreased sales and lower revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in response to the public health directives and orders related to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we implemented work-from-home policies for our employees globally and suspended business-related travel. We believe the effects of the government orders and our work-from-home and travel policies in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic have thus far had a limited impact on our productivity, business and commercialization efforts for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, but the effects of these orders and policies may become more significant in the future.\nOur operations are subject to additional healthcare laws.\nOur operations are subject to additional healthcare laws, including federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, such as the federal Sunshine Act, and health information privacy and security laws. Efforts to ensure that our operations comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. Penalties for violations of applicable healthcare laws and regulations may include significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we enter into a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, violations may also result in reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings.\nIf government or other third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, our revenue will be limited.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our current and future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. The majority of patients in the U.S. who would fit within our target patient populations for our medicines have their healthcare supported by a combination of Medicare coverage, other government health programs such as Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new medicines when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be enough to make our medicines affordable. Accordingly, SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA for FCS in the EU and, if approved, WAYLIVRA in the U.S. or Canada and for additional indications, and our medicines in development, will face competition from other therapies and medicines for limited financial resources. We or our partners may need to conduct post-marketing studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to satisfy third-party payers. These studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Third-party payers may never consider our future products as cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nThird-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medicines exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medicines can differ significantly from payer to payer. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. However, in March 2020, before the District Court could rule on the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments and is expected to rule on the case in its current session, which began in October 2020. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and healthcare reform measures will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. For example, in the U.S., recent health reform measures have resulted in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and legislation designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medicines and bring more transparency to drug pricing. Such restrictions may include legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices (e.g., by placing limits on pharmaceutical price increases and tying Medicare Part B drug prices to international drug prices), increase competition (e.g., by allowing for personal importation of drugs from Canada), lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients (e.g., by capping Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses) and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. In November 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule modifying the anti-kickback law safe harbors for plans, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical benefit managers. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for medicines may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, and third-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, may allocate their resources to address the current COVID-19 Pandemic or experience delays or disruptions in their ability to devote resources to coverage and reimbursement matters related to our products or medicines as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, which would negatively affect the potential commercial success of our products, our revenue and our profits.\nIf we cannot manufacture our medicines or contract with a third party to manufacture our medicines at costs that allow us to charge competitive prices to buyers, we cannot market our products profitably.\nTo successfully commercialize any of our medicines, we would need to optimize and manage large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities either on a standalone basis or through a third-party manufacturer. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply the drug substance and drug product for TEGSEDI and drug product for WAYLIVRA. Any delays or disruption to our own or third-party commercial manufacturing capabilities, including any interruption to our supply chain as a result of the current COVID-19 Pandemic, could limit the commercial success of our medicines.\nIn addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products of the chemical class represented by our medicines, called oligonucleotides, on a commercial scale for the systemic administration of a medicine. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our medicines, and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. Further, we must continue to improve our manufacturing processes to allow us to reduce our drug costs. We or our partners may not be able to manufacture our medicines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make commercially successful products.\nAlso, manufacturers, including us, must adhere to the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and similar regulations in foreign countries, which the applicable regulatory authorities enforce through facilities inspection programs. We, our partners and our contract manufacturers may not comply or maintain compliance with cGMP, or similar foreign regulations. Non-compliance could significantly delay or prevent receipt of marketing authorizations for our medicines, including authorizations for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, or result in enforcement action after authorization that could limit the commercial success of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of our Medicines\nIf we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval for our medicines and additional approvals for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, we or our partners cannot sell them in the applicable markets.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our medicines will be considered safe and effective or will be approved for commercialization. In addition, it is possible that SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA may not be approved in additional markets or for additional indications. We and our partners must conduct time-consuming, extensive and costly clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of each of our medicines before they can be approved or receive additional approvals for sale. We and our partners must conduct these studies in compliance with FDA regulations and with comparable regulations in other countries.\nWe and our partners may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for our medicines. It is possible that regulatory agencies will not approve our medicines for marketing or SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA in additional markets or for additional indications. If the FDA or another regulatory agency believes that we or our partners have not sufficiently demonstrated the safety or efficacy of any of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, or our medicines in development, the agency will not approve the specific medicine or will require additional studies, which can be time consuming and expensive and which will delay or harm commercialization of the medicine. For example, in August 2018 we received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the new drug application for WAYLIVRA in which the FDA determined that the safety concerns identified with WAYLIVRA in our clinical development program outweighed the expected benefits of triglyceride lowering in patients with FCS. We also received a Non-W from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA in November 2018. We are engaged with the FDA and plan to work with Health Canada to confirm a path forward for WAYLIVRA.\nThe FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a medicine for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf such authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u25cf we or our partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a medicine is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u25cf such authorities may not accept clinical data from studies conducted at clinical facilities that have deficient clinical practices or that are in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the U.S.;\n\u25cf we or our partners may be unable to demonstrate that our medicine\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks to support approval;\n\u25cf such authorities may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u25cf such authorities may find deficiencies in our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers who manufacture clinical and commercial supplies for our medicines, or may delay the inspection of such facilities due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 Pandemic; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of such authorities or their prior guidance to us or our partners during clinical development may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFailure to receive marketing authorization for our medicines, or failure to receive additional marketing authorizations for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA, or delays in these authorizations could prevent or delay commercial introduction of the medicine, and, as a result, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from product sales.\nIf the results of clinical testing indicate that any of our medicines are not suitable for commercial use, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nDrug discovery and development has inherent risks and the historical failure rate for drugs is high. Antisense medicines are a relatively new approach to therapeutics. If we cannot demonstrate that our medicines are safe and effective for human use in the intended indication, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nIn the past, we have invested in clinical studies of medicines that have not met the primary clinical end points in their Phase 3 studies. Similar results could occur in clinical studies for our medicines, including the studies of tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx. If any of our medicines in clinical studies, including tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen,, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx, do not show sufficient efficacy in patients with the targeted indication, it could negatively impact our development and commercialization goals for these medicines and our stock price could decline.\nEven if our medicines are successful in preclinical and human clinical studies, the medicines may not be successful in late-stage clinical studies.\nSuccessful results in preclinical or initial human clinical studies, including the Phase 2 results for some of our medicines in development, may not predict the results of subsequent clinical studies, including the studies of tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx. There are a number of factors that could cause a clinical study to fail or be delayed, including:\n\u25cf the clinical study may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\u25cf regulators may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf we, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could suspend or terminate a clinical study due to adverse side effects of a medicine on subjects in the trial;\n\u25cf we, or our partners, may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical studies;\n\u25cf enrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;\n\u25cf we or our partners, including our independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers on which we rely, may not identify, recruit and train suitable clinical investigators at a sufficient number of study sites or timely enroll a sufficient number of study subjects in the clinical study;\n\u25cf the institutional review board for a prospective site might withhold or delay its approval for the study;\n\u25cf enrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;\n\u25cf people who enroll in the clinical study may later drop out due to adverse events, a perception they are not benefiting from participating in the study, fatigue with the clinical study process or personal issues;\n\u25cf a clinical study site may deviate from the protocol for the study;\n\u25cf the cost of our clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf our partners may decide not to exercise any existing options to license and conduct additional clinical studies for our medicines; and\n\u25cf the supply or quality of our medicines or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed.\nThe current COVID-19 Pandemic could make some of these factors more likely to occur.\nIn addition, our current medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, are chemically similar to each other. As a result, a safety observation we encounter with one of our medicines could have, or be perceived by a regulatory authority to have, an impact on a different medicine we are developing. This could cause the FDA and other regulators to ask questions or take actions that could harm or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our medicines or increase our costs. For example, the FDA or other regulatory agencies could request, among other things, any of the following regarding one of our medicines: additional information or commitments before we can start or continue a clinical study, protocol amendments, increased safety monitoring, additional product labeling information, and post-approval commitments. This happened in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, as the EC is requiring us to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. We have an ongoing OLE extension study of WAYLIVRA in patients with FCS and an OLE study of TEGSEDI in patients with hATTR, and an early access program, or EAP, for WAYLIVRA. Adverse events or results from these studies or the EAPs could negatively impact our pending or future marketing approval applications for WAYLIVRA and TEGSEDI in patients with FCS or hATTR amyloidosis or the commercial opportunity for WAYLIVRA or TEGSEDI.\nAny failure or delay in the clinical studies, including the studies of tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx, could reduce the commercial potential or viability of our medicines.\nWe depend on third parties to conduct our clinical studies for our medicines and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct our clinical studies for our medicines and expect to continue to do so in the future. For example, we use clinical research organizations, such as Pharmaceutical Research Associates, Inc., Icon Clinical Research Limited, Syneos Health, Inc., PPD and Medpace for the clinical studies for our medicines, including tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical studies, but do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees. However, we are responsible for ensuring that these third parties conduct each of our clinical studies in accordance with the general investigational plan and approved protocols for the study. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations, including as a result of delays or disruption caused by the current COVID-19 Pandemic that may affect the third party\u2019s ability to conduct the clinical studies for our medicines, or a termination of our relationship with these third parties could delay or prevent the development, marketing authorization and commercialization of our medicines or additional marketing authorizations for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nSince corporate partnering is a significant part of our strategy to fund the advancement and commercialization of our development programs, if any of our collaborative partners fail to fund our collaborative programs, or if we cannot obtain additional partners, we may have to delay or stop progress on our drug development programs.\nTo date, corporate partnering has played a significant role in our strategy to fund our development programs and to add key development resources. We plan to continue to rely on additional collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize many of our unpartnered medicines. However, we may not be able to negotiate favorable collaborative arrangements for these drug programs. If we cannot continue to secure additional collaborative partners, our revenues could decrease and the development of our medicines could suffer.\nOur corporate partners are developing and/or funding many of the medicines in our development pipeline. For example, we are relying on:\n\u25cf Roche for development and funding of tominersen;\n\u25cf Novartis for development and funding of pelacarsen; and\n\u25cf Biogen for development and funding of tofersen.\nIf any of these pharmaceutical companies stops developing and/or funding these medicines, our business could suffer and we may not have, or be willing to dedicate, the resources available to develop these medicines on our own. Our collaborators can terminate their relationships with us under certain circumstances, many of which are outside of our control. For example, as part of a reprioritization of its pipeline and strategic review of its rare disease business, GSK declined its option to license TEGSEDI and IONIS-FB-LRx.\nEven with funding from corporate partners, if our partners do not effectively perform their obligations under our agreements with them, it would delay or stop the progress of our drug development and commercial programs.\nIn addition to receiving funding, we enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to:\n\u25cf conduct clinical studies;\n\u25cf seek and obtain marketing authorization; and\n\u25cf manufacture, market and sell our medicines.\nOnce we have secured a collaborative arrangement to further develop and commercialize one of our drug development programs, such as our collaborations with AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche, these collaborations may not continue or result in commercialized medicines, or may not progress as quickly as we first anticipated.\nFor example, a collaborator such as AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis, Pfizer or Roche, could determine that it is in its financial interest to:\n\u25cf pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products that may be competitive with the medicine that is part of the collaboration with us;\n\u25cf pursue higher-priority programs or change the focus of its own development programs; or\n\u25cf choose to devote fewer resources to our medicines than it does for its own medicines.\nIf any of these occur, it could affect our partner\u2019s commitment to the collaboration with us and could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, tominersen, pelacarsen and tofersen.\nIf we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, the price of our securities could decrease.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate and may disclose the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when we anticipate a certain medicine will enter clinical trials, when we anticipate completing a clinical study, or when we anticipate filing an application for, or obtaining, marketing authorization, or when we or our partners plan to commercially launch a medicine. We base our estimates on present facts and a variety of assumptions, many of which are outside of our control, including the current COVID-19 Pandemic. If we do not achieve milestones in accordance with our or our investors\u2019 or securities analysts\u2019 expectations, including milestones related to SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx, the price of our securities could decrease.\nRisks Associated with our Businesses as a Whole\nRisks related to our financial results\nWe have incurred losses, and our business will suffer if we fail to consistently achieve profitability in the future.\nBecause drug discovery and development requires substantial lead-time and money prior to commercialization, our expenses have generally exceeded our revenue since we were founded in January 1989. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.2 billion and stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $0.8 billion. Most of our historical losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Most of our income has come from collaborative arrangements, including commercial revenue from royalties and R&D revenue, with additional income from the sale or licensing of our patents, as well as interest income. If we do not continue to earn substantial revenue, we may incur additional operating losses in the future. We may not successfully develop any additional products or achieve or sustain future profitability.\nIf we fail to obtain timely funding, we may need to curtail or abandon some of our programs.\nMany of our medicines are undergoing clinical studies or are in the early stages of research and development. Most of our drug programs will require significant additional research, development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, marketing authorization, preclinical activities and commitment of significant additional resources prior to their successful commercialization. These activities will require significant cash. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments equal to $1.9 billion. If we or our partners do not meet our goals to successfully commercialize our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, or to license certain medicines and proprietary technologies, we will need additional funding in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, such as the following:\n\u25cf successful commercialization of SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA;\n\u25cf additional marketing approvals for WAYLIVRA and TEGSEDI;\n\u25cf the profile and launch timing of our medicines, including TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA;\n\u25cf the results of the clinical studies of tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx;\n\u25cf changes in existing collaborative relationships and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements;\n\u25cf continued scientific progress in our research, drug discovery and development programs;\n\u25cf the size of our programs and progress with preclinical and clinical studies;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in obtaining marketing authorizations; and\n\u25cf competing technological and market developments, including the introduction by others of new therapies that address our markets.\nIf we need additional funds, we may need to raise them through public or private financing. Additional financing may not be available at all or on acceptable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the shares of existing stockholders will be diluted and the price, as well as the price of our other securities, may decline. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may have to cut back on one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs. Alternatively, we may obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others, which could require us to give up rights to certain of our technologies or medicines.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we cannot protect our patent rights or our other proprietary rights, others may compete more effectively against us.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon whether we can continue to develop, secure and maintain intellectual property rights to proprietary products and services. However, we may not receive issued patents on any of our pending patent applications in the U.S. or in other countries and we may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights which could impact our ability to compete effectively. In addition, the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, other parties may successfully challenge, invalidate or circumvent our issued patents or patents licensed to us so that our patent rights do not create an effective competitive barrier or revenue source.\nWe cannot be certain that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and courts in the U.S. or the patent offices and courts in foreign countries will consider the claims in our patents and applications covering SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, or any of our medicines in development as patentable. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent, including through legal action.\nIf we or any licensor partner loses or cannot obtain patent protection for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, or any of our other medicines in development, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIntellectual property litigation could be expensive and prevent us from pursuing our programs.\nFrom time to time we have to defend our intellectual property rights. If we are involved in an intellectual property dispute, we may need to litigate to defend our rights or assert them against others. Disputes can involve arbitration, litigation or proceedings declared by the U.S. PTO or the International Trade Commission or foreign patent authorities. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIf a third-party claims that our medicines or technology infringe its patents or other intellectual property rights, we may have to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease certain activities. We may not be able to obtain a license to needed intellectual property on favorable terms, if at all. There are many patents issued or applied for in the biotechnology industry, and we may not be aware of patents or patent applications held by others that relate to our business. This is especially true since patent applications in the U.S. are filed confidentially for the first 18 months. Moreover, the validity and breadth of biotechnology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues remain.\nRisks related to our business strategy and personnel\nIf we fail to successfully integrate Akcea\u2019s business and operations, it may adversely affect our future results.\nWe believe our Akcea Acquisition will result in certain benefits, including a single vision and set of strategic priorities, led by one team, accelerating our next phase of growth and positioning us to more effectively deliver our medicines to patients. Under this transaction, Ionis will now retain more value from Akcea\u2019s pipeline and commercial products, further strengthening our financial position and supporting continued investments in our future. The success of the transaction will depend on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Akcea Acquisition for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf failure to successfully manage relationships with partners, customers, distributors and suppliers;\n\u25cf disruptions to Akcea\u2019s commercial operations;\n\u25cf potential incompatibility of technologies and systems;\n\u25cf failure to leverage the capabilities of the combined company quickly and effectively;\n\u25cf potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing business systems and processes;\n\u25cf tax benefits of the combined structure may not be available or in the expected amounts; and\n\u25cf the loss of key employees.\nIf our management transition is not successful our business could suffer.\nIn January 2020, Dr. Crooke, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, transitioned from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors. As Executive Chairman, Dr. Crooke continues to be responsible for the activities of the board and remains active in the company, providing strategic advice and continuing to participate in the scientific activities. Starting in January 2020, Dr. Monia, who had been our Chief Operating Officer from January 2018 to January 2020 and has been a member of our team since our founding over 30 years ago, serves as our Chief Executive Officer. Following our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in June, Dr. Crooke will retire from Ionis and its board of directors but will continue to serve as a scientific advisor. If this transition is not successful, our business could suffer.\nThe loss of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, could make it more difficult to run our business and reduce our likelihood of success.\nWe are dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers that would prevent them from leaving us. The loss of our management and key scientific employees might slow the achievement of important research and development goals. It is also critical to our success that we recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work. We may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced scientific personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition for experienced scientists among many pharmaceutical and health care companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel. Similarly, if we cannot recruit and retain qualified marketing, sales and distribution personnel, our ability to effectively implement our new commercial strategy following the Akcea Acquisition will be adversely affected.\nRisks related to taxes\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryovers and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses, or NOLs, carried over from a prior taxable year. Under that provision, we can carryforward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits.\nUnder the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal net operating losses is limited to 80 percent of taxable income beginning in 2021. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal Tax Act or the CARES Act. The CARES Act also reinstated the net operating loss carryback provisions whereby net operating losses incurred in calendar tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020 may be carried back to offset taxable income of the five tax years preceding the year of the loss.\nAt the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, in June 2020, California enacted Assembly Bill 85 (AB 85), which suspends NOLs and limits credit utilization to $5 million per year for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 tax years. AB 85 did not have a material impact on our 2020 tax provision, but it is possible that it may in future years.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. As a result of the Akcea Acquisition, we will be subject to the Separate Return Limitation Year, or SRLY, Rules. Under SRLY, our utilization of Akcea\u2019s pre-acquisition net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be limited to the amount of income that Akcea contributes to our consolidated taxable income. The Akcea pre-acquisition tax attributes cannot be used to offset any of the income that Ionis contributes to our consolidated taxable income.\nWe have assessed our valuation allowances requirements, both federal and state, due to the Akcea Acquisition, and have also assessed whether Akcea may rejoin our consolidated tax group. For details regarding these assessments, see Note 5, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur future taxable income could be impacted by changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and sales taxes in the U.S. and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and transaction taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.\nGeneral risk factors\nIf the price of our securities continues to be highly volatile, this could make it harder for you to liquidate your investment and could increase your risk of suffering a loss.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of many other biopharmaceutical companies, has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. These fluctuations in our common stock price may significantly affect the trading price of our securities. During the 12 months preceding December 31, 2020, the market price of our common stock ranged from $64.34 to $39.32 per share. Many factors can affect the market price of our securities, including, for example, fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of collaborations, clinical study results, technological innovations or new products being developed by us or our competitors, the commercial success of our approved medicines, governmental regulation, marketing authorizations, changes in payers\u2019 reimbursement policies, developments in patent or other proprietary rights and public concern regarding the safety of our medicines.\nThe current COVID-19 Pandemic has caused a significant disruption of global financial markets and has resulted in increased volatility in the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, broad market and industry factors may also materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and NASDAQ and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for biotechnology or pharmaceutical stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, convertible notes documents, call spread hedge transaction documents and Delaware law may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for classified terms for the members of our board of directors. Our certificate also includes a provision that requires at least 66 2/3 percent of our voting stockholders to approve a merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, any holder of 15 percent or more of our voting stock, except in cases where certain directors approve the transaction or certain minimum price criteria and other procedural requirements are met.\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent. In addition, only our board of directors, chairman of the board or chief executive officer can call special meetings of our stockholders. We have in the past, and may in the future, implement a stockholders\u2019 rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of, and issue shares of preferred stock, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company without action by our stockholders.\nThe provisions of our convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or a portion of their notes, which may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market prices.\nIn December 2019, we entered into privately negotiated exchange and/or subscription agreements with certain new investors and certain holders of our existing 1% Notes to exchange $375.6 million of our 1% Notes for $439.3 million of our 0.125% Notes, and to issue $109.5 million of our 0.125% Notes. Additionally, in connection with the pricing of our 0.125% Notes, we entered into call spread transactions in which we purchased note hedges and sold warrants. Terminating or unwinding the call spread transactions could require us to make substantial payments to the counterparties under those agreements or may increase our stock price. The costs or any increase in stock price that may arise from terminating or unwinding such agreements could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser.\nThese provisions, as well as Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and other of our agreements, may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interests.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect trading prices of our securities. For example, we may issue approximately 11.2 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible senior notes and up to 6.6 million shares may be issued in connection with the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of our 0.125% Notes, in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The addition of any of these shares into the public market may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities.\nIn addition, pursuant to the call spread transactions we entered into in connection with the pricing of our 0.125% Notes, the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time at or prior to the conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock, other of our securities, or other instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, that they may wish to use in connection with such hedging, which may have a negative effect on the conversion value of those notes and an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. The call spread transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of our 0.125% Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 0.125% Notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future or at all.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic products, including potential product liability claims related to SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development. We have clinical study insurance coverage and commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims against us, or be available to us at an acceptable cost, if at all. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our medicines, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical study volunteers and loss of revenues. Thus, whether or not we are insured, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, which exposes us to data security risks.\nWe are dependent upon our own and third-party information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, disruption of data integrity, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, data privacy or security incidents or breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, with third-party phishing and social engineering attacks in particular increasing in connection with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. A security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to financial penalties and mandatory and costly corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, any of which could disrupt our business and result in increased costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure, our efforts may not prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store most of these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at our facilities in Carlsbad, California pending ultimate use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause:\n\u25cf interruption of our research, development and manufacturing efforts;\n\u25cf injury to our employees and others;\n\u25cf environmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and\n\u25cf liabilities under federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and human safety, as well as the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and resultant waste products.\nIn such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research, development or manufacturing efforts caused by contamination, and the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster strikes our research, development or manufacturing facilities or otherwise affects our business, it could delay our progress developing and commercializing our medicines.\nWe manufacture most of our research and clinical supplies in a manufacturing facility located in Carlsbad, California. We manufacture the finished drug product for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA at third-party contract manufacturers. Biogen manufactures the finished drug product for SPINRAZA. The facilities and the equipment we, our partners and our contract manufacturers use to research, develop and manufacture our medicines would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Our facilities or those of our partners or contract manufacturers may be harmed by natural or man-made disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, fires, acts of terrorism and pandemics; and if such facilities are affected by a disaster, our development and commercialization efforts would be delayed. Although we possess property damage and business interruption insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the U.S. government, including the FDA.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nEach year we are required to evaluate our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on and our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to attest to, our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our management\u2019s time to comply with these regulations. In addition, if we cannot continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nThe SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt, or where the SEC has adopted, additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business.\nNegative conditions in the global credit markets and financial services and other industries may adversely affect our business.\nThe global credit markets, the financial services industry, the U.S. capital markets, and the U.S. economy as a whole are currently experiencing substantial turmoil and uncertainty characterized by unprecedented intervention by the U.S. federal government in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In the past, the failure, bankruptcy, or sale of various financial and other institutions created similar turmoil and uncertainty in such markets and industries. It is possible that a crisis in the global credit markets, the U.S. capital markets, the financial services industry or the U.S. economy may adversely affect our business, vendors and prospects, as well as our liquidity and financial condition. More specifically, our insurance carriers and insurance policies covering all aspects of our business may become financially unstable or may not be sufficient to cover any or all of our losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business and marketing our medicines internationally could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we are commercializing TEGSEDI in the EU and Canada, and WAYLIVRA in the EU. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. Because we have international operations we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u25cf compliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for our medicines and foreign employees;\n\u25cf complexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf in certain circumstances, increased dependence on the commercialization efforts and regulatory compliance of third-party distributors or strategic partners;\n\u25cf foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n\u25cf U.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism, political instability or public health issues or pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 Pandemic, in particular foreign countries or globally;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations related to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf compliance with tax, employment, privacy, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.; and\n\u25cf changes in diplomatic and trade relationships.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the E.U. could increase these risks.\nOur business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010. In many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, any dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all employees and third-party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe impact on us of the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union cannot be predicted.\nThe withdrawal of the UK from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our medicines in the EU, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our medicines into the EU, and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our medicines in the EU.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period that ended December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. A trade and cooperation agreement, or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, that outlines the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU was agreed in December 2020.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the UK applicable to our business and our medicines is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and may continue to have, a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our medicines in the UK or the EU. For example, Great Britain is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA and, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market our medicines in Great Britain. It is currently unclear whether the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would delay or prevent us from commercializing our medicines in the UK or the EU.\nWhile the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the UK and the EU, there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the UK diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future. We could therefore, both now and in the future, face significant additional expenses (when compared to the position prior to the end of the Transition Period) to operate our business.", "PERMNO": 76661, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "IONS"}
