Risk Factors\nThe nature of the business activities conducted by Swift Energy subjects it to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of the major risks relating to our business activities:\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Commodity prices have dropped substantially and rapidly since September 2014. Continued low prices or their further downward movement would adversely affect our liquidity, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur future revenues, net income, cash flow, and the value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and have dropped precipitously over the past six months, especially in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015.\nContinued low price levels or further decreases in price levels for either oil or natural gas would negatively affect us in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nour cash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital expenditures;\n\u2022\ncertain reserves would no longer be economic to produce, leading to both lower cash flow and lower proved reserves;\n\u2022\nour lenders could reduce the borrowing base under our bank credit facility because of lower oil and natural gas reserves values, reducing our liquidity and possibly requiring mandatory loan repayments; and\n\u2022\nsuch a reduction may result in a downward adjustment to our estimated proved reserves, and require write-downs of our oil and gas properties.\nThe effects of current or lower oil and gas prices could require us to amend financial covenants in our credit facility.\nOur revolving credit facility contains both an adjusted working capital ratio covenant and an interest coverage ratio covenant (as defined in our Credit Agreement in exhibit 10.8 to this Form 10-K; see also Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of these ratios). Continuation of low oil prices or their further deterioration could significantly reduce cash flow, which is a critical underpinning of these ratios. If this were to occur, it could be necessary to negotiate for an amendment to one or both of these financial covenants.\nIf low commodity prices continue for an extended period it could negatively affect our cash flows, which would reduce our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness was approximately $1.1 billion, however the company has continued to borrow under the credit facility since that time. As of December 31, 2014, our total debt comprised approximately 57% of our total capitalization and in 2014 we spent approximately 25% of our net cash provided by operating activities on interest payments. In addition, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. A high level of debt could adversely affect us in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to repay or make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe estimate that we will use a significant portion of our 2015 cash flows to pay interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, capital expenditures, or other business activities;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our interest expense could increase if we deem it necessary to borrow additional amounts; and\n\u2022\nour debt levels could limit our future business flexibility, including the necessity to sell assets at prices below market values.\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect operations and raise issues related to maintaining certain properties.\nWhile a portion of our leases are held by production, other leases require us to drill new wells in order to maintain the lease. Lower liquidity and other capital constraints may make it difficult to drill those wells prior to the lease expiration dates, which could result in our losing proved undeveloped reserves and production.\nOur development operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital at satisfactory levels, which could lead to declines in our cash flow or in our oil and natural gas reserves, or a loss of properties.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. Although our 2014 total capital expenditures, including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions, drilling and infrastructure, were approximately $364 million, our 2015 capital expenditure budget has been\nreduced to between $110 to $125 million. Cash flow from operations is the principal source we intend to use for financing our future capital expenditures in 2015. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u2022our ability to borrow under our credit facility;\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells; and\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nCash flow from our operations and other capital resources may be insufficient to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures. If we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be required to curtail our operations even further, which in turn could lead to declines in our cash flows, or in our oil and natural gas reserves, or in a loss of properties.\nFor both 2014 and 2013, we have written down the carrying values on our oil and gas properties and could incur additional write-downs in the future.\nThe SEC accounting rules require that on a quarterly basis we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible write-down or impairment (the \"ceiling test\"). Any capital costs in excess of the ceiling amount must be permanently written down. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we reported non-cash write-downs on a before-tax basis of $445.4 million ($287.3 million after-tax) and $46.9 million ($30.0 million after tax), respectively, on our oil and gas properties. If oil and natural gas prices remain at their current low levels or decline further from the prices used in calculating the fourth quarter of 2014 ceiling test, we could be required to record additional non-cash write-downs of oil and gas properties as early as the first quarter of 2015, as the prices previously used in the ceiling test may be replaced by lower prices during 2015. Refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the ceiling test calculation.\nFederal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing using fluids other than diesel is currently exempt from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, but opponents of hydraulic fracturing have called for further study of the technique's environmental effects and, in some cases, a moratorium on the use of the technique. Various committees of Congress have been investigating hydraulic fracturing practices and several proposals have been submitted to Congress that, if implemented, would subject all hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Further, the EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. Several states have adopted or are otherwise considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, including restrictions on its use in environmentally sensitive areas. Some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities, or are considering doing so.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the ORD's study or the requirements of any additional federal or state legislation or regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal or state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay or halt our ability to develop oil and gas reserves.\nOur ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nDrilling activities require the use of fresh water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process which we employ to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs, including the Eagle Ford Shale, require the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient aquifer capacity to provide a local source of water for drilling activities. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site.\nOur inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIf we cannot replace our reserves, our revenues and financial condition will suffer.\nUnless we successfully replace our reserves, our long-term production will decline, which could result in lower revenues and cash flow. When our capital expenditures are limited to funding from our cash flow in lower commodity price environments, or when oil and natural gas prices decrease, our cash flow decreases, resulting in less available cash to drill and replace our reserves and an increased need to draw on our credit facility or generate funds through property sales or joint ventures, neither of which can be assured. Even if we have the capital to drill new wells, unsuccessful wells can hurt our efforts to replace reserves. Additionally, lower oil and natural gas prices can have the effect of lowering our reserves estimates and the number of economically viable prospects that we have to drill.\nOur business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities, some of which are owned by others.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties an area in which we have been affected by constraints for periods of time. The unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas.\nEstimates of proved reserves are uncertain, and revenues from production may vary significantly from expectations.\nThe quantities and values of our proved reserves included in our 2014 estimates of proved reserves are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates.\nAny significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. In addition, results of drilling, testing, production, and changes in prices after the date of the estimates of our reserves may result in substantial downward revisions. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 66% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserves data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, which may not occur.\nOur Southeast Louisiana core area could occasionally be affected by hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in pipeline outages or damage to production facilities, causing production delays and/or significant repair costs.\nApproximately 6% of our 2014 reserves, 12% of our 2014 production and 23% of our 2014 revenues were located in our Southeast Louisiana core area. Increased hurricane activity over the past six years has resulted in production curtailments and physical damage to our Gulf Coast operations. For example, a significant percentage of our production was shut down by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, and by Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Since we do not carry business interruption insurance (loss of production), if hurricanes damage the Gulf Coast region where we have a significant percentage of our operations, our cash flow would suffer. This decrease in cash flow, depending on the extent of the decrease, could reduce the funds we would have available for capital expenditures and reduce our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.\nA worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity,\nbusiness and financial condition that we cannot control or predict.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect the financial viability of and increase the credit risk associated with our purchasers, suppliers, insurers, and commodity derivative counterparties to perform under the terms of contracts or financial arrangements we have with them. Although we have heightened our level of scrutiny of our contractual counterparties, our assessment of the risk of non-performance by various parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets. This same crisis may adversely impact insurers and their ability to pay current and future insurance claims that we may have.\nOur future access to capital could be limited due to tightening credit markets that could affect our ability to fund our future capital projects. In addition, long-term restriction upon or freezing of the capital markets and legislation related to financial and banking reform may affect short-term or long-term liquidity.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves high risks and we may suffer uninsured losses.\nThese risks include blowouts, explosions, adverse weather effects and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and gas industry, it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, such as business interruption, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining and carrying such insurance.\nDrilling wells is speculative and capital intensive.\nDeveloping and exploring properties for oil and natural gas requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling or completion of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nhurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas, or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contaminates\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions; and\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial condition.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nThere is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities, if at all, to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells,\nmore fully explored prospects, or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. In addition, a variety of factors, including geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. For example, if oil and natural gas prices are much lower after we complete a well than when we identified it as a prospect, the completed well may not yield commercially viable quantities.\nWe may have difficulty competing for oil and gas properties, equipment, supplies, oilfield services, and trained and experienced personnel.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, competing with major integrated and independent energy companies for desirable oil and natural gas properties, as well as for the equipment, labor, and materials required to develop and operate such properties. Many of these competitors have financial and technological resources substantially greater than ours. The market for oil and natural gas properties is highly competitive and we may lack technological information or expertise available to other bidders. We may incur higher costs or be unable to acquire and develop desirable properties at costs we consider reasonable because of this competition. As demand increases for equipment, services, and personnel, we may experience increased costs and various shortages and may not be able to obtain the necessary oilfield services and trained personnel.\nGovernmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection are costly and stringent.\nOur exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws, regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. In addition, some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators. Changes in, or additions to, environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or other environmental protection requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nEnactment of legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.\nNumerous legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) climate change/carbon tax legislation introduced in Congress, and EPA regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (2) proposals contained in the President's budget, along with legislation introduced in Congress (none of which have passed), to impose new taxes on, or repeal various tax deductions available to, oil and gas producers, such as the current tax deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, which deductions, if eliminated, could raise the cost of energy production, reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities; and (3) legislation previously considered by Congress (but not adopted) that would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and new or anticipated Department of Interior and EPA regulations to impose new and more stringent regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, particularly those performed on federal lands, and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Any of the foregoing described proposals could affect our operations, and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.\nIn recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits and deductions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the increase of the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses, (iii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iv) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production\nactivities. It is currently unclear whether any such proposals will be enacted or what form they might possibly take. The passage of such legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate, reduce or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. New or modified rules, regulations or requirements may increase the cost and availability to our counterparties of their hedging and swap positions which they can make available to us, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivative activities.\nWhile many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and (iv) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.\nLegal proceedings could result in liability affecting our results of operations\nMost oil and gas companies, such as us, are involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters.\nBecause we maintain a portfolio of assets in the various areas in which we operate, the complexity and types of legal procedures with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.", "PERMNO": 66739, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SBOW"}
