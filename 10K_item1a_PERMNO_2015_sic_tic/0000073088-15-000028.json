RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as all other information available to you, before making an investment in our common stock or other securities.\nWe are subject to potential unfavorable government and regulatory outcomes, including extensive and changing laws\nand regulations that affect our industry and our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn a return on our capital investment in our utility operations. We provide service at rates established by several regulatory commissions. These rates are generally set based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a historical test year. In addition, each regulatory commission sets rates based in part upon their acceptance of an allocated share of total utility costs. When commissions adopt different methods to calculate inter-jurisdictional cost allocations, some costs may not be recovered. Thus, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs.\nFor example, in our regulatory filings related to DGGS, we proposed an allocation of approximately 80% of costs to retail customers subject to the MPSC's jurisdiction and approximately 20% allocated to wholesale customers subject to FERC's jurisdiction. In March 2012, the MPSC's final order approved using our proposed cost allocation methodology, but requires us to complete a study of the relative contribution of retail and wholesale customers to regulation capacity needs. The results of this study may be used in determining future cost allocations between retail and wholesale customers. However, there is no assurance that both the MPSC and FERC will agree on the results of this study, which could result in an inability to fully recover our costs.\nIn April 2014, the FERC issued an order affirming a FERC Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) initial decision in September 2012, regarding cost allocation at DGGS between retail and wholesale customers. This decision concluded we should allocate only a fraction of the costs we believe, based on facts and the law, should be allocated to FERC jurisdictional customers. We filed a request for rehearing, which remains pending. If unsuccessful on rehearing, we may appeal to a United States Circuit Court of Appeals, which could extend into 2016 or beyond. The FERC order was assessed as a triggering event as to whether an impairment charge should be recorded with respect to DGGS. We continue to evaluate options to use DGGS in combination with other generation resources to ensure cost recovery, and do not believe an impairment loss is probable at this time. Any alternative use of DGGS would be subject to regulatory approval and we cannot provide assurance of such approval. We will continue to evaluate recovery of this asset in the future as facts and circumstances change. If we are not able to ensure cost recovery of DGGS we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are subject to many FERC rules and orders that regulate our electric and natural gas business. We must also comply with established reliability standards and requirements, which apply to the NERC functions in both the MRO for our South Dakota operations and the WECC for our Montana operations. The FERC, NERC, or a regional reliability organization may assess penalties against any responsible entity that violates their rules, regulations or standards. Violations may be discovered through various means, including self-certification, self-reporting, compliance investigations, periodic data submissions, exception reporting, and complaints. Penalties for the most severe violations can reach as high as $1 million per violation, per day. If a serious reliability incident or other incidence of noncompliance did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nTo the extent our incurred supply costs are deemed imprudent by the applicable state regulatory commissions, we would not recover some of our costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas supply are recovered through various pass-through cost tracking mechanisms in each of the states we serve. The rates are established based upon projected market prices or contractual obligations. As these variables change, we adjust our rates through our monthly trackers. To the extent our energy supply costs are deemed imprudent by the applicable state regulatory commissions, we would not recover some of our costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn October 2013, the MPSC concluded that $1.4 million of incremental costs associated with regulation service acquired from third parties during a 2012 outage at DGGS were imprudently incurred, and disallowed recovery. We have appealed that\ndecision to the Montana district court. In addition, our 2014 electric tracker filing includes market purchases made between July 2013 and January 2014 for replacement power during an outage at Colstrip Unit 4. Inclusion of these costs in the tracker filing is consistent with the treatment of replacement power during previous Colstrip outages. During a June 2014 MPSC work session, approximately $11 million of these incremental market purchases related to the Colstrip Unit 4 outage were identified by the MPSC for additional prudency review. In July 2014, the Montana Environmental Information Center and Sierra Club filed a petition to intervene in the consolidated 2013 and 2014 tracker dockets to challenge our recovery of costs associated with Colstrip Unit 4, particularly the costs incurred as a result of the outage, as imprudent. We believe the costs associated with the outage and incremental market purchases were prudently incurred. However, there is a risk that the MPSC may ultimately disallow all or a portion of these costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe currently procure a large portion of our natural gas supply through contracts with third-party suppliers. In light of this reliance on third-party suppliers, we are exposed to certain risks in the event a third-party supplier is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation. If this occurred, then we might be required to purchase natural gas supply in the market, which may not be on favorable terms, if at all. If prices were higher in the energy markets, it could result in a temporary material under recovery that would reduce our liquidity.\nWe have financial risks associated with our temporary ownership of the Kerr Project.\nThe MPSC order approving the Hydro Transaction provides that our customers will have no financial risk related to our temporary ownership of the Kerr Project, with a compliance filing to that effect required upon completion of the transfer of the project to CSKT. Accordingly, the Kerr Project and the associated assets are not included in our regulatory rate base. While we own the Kerr Project and taking into account purchased power commitments, we expect to have more generation output than our customers can use. The first-year revenue requirement for the Hydro Transaction includes revenue credits from the sale of generated electricity that exceeds our needs. The MPSC order approving the Hydro Transaction authorizes us to track these revenue credits on a portfolio basis. If the amount of electricity available for sale is lower than expected from our owned generation resources, or if the market prices for electricity that is sold are lower than expected, we may not realize the anticipated revenue credits. Market prices for electricity are currently very low and if revenues from sales to third parties during 2015 are lower than anticipated, the MPSC may disallow recovery of any shortfall in revenue credits.\nWe also bear the risk of any damage to the Kerr Project that occurs during our temporary ownership, except to the extent that costs associated with remediating any damage represent an addition or improvement to the Kerr Project that may increase the conveyance price pursuant to the Kerr Project license. The costs associated with such repairs could be substantial and may not be fully covered by any insurance. To the extent any such costs are not covered by insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Hydro Transaction.\nWe may be unable to achieve the strategic, operational, financial and other benefits, contemplated by us with respect to the Hydro Transaction to the full extent expected or in a timely manner. The integration of the facilities may be a complex and lengthy endeavor, and to the extent that we are not as successful as expected at integration, the cost savings, rate of return, accretion to earnings and cash flows, increased electricity generation, and other anticipated benefits and opportunities from the Hydro Transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur plans for future expansion through the acquisition of assets including natural gas reserves, capital improvements to current assets, generation investments, and transmission grid expansion involve substantial risks.\nAcquisitions include a number of risks, including but not limited to, additional costs, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations to the integration of the acquisition, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, securing adequate capital to support the transaction, and regulatory approval. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial synergies expected to result from an acquisition do not develop. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions that we may choose to undertake could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy also includes significant investment in capital improvements and additions to modernize existing infrastructure, generation investments and transmission capacity expansion. The completion of generation and natural gas investments and transmission projects are subject to many construction and development risks, including, but not limited to, risks related to permitting, financing, regulatory recovery, escalating costs of materials and labor, meeting construction budgets and schedules, and environmental compliance. In addition, these capital projects may require a significant amount of capital\nexpenditures. We cannot provide certainty that adequate external financing will be available to support such projects. Additionally, borrowings incurred to finance construction may adversely impact our leverage, which could increase our cost of capital.\nFactors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith the Hydro Transaction, we now derive a significant portion of our power supply from hydroelectric facilities. Because of our heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, snowpack, the timing of run-off, drought conditions, and the availability of water can significantly affect operations. If hydroelectric generation is lower than anticipated, we may need to increase our use of purchased power. We expect to recover purchased power costs through our electric tracker mechanism. Recovery of increased costs, however, could be subject to risk of disallowance that would negatively impact our results of operations, or may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, negatively affecting cash flows and liquidity.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations and potential environmental liabilities, which could result in significant costs and additional liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed by federal, state, and local government authorities in the ordinary course of operations with regard to the environment, including environmental laws and regulations relating to air and water quality, protection of natural resources, migratory birds and other wildlife, solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental considerations. We believe that we are in compliance with environmental regulatory requirements; however, possible future developments, such as more stringent environmental laws and regulations, and the timing of future enforcement proceedings that may be taken by environmental authorities, could affect our costs and the manner in which we conduct our business and could require us to make substantial additional capital expenditures or abandon certain projects.\nNational and international actions have been initiated to address global climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including, most significantly, carbon dioxide. These actions include legislative proposals, executive and EPA actions at the federal level, actions at the state level, and private party litigation relating to GHG emissions. As directed by President Obama's Climate Action Plan, on June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan rule to control carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel fired electric generating units. The EPA has expressed the intent to finalize those regulations and guidelines by midsummer 2015.\nRequirements to reduce GHG emissions from stationary sources could cause us to incur material costs of compliance and increase our costs of procuring electricity. Although there continues to be changes in legislation and regulations that affect GHG emissions from power plants, technology to efficiently capture, remove and/or sequester such emissions may not be available within a timeframe consistent with the implementation of such requirements. We cannot predict with any certainty whether these risks will have a material impact on our operations.\nMany of these environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial civil and criminal fines for noncompliance which, if imposed, could result in material costs or liabilities. In addition, there is a risk of environmental damages claims from private parties or government entities. We may be required to make significant expenditures in connection with the investigation and remediation of alleged or actual spills, personal injury or property damage claims, and the repair, upgrade or expansion of our facilities to meet future requirements and obligations under environmental laws.\nTo the extent that costs exceed our estimated environmental liabilities and/or we are not successful recovering a material portion of remediation costs in our rates, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur owned and jointly owned electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.\nOperation of electric generating facilities involves risks, which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Operational risks include facility shutdowns due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, labor disputes, operator error, catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, and intentional acts of destruction or other similar occurrences affecting the electric generating facilities; and operational changes necessitated by environmental legislation, litigation or regulation. The loss of a major electric generating facility would require us to find other sources of supply or ancillary services, if available, and expose us to higher purchased power costs.\nFor example, in early July 2013, following the return to service from a scheduled maintenance outage, Colstrip Unit 4 tripped off-line and incurred damage to its stator and rotor. Colstrip Unit 4 returned to service in early 2014. There is no\nassurance that we will be able to fully recover our costs for the purchase of replacement power while Colstrip Unit 4 was out of service.\nIn addition, during the second half of 2014, we experienced unscheduled outages at DGGS, due primarily to component failures within several of the gas generators and power turbines. We have continued to meet our regulation service responsibilities, and have not acquired replacement regulation service during this time. We are coordinating with PW Power Systems to complete repairs, which are expected to be complete by the first half of 2015. Although the plant is expected to remain in service throughout the repair period, the amount of available regulation service will vary as equipment is repaired and returned to service. We do not currently anticipate needing to acquire any regulation service from third parties during this time. If we should need to acquire regulation service, there can be no assurance that the MPSC and/or FERC would allow us full recovery of such costs.\nWe also rely on a limited number of suppliers of coal for our electric generation, making us vulnerable to increased prices for fuel as existing contracts expire or in the event of unanticipated interruptions in fuel supply. We are a captive rail shipper of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway for shipments of coal to the Big Stone Plant (our largest source of generation in South Dakota), making us vulnerable to railroad capacity and operational issues and/or increased prices for coal transportation from a sole supplier.\nOur revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage in our service territories and may fluctuate with current economic conditions or response to price increases. We are also impacted by market conditions outside of our service territories related to demand for transmission capacity and wholesale electric pricing.\nOur revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage, which can be impacted by population growth as well as by economic factors. Our customers may voluntarily reduce their consumption of electricity and natural gas from us in response to increases in prices, decreases in their disposable income, individual energy conservation efforts or the use of distributed generation for electricity.\nDemand for our Montana transmission capacity fluctuates with regional demand, fuel prices and weather related conditions. The levels of wholesale sales depend on the wholesale market price, transmission availability and the availability of generation, among other factors. Declines in wholesale market price, availability of generation, transmission constraints in the wholesale markets, or low wholesale demand could reduce wholesale sales. These events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur electric and natural gas operations involve numerous activities that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nInherent in our electric and natural gas operations are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as fires, electric contacts, leaks, explosions and mechanical problems. These risks could cause a loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial financial losses to us and others. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. For our natural gas distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damages resulting from these risks potentially is greater.\nPoor investment performance of plan assets of our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans, in addition to other factors impacting these costs, could unfavorably impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments and interest rates have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on economic conditions, actual stock market performance and changes in governmental regulations. Without sustained growth in the plan assets over time and depending upon interest rate changes as well as other factors noted above, the costs of such plans reflected in our results of operations and financial position and cash funding obligations may change significantly from projections.\nOur obligation to include a minimum annual quantity of power in our Montana electric supply portfolio at an agreed upon price per MWH could expose us to material commodity price risk if certain QFs under contract with us do not perform during a time of high commodity prices, as we are required to make up the difference. In addition, we are subject to price escalation risk with one of our largest QF contracts.\nAs part of a stipulation in 2002 with the MPSC and other parties, we agreed to include a minimum annual quantity of power in our Montana electric supply portfolio at an agreed upon price per MWH through June 2029. The annual minimum energy requirement is achievable under normal QF operations, including normal periods of planned and forced outages. However, to the extent the supplied QF power for any year does not reach the minimum quantity set forth in the settlement, we are obligated to purchase the difference from other sources. The anticipated source for any QF shortfall is the wholesale market, which would subject us to commodity price risk if the cost of replacement power is higher than contracted QF rates.\nIn addition, we are subject to price escalation risk with one of our largest QF contracts due to variable contract terms. In estimating our QF liability, we have estimated an annual escalation rate of 3% over the remaining term of the contract (through June 2024). To the extent the annual escalation rate exceeds 3%, our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected.\nWeather and weather patterns, including normal seasonal and quarterly fluctuations of weather, as well as extreme weather events that might be associated with climate change, could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur electric and natural gas utility business is seasonal, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our financial performance. Demand for electricity and natural gas is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our market areas, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. In the event that we experience unusually mild winters or cool summers in the future, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. Higher temperatures may also decrease the Montana snowpack, which may result in dry conditions and an increased threat of forest fires. Forest fires could threaten our communities and electric transmission lines and facilities. Any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, exceptionally hot summer weather or unusually cold winter weather could add significantly to working capital needs to fund higher than normal supply purchases to meet customer demand for electricity and natural gas.\nThere is also a concern that the physical risks of climate change could include changes in weather conditions, such as changes in the amount or type of precipitation and extreme weather events. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including increasing the cost incurred in providing electricity and natural gas, impacting the demand for and consumption of electricity and natural gas (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on our own and/or other systems may raise market prices as we buy short-term energy to serve our own system. Severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily through thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increase, this could increase our cost of providing service. Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could affect the availability of water for hydro generation and adversely affect our ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy. In addition, extreme weather may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure. We may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\nWe must meet certain credit quality standards. If we are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, our liquidity, access to capital and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA downgrade of our credit ratings to less than investment grade could adversely affect our liquidity. Certain of our credit agreements and other credit arrangements with counterparties require us to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash to support our obligations if we fall below investment grade. Also, a downgrade below investment grade could hinder our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, including through the commercial paper markets. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates or on incremental commercial paper issuances could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our business, or the businesses of third parties, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks (such as hacking and viruses) and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Our generation, transmission and\ndistribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities. Any significant interruption of these systems could prevent us from fulfilling our critical business functions, and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised.\nTerrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar events could harm our business by limiting our ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure assets, and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to the disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels. These events could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and reduced economic activity.", "PERMNO": 90458, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "NWE"}
