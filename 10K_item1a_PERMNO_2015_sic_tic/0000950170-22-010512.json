{"cik": "78749", "company": "AGILYSYS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nMarkets, Competition, and Operations\nOur business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions.\nBecause we conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), political unrest, armed conflicts (such as the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services.\nFor example, our business is impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. As discussed below under \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time,\u201d our performance has been affected by these conditions associated with COVID-19 and could be further materially affected going forward if these conditions continue for an additional extended period or in other circumstances that we are unable to foresee or mitigate. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities.\nSimilarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which may adversely affect demand for our customers\u2019 restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time.\nThe global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 has resulted in disruption to our business, the hospitality industry and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led government and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. Even as these restrictions have been relaxed in many parts of the world, including across the United States, they remain effective in other parts of the world and have frequently been re-imposed in many locations after having been relaxed as a result of additional outbreaks. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced demand for gaming, hotels, resorts, cruises, corporate foodservice, restaurants, university cafeterias, and stadiums and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across these hospitality industries that we serve, and in some cases, has caused the closure of our customers\u2019 businesses. Business closures have resulted in our inability to complete certain implementations and negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue.\nWe saw an improvement in the overall business environment and the hospitality market we serve during the second half of our fiscal 2021 (the year ended March 31, 2021) that continued through our fiscal 2022 as our customers re-opened their locations for business and our suppliers resumed operations that had been closed or reduced due to the pandemic. Based on the improved business\nenvironment and our financial performance, we have resumed certain levels of spending; however, we will continue to assess spending activity as the facts and circumstances surrounding the pandemic evolve. Any resulting cost controls may have an adverse impact on our business, particularly if they remain in place for an extended period. As the pandemic has evolved, we have also adapted our pandemic response based on the conditions of the locations in which we and our customers and suppliers operate. We expect to incur additional costs to the extent we further resume business-related travel and our employees return to our office locations, the timing and extent of which remains undetermined at this time. We expect the office activity will vary significantly from region to region based on factors such as the availability of vaccines and the spread and overall impact of any new virus variants.\nNotwithstanding the recovery in the business environment since the early part of the pandemic, given the uncertainty associated with the pandemic, our ability to predict how it will impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results in future periods is limited.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the supply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply costs, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance.\nOur business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer\u2019s needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including:\n\u2022Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers; and\n\u2022Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices.\nOur product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will, if ever, receive significant revenues from these investments.\nIf we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.\nSeveral companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future.\nWe compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or\nservices, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity.\nOur future success depends on our ability to execute on growth or strategic initiatives, properly manage investments in our business and operations, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute on other growth or strategic initiatives we are pursuing. A key element of our long-term strategy is to continue to invest in and grow our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions.\nInvestments in new markets, solutions, and technologies, R&D, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion, and headcount are critical components for achieving this strategy. In particular, we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. Our investments in research and development may result in products or services that generate less revenue than we anticipate.\nHowever, such investments and efforts present challenges and risks and may not be successful (financially or otherwise), especially in new areas in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our profitability in the short-term. To be successful in such efforts, we must be able to properly allocate limited investment funds and other resources, prioritize among opportunities, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new areas and the servicing of our existing customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas, or with the new solutions, in which we have invested.\nOur success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure, systems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new implementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems during or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting.\nIf we are unable to properly execute on growth initiatives, manage our investments, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected.\nOur dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these suppliers. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins.\nFor certain products and services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant risk exposure for us.\nWe maintain relationships with third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including cloud hosting and other cloud-based services. We make contractual obligations to customers based on these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these providers with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (that may include sensitive guest data). If these third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other difficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected, including, among other things, by facing increased costs, potential liability to customers, guests, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers because of poor performance, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially adversely impact our business.\nWe also purchase hardware and technology, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our competitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established providers wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be smaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally, or in an effort to benefit our margins.\nIf any of these providers experience financial, operational, or quality assurance difficulties, or if any cease production, or there is any other disruption in the services we or our customers receive, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a\ncompetitor, macroeconomic issues like those described above (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), or otherwise, we will be required to locate and migrate to alternative sources or providers, to internally develop the applicable technologies, to redesign our products, or to remove certain features from our products or to reduce our service levels, any of which would likely increase our expenses, create delays, or negatively impact our revenues. Although we strive to establish contractual protections with key providers, such as source code escrows, warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our relationship with a key provider is interrupted.\nIf we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, or if labor costs continue to rise, our ability to operate and grow our business may be impaired and our financial results may suffer.\nWe depend on the services of our management and employees to continuously run and grow our business. To grow successfully, we must retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, including in growth areas we may enter. Retention is an industry challenge given the competitive technology labor market, especially with the remote work options brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our workforce to execute on new and larger opportunities and challenges. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate and may be limited especially in technology areas. We may be at a disadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources or to start-ups or other emerging companies in trending market sectors. Remote employment arrangements also come with challenges, including with respect to collaboration, training, and corporate culture, especially at a significant scale. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel when and where they are needed or to manage effectively our remote workforce, our ability to operate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance our investments in personnel with revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nWhile the market for talent in our industry has been competitive for many years, in recent quarters, the labor market has become even tighter, increasing the difficulty and lead time in filling open positions with qualified candidates. Ongoing labor shortages or increasing labor costs could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, especially if rising costs outpace our revenue growth.\nOur international operations have many associated risks.\nWe continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and challenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.\nWe have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support channels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and difficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and managing foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; currency fluctuations; and political and economic instability abroad.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research and development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our administrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is concentrated in our India research and development center. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our employees throughout the world have been capable of working from home for months at a time without significantly impacting our business. However, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees\u2019 ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers.\nRegulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality\nCyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data against cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in the design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers.\nThe number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including sophisticated \u201csupply-chain\u201d attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks, anticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained therein, our customers and ultimately, our business.\nThese events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security such as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities.\nOur software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and implementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers\u2019 systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our software can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement.\nIf we fail to meet our customers\u2019 performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers\u2019 performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions, breaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions or breaches adversely impact our customers\u2019 businesses.\nIn addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers\u2019 businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability.\nRisks Relating to the Industries We Serve\nOur business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business and sales are largely dependent on the health of that industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, as discussed above, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. For additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, see \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time\u201d above for additional information.\nConsolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider\u2019s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nInsolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Most of our customers have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their\nlenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Finances and Capital Structure\nIf we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits.\nAs part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nSome of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had $32.8 million and $20.2 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. As of March 31, 2020, we determined the net realizable value of intangible assets consisting of capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in significantly lower sales and cash flow projections for the related rGuest solutions after evaluating the Company\u2019s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software. As a result, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred operating losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in our products. Our lack of consistent profitability limits the resources available to us to invest in developing new products, product upgrades and services and otherwise in improving business operations.\nOur stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2022, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $58.45 to a low close of $35.31. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u2022uncertainties the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for the global economy;\n\u2022economic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets;\n\u2022our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of securities analysts to publish reports about us or our business;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis; and\n\u2022any major change in our board or management; general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nOn May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $20.1676 per share. Dilution upon the conversion of the preferred stock in the future may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time.\nWe may encounter risks associated with maintaining large cash balances.\nWhile we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any.\nOther Risk Factors\nWe are subject to litigation, which may be costly.\nAs a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWhile we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.", "PERMNO": 63125, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "AGYS"}
