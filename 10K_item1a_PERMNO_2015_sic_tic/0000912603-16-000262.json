RISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are risks, which are categorized as \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Our Business,\u201d \u201cRisk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Our Employees,\u201d that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d that precedes Part I of this report. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n12 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nPotential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity\nIn December 2000, we were notified by the EPA under CERCLA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties (\u201cPRP\u201d) that owns or operates or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (the \u201cSite\u201d). The precise nature and extent of any cleanup of the Site, the parties to be involved, the process to be followed for any cleanup and the allocation of the costs for any cleanup among responsible parties have not yet been determined, but the process of identifying additional PRPs and beginning allocation of costs is underway. A group of PRPs referred to as the \u201cLower Willamette Group\u201d (\u201cLWG\u201d) is conducting a remedial investigation and feasibility study (\u201cRI/FS\u201d) to identify and characterize the contamination at the Site and develop alternative approaches to remediation of the contamination. On March 30, 2012, the LWG submitted to the EPA and made available on its website a draft feasibility study (\u201cFS\u201d) for the Site based on approximately ten years of work and $100 million in costs classified by the LWG as investigation related. The draft FS submitted by the LWG identified ten possible remedial alternatives which ranged in estimated cost from approximately $170 million to $250 million (net present value) for the least costly alternative to approximately $1.08 billion to $1.76 billion (net present value) for the most costly and estimated a range of two to 28 years to implement the remedial work, depending on the selected alternative. However, the EPA largely rejected this draft FS, and took over the drafting process. The EPA provided their revised draft FS to the LWG and other key stakeholders in sections, with the final section being made available in August 2015. The revised draft FS identified five possible remedial alternatives which ranged in estimated cost from approximately $550 million to $1.19 billion (net present value) for the least costly alternative to approximately $1.71 billion to $3.67 billion (net present value) for the most costly and estimated a range of four to 18 years to implement the remedial work, depending on the selected alternative.\nIn November 2015, EPA Region 10 presented its preferred alternative remedy to the National Remedy Review Board (\"NRRB\"), a peer review group that has been established to review proposed Superfund cleanup decisions for consistency with the Superfund statute, regulations, and guidance. EPA Region 10\u2019s preferred alternative presented to the NRRB was a modified version of one of the alternatives (Alternative E) in the revised draft FS, and EPA Region 10 estimated that its preferred alternative would take seven years to implement, with an estimated cost of $1.4 billion (net present value).\nIn June 2016, the EPA issued its Proposed Plan for the cleanup of the in-river portion of the Site. In the Proposed Plan, the EPA identified its preferred alternative, which includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery and which the EPA estimates will take approximately seven years to construct with additional time for monitored natural recovery to occur and cost an estimated $746 million (net present value). This is approximately half of the estimated $1.4 billion (net present value) cost of the very similar preferred alternative that EPA Region 10 presented in November 2015. The Proposed Plan also describes other alternatives that were considered and the criteria the EPA used to compare the alternatives, including estimated costs and construction timelines. In conjunction with the Proposed Plan, the EPA issued its final FS in June 2016. The final FS identifies eight possible remedial alternatives (some of which contain two disposal alternatives, for a total of 13 possible alternative remedial scenarios) which ranged in estimated cost from approximately $316 million to $677 million (net present value) for the least costly alternative to approximately $1.21 billion to $2.67 billion (net present value) for the most costly alternative that the EPA did not screen out and estimates a range of four to 19 years to implement the remedial work, depending on the selected alternative. The final FS includes one alternative (Alternative H) which would involve capping/dredging the entire Site with an estimated cost range from approximately $6.61 billion to $14.29 billion and 62 years to implement. The EPA screened out this Alternative H due to implementability and cost considerations. Each of the draft and final FS also contains a No Action alternative considered as a baseline for comparison with the other alternatives. The FS and the Proposed Plan do not determine or allocate the responsibility for remediation costs.\nIssuance of the Proposed Plan is part of the continuing process for evaluation and remediation of the Site. There was a 90-day public comment period on the Proposed Plan that closed on September 6, 2016. Approximately 5,300 commenters submitted comments. Following its review and consideration of these comments, the EPA will prepare a summary responding to the submitted comments and select a remedy for the Site in a Record of Decision (\u201cROD\u201d). The EPA has indicated that it plans to issue the ROD by the end of 2016 or in early January 2017. In the ROD, the EPA may modify the preferred alternative or select a different alternative than that presented in the Proposed Plan based on new information or public comments. It is uncertain whether the preferred alternative identified by the EPA in the Proposed Plan will be the selected remedy in the ROD or whether the EPA will be able to maintain its proposed schedule for issuing the ROD. Even when the ROD is issued, it is likely that there will continue to be significant uncertainty regarding the costs of the selected remedy.\n13 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nThe Company and other stakeholders have identified a number of serious concerns regarding the EPA's risk and remedial alternatives assessments and the EPA's cost estimates, scheduling assumptions and conclusions regarding the feasibility, effectiveness, community impact and assignment of remediation technologies. The EPA\u2019s FS and Proposed Plan are based on data that are more than a decade old and may not accurately represent site or background conditions. In its Proposed Plan, the EPA acknowledged that the assumptions used to estimate costs for the remedial alternatives were developed based on the existing data and will be finalized during the remedial design, after design level data to refine the baseline conditions are obtained. In addition, the FS and Proposed Plan provide only site-wide cost estimates and do not provide sufficient detail regarding costs for specific sediment management areas. Accordingly, it is anticipated that additional pre-remedial design investigative work will need to occur after the ROD is issued in order to provide a re-baseline for costs and determine particular remedial actions for specific areas within the Site.\nThe next phase in the process following the ROD is the remedial design. The remedial design phase is an engineering phase during which additional technical information and data will be collected, identified and incorporated into technical drawings and specifications developed for the subsequent remedial action. The EPA will be seeking a new coalition of PRPs to perform the remedial design activities. Remediation activities are not expected to commence for a number of years and responsibility for implementing and funding the EPA\u2019s selected remedy will be determined in a separate allocation process. While an allocation process is currently underway, the EPA's FS and its approach to the proposed alternative remedies have raised questions and uncertainty as to how that allocation process will proceed.\nBecause there has not been a determination of the total cost of the investigations, the remediation that will be required, the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the PRPs, the Company believes it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which it is likely to or which it is reasonably possible that it will incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nSignificant cash outflows in the future related to the Site could reduce the amount of our borrowing capacity that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. Any material liabilities incurred in the future related to the Site could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements. See \u201cContingencies - Environmental\u201d in Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe operate in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows\nDemand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and residential construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our operations tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. and foreign markets or any of the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we believe that drivers such as infrastructure growth in developing economies and demand for environmentally sustainable raw materials will continue to drive long-term global demand for recycled metal, we are unable to predict the duration of the current challenging economic and industry conditions that are contributing to a weaker demand environment for our products and constrained supply of raw materials.\nInstability in international markets may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the U.S. including countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region and North, Central and South America. Our ability to sell our products profitably to international markets is subject to a number of risks including the adverse impacts of political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events; local labor and social issues; legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; and disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies. The occurrence of such events and conditions may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\n14 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nChanges in the availability or price of raw materials and end-of-life vehicles could reduce our sales\nOur businesses require certain materials that are sourced from third-party suppliers. Although the synergies from our integrated operations allow us to be our own source for some raw materials, particularly with respect to scrap metal for SMB, we rely on other suppliers for most of our raw material needs. Industry supply conditions generally involve risks, including the possibility of shortages of raw materials, increases in raw material costs and reduced control over delivery schedules. We procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metal to us. In periods of declining or lower scrap metal prices, such as the declining price environment we experienced in fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities tightening supply. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling scrap metal to us, we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. A slowdown of industrial production in the U.S. may also reduce the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in less recyclable metal available to process and market. Increased competition for domestic scrap metal, including as a result of overcapacity in the scrap recycling industry in the U.S. and Canada, may also reduce the supply of scrap metal available to us. Failure to obtain a steady supply of scrap material could both adversely impact our ability to meet sales commitments and reduce our operating margins. Failure to obtain an adequate supply of end-of-life vehicles could adversely impact our ability to attract customers and charge admission fees and reduce our parts sales. Failure to obtain raw materials, such as alloys used in the steel-making process, could adversely impact our ability to make steel to the specifications of our customers.\nSignificant decreases in scrap metal prices may adversely impact our operating results\nThe timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which we operate are difficult to predict and are influenced by different economic conditions in the domestic market, where we typically acquire our raw materials, and foreign markets, where we typically sell the majority of our products. Purchase prices for scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles and selling prices for recycled scrap metal are volatile and beyond our control. In recent years, particularly fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, scrap metal prices experienced a significant downward trend caused primarily by the weak macroeconomic conditions and global steel-making overcapacity, which was further exacerbated by the impact of lower iron ore prices, a raw material used in steel-making in blast furnaces which compete with EAF steel-making production that uses ferrous scrap as its primary feedstock. While we attempt to respond to changing recycled scrap metal selling prices through adjustments to our metal purchase prices, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our metal purchase prices to fully offset a sharp reduction in recycled scrap metal sales prices, which may adversely impact our operating income and cash flows. For example, in fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, lower demand for recycled scrap metal relative to demand and competition for supply of unprocessed scrap metal in the domestic market compressed operating margins due to selling prices decreasing at a faster rate than purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal. In addition, a rapid decrease in selling prices may compress our operating margins due to the impact of average inventory cost accounting, which causes cost of goods sold recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to decrease at a slower rate than metal purchase prices and net selling prices.\nImbalances in supply and demand conditions in the global steel industry may reduce demand for our products\nEconomic expansions and contractions in global economies can result in supply and demand imbalances in the global steel industry that can significantly affect the price of commodities used and sold by our business, as well as the price of and demand for finished steel products. In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions. In recent years, overcapacity and excess steel production in these foreign countries resulted in the export of aggressively priced semi-finished and finished steel products. This led to disruptions in steel-making operations within other countries, negatively impacting demand for our recycled scrap metal products used by EAF mills globally as their primary feedstock. Further, the import of foreign steel products into the U.S. at similarly aggressive prices adversely impacted sales prices and sales volumes at SMB. Existing trade laws and regulations may be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although trade regulations restrict or impose duties on the importation of certain products, if foreign steel production significantly exceeds consumption in those countries, global demand for our recycled scrap metal products could decline and imports of steel products into the U.S. could increase, resulting in lower volumes and selling prices for AMR's recycled metal products and SMB\u2019s finished steel products.\n15 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nGoodwill impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet generated in connection with our acquisitions and business growth strategy. We test the goodwill balances allocated to our reporting units for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units may be below its carrying amount. A decline in the quoted market price of our stock could denote a triggering event indicating that goodwill may be impaired. When testing goodwill for impairment, we determine fair value using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d). Given that market prices of our reporting units are not readily available, we make various estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of the reporting units, including estimating revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants. We corroborate the reporting units\u2019 valuation using a market approach based on earnings multiple data and a reconciliation between our market capitalization and our estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units, including consideration of a control premium. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in the estimates and assumptions described above.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management identified the combination of a significant further weakening in market conditions, continued constrained supply of raw materials due to the lower price environment which negatively impacted volumes, the planned idling or closure of certain production facilities and retail stores, our recent financial performance and a decline in our market capitalization during the first half of fiscal 2015 as a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill allocated to our reporting units. The impairment test resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $141 million representing the entire carrying amount of the former MRB reporting unit's goodwill as of the measurement date of February 1, 2015.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified the combination of sustained weak market conditions, including the adverse effects of lower commodity selling prices and the constraining impact of the lower price environment on the supply of raw materials which negatively impacted volumes, our recent financial performance and a decline in our market capitalization as a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill allocated to our reporting units. The impairment test resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $9 million at a reporting unit within the AMR operating segment. For the other reporting unit with $166 million of goodwill as of February 1, 2016, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 27% and, therefore, no goodwill impairment was identified.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2016. As of the testing date, the balance of our goodwill of $167 million was carried by a single reporting unit within the AMR operating segment. We elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances led to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As a result of the qualitative assessment, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value as of the testing date and, therefore, no further impairment testing was required.\nDeclines in market conditions from current levels, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for the reporting unit with allocated goodwill, a decline in our share price from current levels for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based WACC, among other factors, could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in further goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and joint venture investments may adversely affect our operating results\nLong-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. The results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions, the Company\u2019s financial performance trends, or an increase in interest rates, among other factors. If as a result of the impairment test we determine that the fair value of any of our long-lived assets is less than its carrying amount, we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We recorded impairment charges on long-lived tangible and intangible assets associated with certain regional metals recycling operations and used auto parts store locations in the amount of $8 million and $44 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. With respect to our investments in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, a loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized. Once we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We recorded an impairment charge of $2 million during fiscal 2016 related to an investment in a joint venture. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on long-lived asset and joint venture investment impairment charges.\n16 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nOur productivity improvement and restructuring initiatives may not achieve the expected benefits or cost reductions\nWe have undertaken a number of productivity improvements and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability and to achieve further integration and synergistic cost efficiencies in our operating platform. In fiscal 2015 and 2016, restructuring initiatives included idling underutilized assets and closing facilities to more closely align our business to market conditions, implementing productivity initiatives to increase production efficiency and material recovery, and further reducing our annual operating expenses through headcount reductions, reducing organizational layers, consolidating shared service functions, savings from procurement activities, streamlining of administrative and supporting services functions, and other non-headcount measures. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We have incurred restructuring charges and other exit-related activities in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016 as a result of these initiatives and expect to incur restructuring charges and other-exit-related activities associated with these initiatives through fiscal 2017. Failure to achieve or sustain the expected cost reductions and benefits related to these restructuring initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAcquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences\nWe may make acquisitions of complementary businesses to enable us to enhance our customer base and grow our revenues. Execution of any past or potential future acquisition involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulty integrating the acquired businesses\u2019 personnel and operations;\n\u2022\nPotential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in realizing anticipated cost savings, efficiencies and synergies;\n\u2022\nUnexpected costs;\n\u2022\nInaccurate assessment of or undisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022\nInability to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\nDifficulty in managing growth.\nIf we do not successfully execute on acquisitions and the acquired businesses do not perform as projected, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanging economic conditions may result in customers not fulfilling their contractual obligations\nWe enter into export ferrous sales contracts preceded by negotiations that include fixing price, quantity, shipping terms and other contractual terms. Upon finalization of these terms and satisfactory completion of other contractual contingencies, the customer typically opens a letter of credit to satisfy its payment obligation under the contract prior to our shipment of the cargo. Although not considered normal course of business, in times of changing economic conditions, including during periods of sharply falling scrap metal prices such as those experienced in fiscal 2015, there is an increased risk that customers may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations or open letters of credit. For example, in fiscal 2015, the resale or modification of the terms, each at significantly lower prices, of certain previously contracted bulk shipments had a $7 million negative impact on our operating results. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, 34% and 28%, respectively, of our trade accounts receivable balance were covered by letters of credit.\nFurther increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may reduce the demand for our products\nA significant portion of AMR\u2019s revenues is generated from sales to foreign customers, which are denominated in U.S. dollars, including customers located in Asia, Africa and Europe. A strengthening U.S. dollar, as experienced in fiscal 2015 and continuing into fiscal 2016, makes our products more expensive for non-U.S. customers, which may negatively impact export sales. A strengthening U.S. dollar also makes imported metal products less expensive, which may result in an increase in imports of steel products into the U.S. As a result, our finished steel products, which are made in the U.S., may become more expensive for our U.S. customers relative to imported steel products thereby reducing demand for our products.\nWe are exposed to translation and transaction risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Hedging instruments may not be effective in mitigating such risks and may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains\nOur operations in Canada expose us to translation and transaction risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks due to exchange rate movements in connection with the translation of the operating costs and the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations into our functional currency for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n17 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency exchange transaction risk. As part of our risk management program, we may use financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange forward contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, these instruments may not be effective in reducing all risks related to such fluctuations and may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. Although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation, and our management believes all such instruments are entered into as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these instruments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Should our counterparties to such instruments or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from the transactions covered by these instruments.\nPotential limitations on our ability to access capital resources may restrict our ability to operate\nOur operations are capital intensive. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. While we expect that our cash requirements, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, and share repurchases, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our secured committed bank credit facility, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources.\nAlthough we believe we have adequate access to contractually committed borrowings, we could be adversely affected if our banks were unable to honor their contractual commitments or ceased lending. Failure to access our credit facilities could restrict our ability to fund operations, make capital expenditures or execute acquisitions.\nThe agreement governing our bank credit facility imposes certain restrictions on our business and contains financial covenants\nOur secured bank credit facilities contain certain restrictions on our business which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Our bank credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial and other covenants, including a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio, and a consolidated asset coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or financial covenants could result in an event of default under the bank credit agreement, and permit our lenders to cease lending to us and declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This could require us to refinance our bank facilities, which we may not be able to do at terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nConsolidation in the steel industry may reduce demand for our products\nThere has been a significant amount of consolidation in the steel industry in recent years that has included steel mills acquiring steel fabricators to ensure demand for their products. If any of SMB\u2019s significant remaining customers were to be acquired by competing steel mills, this could reduce the demand for our products and force us to lower our prices, reducing our revenues, or to reduce production, which could increase our unit costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to realize expected benefits from investments in processing and manufacturing technology may impact our operating results and cash flows\nWe make significant investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements aimed at increasing the efficiency and capabilities of our businesses and to maximize our economies of scale. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits and generate adequate returns on such capital improvement projects may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nReliance on third party shipping companies may restrict our ability to ship our products\nAMR and SMB generally rely on third parties to handle and transport raw materials to their production facilities and products to customers. Despite our practice of utilizing a diversified group of suppliers of transportation, factors beyond our control, including changes in fuel prices, political events, governmental regulation of transportation, changes in market rates, carrier availability, carrier bankruptcy, shipping industry consolidation and disruptions in transportation infrastructure, may adversely impact our ability to ship our products. These impacts could include delays or other disruptions in shipments in transit or third party shipping companies increasing their charges for transportation services or otherwise reducing or eliminating the availability of their vehicles or ships. As a result, we may not be able to transport our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may harm our reputation.\n18 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nEquipment upgrades, equipment failures and facility damage may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns\nOur recycling and manufacturing processes depend on critical pieces of equipment, including shredders, nonferrous sorting technology, furnaces and a rolling mill, which may be out of service occasionally for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures. Our facilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, earthquakes, accidents or violent weather conditions. We have insurance to cover certain of the risks associated with equipment damage and resulting business interruption, but there are certain events that would not be covered by insurance and there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms. Interruptions in our processing and production capabilities and shutdowns resulting from unanticipated events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProduct liability claims may adversely impact our operating results\nWe could inadvertently acquire radioactive scrap metal that could potentially be included in mixed scrap metal shipped to consumers worldwide. Although we have invested in radiation detection equipment in the majority of our locations, including the facilities from which we ship directly to customers, failure to detect radioactive scrap metal remains a possibility. Even though we maintain insurance to address the risk of this failure in detection, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage would be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, if we fail to meet contractual requirements for a product, we may be subject to product warranty costs and claims. These costs and claims could both have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity\nWe spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various matters, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this report. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation in excess of insurance recoveries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change may adversely impact our facilities and our ongoing operations\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present, for example rising sea levels at our deep water port facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deep water ports, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the scrap metal through our mega-shredders and ship products to our customers. Periods of extended adverse weather conditions may inhibit the supply of scrap metal to AMR and SMB, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or cause us to fail to meet our sales commitments. In addition, sustained periods of increased temperature levels in the summer in areas where our auto store operations are located could result in reduced customer traffic, thus resulting in lower admissions and parts sales.\nWe may not realize our deferred tax assets in the future\nThe assessment of recoverability of our deferred tax assets is based on an evaluation of existing positive and negative evidence as to whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. If negative evidence outweighs positive evidence, a valuation allowance is required. Impairment of deferred tax assets may result from significant negative industry or economic trends, a decrease in earnings performance and projections of future taxable income, adverse changes in laws or regulations and a variety of other factors. Impairment of deferred tax assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could result in not realizing the deferred tax assets. In recent years, we have recorded significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, and our low annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 is primarily the result of our full valuation allowance position. Deferred tax assets generated in future periods may require further valuation allowances if it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nTax increases and changes in tax rules may adversely affect our financial results\nAs a company conducting business on a global basis with physical operations throughout North America, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state, local and foreign tax rules. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax rules. In many cases, such changes put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers.\n19 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nA cybersecurity incident may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and reputation\nWe face global cybersecurity risks and threats on a continual and ongoing basis. These risks and threats range from inadvertent release of sensitive information to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. Our operations involve use of multiple systems that process, store and transmit sensitive information about our customers, suppliers, employees, financial position, operating results and strategies. While we are not aware of any material cyber-attacks or breaches of our systems to date, we have and continue to implement measures to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems, compromise sensitive information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment\nEnvironmental regulations may cause us to incur significant compliance costs\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries relating to, among other matters:\n\u2022\nWaste disposal;\n\u2022\nAir emissions;\n\u2022\nWaste water and storm water management and treatment;\n\u2022\nSoil and groundwater contamination remediation;\n\u2022\nGlobal climate change;\n\u2022\nDischarge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials; and\n\u2022\nEmployee health and safety.\nWe are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. Violation of or failure to obtain permits or comply with these laws or regulations could result in our business being fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or becoming subject to litigation by private parties. Our operations use, handle and generate hazardous substances. In addition, previous operations by others at facilities that we currently or formerly owned, operated or otherwise used may have caused contamination from hazardous substances. As a result, we are exposed to possible claims under environmental laws and regulations, especially for the remediation of waterways and soil or groundwater contamination. These laws can impose liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances even if the owner or operator was neither aware of nor responsible for the release of the hazardous substances. We have, in the past, been found not to be in compliance with certain of these laws and regulations, and have incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with such violations. Future environmental compliance costs may increase because of new laws and regulations, changing interpretations and stricter enforcement of current regulations by regulatory authorities, uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, the future costs of pollution control technology and issues related to global climate change. Further, the level of activity by regulatory authorities and non-governmental organizations has increased in recent years. Environmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See the risk factor \u201cPotential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity\u201d in this Item 1A.\nGovernmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our licenses and permits, thus restricting our ability to operate\nWe conduct certain of our operations subject to licenses, permits and approvals from state and local governments. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities, including auto parts facilities. In addition, from time to time, both the U.S. and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which we operate. In some countries, governments can require us to apply for certificates or registration before allowing shipment of recycled metal to customers in those countries. There can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses and permits we currently hold. Failure to obtain these approvals could cause us to limit or discontinue operations in these locations or prevent us from developing or acquiring new facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n20 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016\nTable of Contents SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.\nCompliance with existing and new greenhouse gas emission regulations may adversely impact our operating results\nIncreased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with regulations concerning and limitations imposed on climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, offsets or credits that may be part of \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products. See \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further detail.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Employees\nReliance on employees subject to collective bargaining may restrict our ability to operate\nApproximately 23% of our full-time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, including substantially all of the manufacturing employees at our SMB steel manufacturing facility. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements of such agreements on acceptable terms. Any failure to reach an agreement with one or more of our unions may result in strikes, lockouts or other labor actions, including work slowdowns or stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe underfunded status of our multiemployer pension plans may cause us to increase our contributions to the plans\nAs discussed in Note 13 - Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we contribute to the Steelworkers Western Independent Shops Pension Plan (\u201cWISPP\u201d), a multiemployer plan benefiting union employees of SMB. Because we have no current intention of withdrawing from the WISPP, we have not recognized a withdrawal liability in our consolidated financial statements. However, if such a liability were triggered, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows. Our contributions to the WISPP could also increase as a result of a diminished contribution base due to the insolvency or withdrawal of other employers who currently contribute to it, the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability or other funding deficiencies, as we would need to fund the retirement obligations of these employers.\nIn 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) approved a seven-year extension of the period over which the WISPP may amortize unfunded liabilities, conditioned upon maintenance of certain minimum funding levels. In 2014, the WISPP obtained relief from the specified funding requirements from the IRS, which requires that the WISPP meet a minimum funded percentage on each valuation date and achieve a funded percentage of 100% as of October 1, 2029. Based on the actuarial valuation for the WISPP as of October 1, 2015, the funded percentage (based on the ratio of the market value of assets to the accumulated benefits liability (present value of accrued benefits) using the valuation method prescribed by the IRS) was 74.3%, which satisfies the minimum funded percentage requirements of the IRS.", "PERMNO": 79866, "SIC": 5093, "TIC": "SCHN"}
