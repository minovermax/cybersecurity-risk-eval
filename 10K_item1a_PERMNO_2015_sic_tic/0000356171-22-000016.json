Current and prospective investors should carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties before making investment decisions about our securities. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations,\u201d and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our liquidity.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and municipalities around the world have instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, physical distancing requirements, and similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease. Such orders or restrictions, or the perception that such orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in non-essential business closures, work-from-home policies, school closings, travel restrictions, and cancellation or postponement of events, among other effects that could negatively impact productivity and disrupt our operations and those of our customers. The impacts of the pandemic on our business continue to evolve, are unpredictable and may continue to adversely affect our business, operations, and financial performance. The pandemic and its effects have negatively impacted certain areas of consumer and business spending. Businesses nationwide and in the regions and communities in which we operate have laid off and furloughed significant numbers of employees, leading to record levels of unemployment. These conditions have significantly and adversely affected our customers, including many small and mid-sized businesses, particularly those in the gas station, retail, hotel, hospitality and food, beverage, and elective healthcare industries, among many others. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the pandemic, including the passage of the CARES Act and subsequent legislation, but there can be no assurance that such steps or others will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.\nAs a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic, our revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rate, and our future operating results may deteriorate.\nThe future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business, operations and future financial performance could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022increased loan deferrals, loan delinquencies and subsequent credit losses resulting from the weakened financial condition of our borrowers as a result of the outbreak and related governmental actions;\n\u2022the negative effect on earnings resulting from the Bank modifying loans and agreeing to loan payment deferrals due to the COVID-19 crisis;\n\u2022declines in the value of collateral securing loans we have made;\n\u2022court closures and temporary foreclosure and eviction protection laws, even when a customer is in breach of its obligations to us, are likely to restrict our ability to realize the value of collateral;\n\u2022disruption in the businesses of third parties upon who we rely, including outages at network providers and other service providers and suppliers;\n\u2022increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online and remote activity;\n\u2022decreased loan growth as a result of diminished demand or increased levels of prepayments;\n\u2022decreased interest and non-interest income;\n\u2022continued decreased demand for certain bank products and services;\n\u2022declines in the value of securities we own, credit ratings downgrades, deterioration in issuers\u2019 financial condition or a decline in the liquidity for debt securities;\n\u2022operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions;\n\u2022reduced workforce numbers or capacity which may be caused by, but not limited to, illness, quarantine, stay at home or other government mandates, or difficulties transitioning back to an in-office environment;\n\u2022continued high levels of unemployment in certain business sectors due to decreased operations or closures of businesses could have a negative impact on our customer\u2019s ability to repay their loans as well as a decrease in the customer deposit base as they use their savings to pay current expenses;\n\u2022laws related to benefits and the treatment of employees, for example, mandating coverage of certain COVID-19 related testing and treatment, mandating additional paid or unpaid leave or expanding workers compensation coverage;\n\u2022unresolved supply chain issues remaining for longer than anticipated and decreased consumer and business confidence and economic activity, leading to certain lower loan demand and an increased risk of loan delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures;\n\u2022volatile market prices of investment securities, including the valuation of our common stock;\n\u2022unavailability of key personnel or a significant number of our employees due to the effects and restrictions of a COVID-19 outbreak within our market area;\n\u2022the protracted COVID-19 pandemic could further negatively affect the carrying amount of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets and result in realized losses on our financial assets, which would adversely impact our results of operations and the ability of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions; and\n\u2022additional costs to remedy damages, losses or disruption caused by such events.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, and developing work from home and social distancing plans for our employees), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus outbreak continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the emergence of new variants, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the effectiveness of our business continuity and pandemic plans, and how quickly and to what extent historical economic and operating conditions can resume, if ever. The longer the public health crisis lasts, and the greater its severity, the greater the likely material adverse impact on the economy, our customers and our business and financial performance. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s economic impact that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe prolonged and broad-based shift to a remote working environment continues to create inherent productivity, connectivity, and oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, conduct marketing events, and generate new customers, among others. In addition, the changed environment under which we are operating could have an effect on our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner.\nTo the extent the pandemic continues to adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, loans, asset quality, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Form 10-K.\nOur participation in the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) could expose us to additional risks.\nFederal and state governments have enacted laws intending to stimulate the economy in light of the business and market disruptions related to COVID-19. Since March 2020, the federal government has enacted a number of economic stimulus packages, including the $2.0 trillion CARES Act, which, among other things, initiated the PPP. On April 16, 2020, the original $349.0 billion of funding under the PPP was exhausted, and on April 24, 2020, the Federal Government allocated an additional $310.0 billion to the program. Effective January 19, 2021 a new round of PPP loans became available pursuant to the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act, making an additional $284.5 billion available to qualified borrowers. Our Bank participated as a lender in each of the PPP rounds, which were designed to help small businesses maintain their workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and we believe a significant majority of these loans will be forgiven under the terms of the PPP program. However, there can be no assurance that the borrowers will use or have used the funds appropriately or will have satisfied the staffing or payment requirements to qualify for forgiveness in whole or in part. Any portion of the loan that is not forgiven must be repaid by the borrower. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, which may or may not be related to an ambiguity in the laws, rules or guidance regarding operation of the PPP, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if we have already been paid under the guaranty, seek recovery from us of any loss related to the deficiency.\nSeveral large banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures they used in processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached us regarding PPP loans. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Nature and Geographic Area of Our Business\nWe are exposed to risks in connection with the loans we make.\nAs a lender, we face a significant risk that we will sustain losses because borrowers, guarantors or related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the loans we make or acquire. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. We have underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies, including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses, that we believe appropriately address this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance and diversifying our respective loan portfolios. Such policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results of operations. We could sustain losses if we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers or fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike other financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses would reduce our earnings and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our allowance for credit losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the known risks in the current portfolio, composition and growth of the loan portfolio and actual and forecast economic factors. Determining an appropriate level of allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The actual amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, unemployment and gross domestic product that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates. Further impacting the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses is the implementation of a new accounting standard, \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d commonly referred to as the \u201cCurrent Expected Credit Losses\u201d standard, or \u201cCECL,\u201d which was effective on January 1, 2020. CECL changed the allowance methodology from an incurred loss concept to an expected loss concept, which is more dependent on future economic forecasts, assumptions and models than previous methodology, which could result in increases and add volatility to our allowance for credit losses and future provisions for loan losses. These forecasts, assumptions and models are inherently uncertain and are based upon our management\u2019s reasonable judgment in light of information currently available.\nIn addition to periodic reviews completed by independent third parties retained by the Bank, Federal and state bank regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for credit losses. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover these estimated future losses, we cannot assure you that we will not increase the allowance for credit losses further or that the allowance will be adequate to absorb credit losses we actually incur. Either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by business conditions in California.\nWe conduct most of our business in California. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results may be impacted by economic conditions in California. Deterioration in the economic conditions in California could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:\n\u2022problem assets and foreclosures may increase,\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline,\n\u2022low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease, and\n\u2022collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.\nIn view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in California, we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of any of these consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and other external events could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and our customer base are primarily located in California where natural and other disasters may occur. California is known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods, the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change. These types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies, our business and customers in these regions. Such events could also affect the stability of the Bank\u2019s deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to obtain adequate insurance or repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans and cause significant property damage, result in losses of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on our customers and in turn, on us. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios, and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant majority of the loans in our portfolio are secured by California real estate and a decline in real estate values could hurt our business.\nA downturn in real estate values in the markets which we conduct our business in California could hurt our business because most of our loans are secured by real estate. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies. Real estate values could also be affected by, among other things, earthquakes, drought and national disasters. As real estate prices decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans is reduced. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral could then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 92.6% of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate. Substantially all of our real estate collateral is located in California. So, if there is a significant adverse decline in real estate values in California, the collateral for our loans will provide less security. Any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs\nincurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. When applicable, we establish contingent liability reserves for this purpose based on future reasonable and estimable costs developed by qualified soil and chemical engineering consultants. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities or if our contingency reserve estimates are incorrect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer similar services, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete. We primarily compete in California for loans, deposits and customers with commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage firms and Internet-based marketplace lending platforms. In particular, our competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries that are not subject to bank regulatory restrictions may have larger lending limits which would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies, such as Internet-based marketplace lenders, financial technology (or \u201cfintech\u201d) companies that rely on technology to provide financial services, often without many of the regulatory and capital restrictions that we face. We also face competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened loan production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral that we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to meet regulatory or other internal requirements. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that access to such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of investors or counter-parties participating in the capital markets, may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and we would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. The inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt our businesses.\nThe economic environment and market conditions in which we operate continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including:\n\u2022inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded,\n\u2022the introduction of tariffs, sanctions and other protectionist trade policies, or\n\u2022the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the \u201cGSEs\u201d).\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:\n\u2022erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency,\n\u2022provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations,\n\u2022increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and\n\u2022result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries.\nThese factors could lead to:\n\u2022greater market volatility,\n\u2022large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries,\n\u2022the widening or narrowing of credit spreads,\n\u2022inflationary pressures,\n\u2022lower investment growth, and\n\u2022other market dislocations.\nAdditional areas of uncertainty include, among others, geopolitical tensions and conflicts, pandemics and electorate volatility.\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause us to suffer losses in our investment securities portfolio, reduce our liquidity and capital levels, hamper our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and customers, and weaken our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates\nHistorically low interest rates or an interest rate curve that lacks sufficient positive slope as duration extends may make it difficult for us to improve or maintain our current interest income spread and could result in reduced earnings and negatively impact our financial performance.\nLike other financial institutions, we are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and leases and investments, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Because of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates may not produce matching changes in interest income we earn on interest-earning assets and interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, in turn, our profitability.\nIn addition, loan and lease volume and quality and deposit volume and mix can be affected by market interest rates as can the businesses of our clients. Changes in levels of market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest spread, asset quality, origination volume, the value of our loans and investment securities and overall profitability.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of our management, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits. The Federal Reserve lowered the primary credit rate by 50 and 100 basis points on March 3 and March 15, 2020, respectively, for a total of 150 basis points to 0.25% to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the liquidity and stability of banking institutions as they serve the increased demand for credit. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, may negatively affect our ability to originate loans and leases, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately could affect our earnings. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.\nHistorically low rates for an extended period of time could result in reduced returns from our investment and loan portfolio. If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period and assuming longer-term interest rates fall further, we could experience further net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have an adverse effect on our net interest income and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect a long duration of reduced or flat interest rates to negatively impact our net interest income, margin, cost of borrowing and future profitability and continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results for at least through 2022. While interest rates remain low, the FRB is expected to begin raising interest rates during 2022. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on the Company\u2019s activities and financial results.\nElevated inflation and expectations for elevated future inflation can adversely impact economic growth, consumer and business confidence, and the Company\u2019s financial condition and results. In addition, elevated inflation may cause unexpected changes in monetary policies and actions which may adversely affect confidence, the economy, and the Company\u2019s financial condition and results.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nAlthough we were successful in generating new loans during 2021, the continuation of historically low long-term interest rate levels may cause additional refinancing of commercial real estate and 1-4 family residence loans, which may depress our loan volumes or cause rates on loans to decline. To supplement our organic loan growth, we from time-to-time will purchase loans from third parties that may have lower yields than those loans that we originate on our own.\nAdditionally, interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers with variable rate loans, which increases the potential for default and could result in a decrease in the demand for loans. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reversal of income previously recognized, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. At the same time, we continue to incur costs to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income. Furthermore, if short-term market rates rise, in order to retain existing deposit customers and attract new deposit customers we may need to increase rates we pay on deposit accounts.\nAccordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHigher inflation could have a negative impact on our financial results and operations.\nInflation can negatively impact the Company by increasing our labor costs, through higher wages and higher interest rates, which may negatively affect the market value of securities on our balance sheet, higher interest expenses on our deposits, especially CDs, and a higher cost of our borrowings. Additionally, higher inflation levels could lead to higher oil and gas prices, which may negatively impact the net operating income on the properties which we lend on and could impair a borrower's ability to repay their mortgage.\nRecent supply chain constraints have led to higher inflation, which if sustained could have a negative impact on the Company's asset values and on loan demand.\nLonger-lasting supply chain constraints in various products and labor markets could potentially exacerbate inflation and sustain it at elevated levels, even as growth slows. The risk of sustained high inflation would likely be accompanied by monetary policy tightening with potential negative effects on various elevated asset classes.\nReduction in the value, or impairment of our investment securities, can impact our earnings and common shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe maintained a balance of $2.4 billion, or approximately 27.9% of our assets, in investment securities at December 31, 2021. Changes in market interest rates can affect the value of these investment securities, with increasing interest rates generally resulting in a reduction of value. Although the reduction in value from temporary increases in market rates does not affect our income until the security is sold, it does result in an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income that can reduce our common stockholders\u2019 equity. Further, we must periodically test our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment in value. In assessing whether the impairment of investment securities is other-than-temporary, we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term.\nChanges to LIBOR or SOFR may adversely affect the value of, and the return on, our financial instruments that are indexed to LIBOR or SOFR.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. In November 2020, the LIBOR administrator published a consultation regarding its intention to delay the date on which it will cease publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023 for the most common tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, including the three-month LIBOR, but indicated no new contracts using U.S. dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 2021. Publication of non-U.S. dollar LIBOR would continue to cease after December 31, 2021. Notwithstanding the publication of this consultation, there is no assurance of how long LIBOR of any currency or tenor will continue to be published. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published before June 30, 2023, or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Although the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has announced Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, SOFR may not gain market acceptance or be widely used as a benchmark. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the elimination or replacement of LIBOR, or other reforms may adversely affect the value of, and the return on our financial instruments.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of the Company\u2019s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities;\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the Company\u2019s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation, or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations. Any additional regulations are expected to increase our cost of operations. Furthermore, regulations may prevent or impair our ability to pay dividends, engage in acquisitions or operate in other ways.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the DPFI, FDIC, and the FRB. See Item 1 - Regulation and Supervision of this report for information on the regulation and supervision which governs our activities. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Banking regulations, designed primarily for the protection of depositors, may limit our growth and the return to our shareholders by restricting certain of our activities, such as:\n\u2022the payment of dividends to our shareholders,\n\u2022possible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other institutions,\n\u2022desired investments,\n\u2022loans and interest rates on loans,\n\u2022interest rates paid on deposits,\n\u2022service charges on deposit account transactions,\n\u2022the possible expansion or reduction of branch offices, and\n\u2022the ability to provide new products or services.\nWe also are subject to regulatory capital requirements. We could be subject to regulatory enforcement actions if any of our regulators determines for example, that we have violated a law of regulation, engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practice or lack adequate capital. Federal and state governments and regulators could pass legislation and adopt policies responsive to current credit conditions that would have an adverse effect on us and our financial performance. We cannot predict what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our operations, including the cost to conduct business.\nRisks Related to Our Growth and Expansion\nGoodwill resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets have increased substantially as a result of our acquisitions of FNB Bancorp in 2018 and North Valley Bancorp in 2014 and will increase again if we complete the acquisition of VRB. Potential impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment annually and more frequently when required by U.S. GAAP. We are required to record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their fair values. Our assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets could indicate that an impairment of the carrying value of such assets may have occurred that could result in a material, non-cash write-down of such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future earnings.\nPotential acquisitions create risks and may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe intend to continue to explore opportunities for growth through mergers and acquisitions. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022incurring substantial expenses in pursuing potential acquisitions without completing such acquisitions,\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company,\n\u2022losing key clients as a result of the change of ownership,\n\u2022the acquired business not performing in accordance with our expectations,\n\u2022difficulties and expenses arising in connection with the integration of the operations or systems conversion of the acquired business with our operations,\n\u2022difficulty in estimating the value of the target company,\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company,\n\u2022management needing to divert attention from other aspects of our business,\n\u2022potentially losing key employees of the acquired business,\n\u2022incurring unanticipated costs which could reduce our earnings per share,\n\u2022assuming potential liabilities of the acquired company as a result of the acquisition,\n\u2022potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company,\n\u2022potential disruption to our business, and\n\u2022an acquisition may dilute our earnings per share, in both the short and long term, or it may reduce our tangible capital ratios\nAcquisitions may be delayed, impeded, or prohibited due to regulatory issues.\nAcquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies (collectively, \u201cregulatory approvals\u201d). The process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult since the global financial crisis and more recently due to political actions. Furthermore, our ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions depends on the bank regulators' views at the time as to our capital levels, quality of management, and overall condition, in addition to their assessment of a variety of other factors, including our compliance with laws and regulations. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have, or may have, with regulatory agencies, including, without limitation, issues related to BSA compliance, CRA compliance, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices regulations and other laws and regulations. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot attract deposits, our growth may be inhibited.\nWe plan to increase the level of our assets, including our loan portfolio. Our ability to increase our assets depends in large part on our ability to attract additional deposits at favorable rates. We intend to seek additional deposits by offering deposit products that are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our markets and by establishing personal relationships with our customers. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to attract additional deposits at competitive rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur growth and expansion may strain our ability to manage our operations and our financial resources.\nOur financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy. In addition to seeking deposit and loan and lease growth in our existing markets, we may pursue expansion opportunities in new markets, enter into new lines of business or market areas or offer new products or services. Continued growth, however, may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any new line of business or market areas and/or new products or services could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced.\nOur growth may place a strain on our administrative, operational and financial resources and increase demands on our systems and controls. This business growth may require continued enhancements to and expansion of our operating and financial systems and controls and may strain or significantly challenge them. In addition, our existing operating and financial control systems and infrastructure may not be adequate to maintain and effectively monitor future growth. Our continued growth may also increase our need for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, integrating and retaining such personnel.\nWe will become subject to increased regulation when we have more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets.\nAn insured depository institution with $10 billion or more in total assets is subject to supervision, examination, and enforcement with respect to consumer protection laws by the CFPB rather than its primary federal banking regulator. Under its current policies, the CFPB will assert jurisdiction in the first quarter after an insured depository institution\u2019s call reports show total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more for four consecutive quarters. We expect that the Bank\u2019s total consolidated assets will exceeded this amount when we complete our acquisition of VRB and Valley Republic Bank, so the CFPB, instead of the FDIC, may soon have primary examination and enforcement authority over the Bank. As an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve Board focused solely on consumer financial protection, the CFPB may impose requirements more strictly or severely than the FDIC.\nAdditionally, other regulatory requirements apply to insured depository institution holding companies and insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including a cap on interchange transaction fees for debit cards, as required by Federal Reserve regulations, which would reduce our interchange revenue, and restrictions on proprietary trading and investment and sponsorship in hedge funds and private equity funds known as the Volcker Rule. See also Item 1 - Regulation and Supervision - Interchange Fees in this report. Further, deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated differently, and may be higher, for insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is limited by California law and the policies and regulations of the FRB. The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the FRB\u2019s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions.\u201d\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the Bank, our ability to continue to pay dividends depends in large part upon the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to us is subject to the restrictions in the California Financial Code.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our shareholder and the ability of the Bank to pay in dividends to us are by the requirements that the we and the Bank maintain a certain minimum amount of capital to be considered a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution as well as a separate capital conservation buffer, as further described under \u201cItem 1 - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Requirements\u201d in this report.\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or the Bank from declaring or paying dividends. Our holding company expenses and obligations with respect to our trust preferred securities and corresponding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by us may limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends.\nAnti-takeover provisions and federal law may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nVarious provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions provide for, among other things, specified actions that the Board of Directors shall or may take when an offer to merge, an offer to acquire all assets or a tender offer is received and the authority to issue preferred stock by action of the board of directors acting alone, without obtaining shareholder approval.\nThe BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either FRB approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the FRB and not disapproved prior to any person or entity acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of a bank holding company such as TriCo. These provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to shareholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nThe amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, our officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose.\nAs of December 31, 2021, directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 4.6% of our common stock and our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d) owned approximately 3.6%. Agreements with our senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock beneficially owned by our board of directors, management, and the ESOP, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals of us that our directors and officers oppose.\nHolders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders.\nWe have supported our growth through the prior issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures with face value of $62,889,000. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures we issued to the trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before we can pay any dividends on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, or to fund future growth, our board of directors may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of our common stock. The sale of these shares may significantly dilute your ownership interest as a shareholder. New investors in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders which may adversely impact our current shareholders.\nDifficult or changes in market conditions could adversely affect the financial services industry.\nThe financial markets have experienced volatility over the past several years. In some cases, the financial markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain companies without regard to those companies\u2019 underlying financial strength. If financial market volatility worsens, or there are disruptions in these financial markets, including disruptions to the United States banking systems, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect on our ability to access capital and our business, financial condition and result of operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. The Company\u2019s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022 recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022 new reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry or California economy;\n\u2022 perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or its competitors;\n\u2022 new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022 significant acquisitions or business combinations involving the Company or its competitors; and\n\u2022 changes in government regulations, including tax laws.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operational results.\nRisks Relating to Operations, Technology Systems, Accounting and Internal Controls\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal and disclosure controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We continually review and analyze our internal control over financial reporting for Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. As part of that process we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control as defined under standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that require remediation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for the oversight of the Company\u2019s financial reporting.\nAs a result of weaknesses that may be identified in our internal controls, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we discover weaknesses, we will make efforts to improve our internal and disclosure controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect our ability to remain listed with Nasdaq. Ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nA failure or breach, including cyberattacks, of our operational or security systems, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that our security measures will provide absolute security. Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. In fact, many other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, ransomware, cyberattacks, and other means. Certain financial institutions in the United States have also experienced attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to customers for extended periods. These \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks have not breached our data security systems, but require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We have implemented employee and customer awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our electronic payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nIf our security systems were penetrated or circumvented, it could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage our computers or systems and those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur reliance on third-party vendors exposes us to risks, including additional cybersecurity risks.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, including certain data processing and information services. On our behalf, third-parties may transmit confidential, propriety information. Although we require third-party providers to maintain certain levels of information security,\nsuch providers may remain vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information. While we may contractually limit our liability in connection with attacks against third-party providers, we remain exposed to the risk of loss associated with such vendors.\nIn addition, a number of our vendors are large national entities with dominant market presence in their respective fields. Their services could prove difficult to replace in a timely manner if a failure or other service interruption were to occur. Failures of certain vendors to provide contracted services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur significant expense.\nOur business is highly reliant on technology and our ability and our third-party service providers to manage the operational risks associated with technology.\nOur business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and business customer data. We depend on internal systems, third party service providers, cloud services and outsourced technology to support these data storage and processing operations. Despite our efforts to ensure the security and integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or those of third-party service providers or to implement effective preventive measures against all cybersecurity breaches. Cyberattack techniques change regularly and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments, and such third parties may seek to gain access to systems directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile, digital and other internet-based product offerings and expands our internal usage of web-based products and applications. A cybersecurity breach or cyberattack could persist for a long time before being detected and could result in theft of sensitive data or disruption of our transaction processing systems.\nOur inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. A material breach of customer data security may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers, result in increased expense to contain the event and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers, result in regulatory fines and sanctions and/or result in litigation. Cybersecurity risk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect us from all risks associated with maintaining the security of customer data and our proprietary data from external and internal intrusions, disaster recovery and failures in the controls used by our vendors.\nCybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.\nAs cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including TriCo and its bank subsidiary, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data. For more information regarding cybersecurity regulation, refer to the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of this report.\nWe receive, maintain and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled. For example, the CCPA, as amended, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds, including TriCo. For more information regarding data privacy regulation, refer to the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of this report.\nWe may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results. In addition, any additional laws will result in increased compliance costs.\nA failure to implement technological advances could negatively impact our business.\nThe banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers. In addition, advances in technology such as digital, mobile, telephone, text, and online banking; e-commerce; and self-service automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences to access our products and services through digital channels, could decrease the value of our branch network and other assets. We may close or sell certain branches and restructure or reduce our remaining branches and work force. These actions could lead to losses on assets, expense to reconfigure branches and loss of customers in certain markets. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe can be negatively affected if we fail to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.\nWhen we launch a new product or service, introduce a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity and cloud computing), or make changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses or result in:\n\u2022potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers\n\u2022increased operating expenses\n\u2022higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions\n\u2022damage to our reputation\n\u2022impairment of our liquidity\n\u2022regulatory intervention, or\n\u2022weaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nTriCo\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to us.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in our risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:\n\u2022hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to TriCo\u2019s senior management and the Board of Directors\n\u2022lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for us\n\u2022require significant resources and time to remediate\n\u2022lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022attract heightened regulatory scrutiny\n\u2022expose us to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings\n\u2022subject us to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022harm our reputation, or\n\u2022otherwise diminish confidence in TriCo.\nWe rely on data to assess many of our various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of our data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe depend on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nOur future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our executive officers and key personnel. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in many activities engaged in by us is intense including with respect to compensation and emerging workplace practices, accommodations and remote work options, and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them. In addition, the transition to increased work-from-home arrangements, which is likely to survive the COVID-19 pandemic for many companies, may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. Our current or future approach to in-office and work-from-home arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur previous results may not be indicative of our future results.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth and level of profitability or may not even be able to grow our business or continue to be profitable at all. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence and financial performance. If we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to a high percentage of our operating costs being fixed expenses.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional risks and expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new SEC regulations, have created additional expense for publicly traded companies such as the Company. The application of these laws, regulations and standards may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding management\u2019s required assessment of its internal control over financial reporting and our external auditors\u2019 audit of our internal control over financial reporting requires, and will continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Further, the members of our board of directors, members of our audit or compensation and management succession committees, our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer and certain other executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. It may also become more difficult and more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, our ability to attract and retain executive officers and qualified board and committee members could be more difficult.\nTax regulations could be subject to potential legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations.\nFederal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified and/or modified by legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time. Given the current economic and political environment, and ongoing budgetary pressures, the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation or new interpretations of existing tax laws could occur. The enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn the normal course of business, we are routinely subjected to examinations and audits from federal, state, and local taxing authorities regarding tax positions taken by us and the determination of the amount of tax due. These examinations may relate to income, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property, sales and use, or other tax returns. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the amount of taxes due, and may result in the imposition of penalties and interest. If any such challenges are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\nAs a community financial institution, we are at times subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including labor and employment, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves for possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.\nClimate change could have a material negative impact on the Company and clients.\nThe Company\u2019s business, as well as the operations and activities of our clients, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to the Company and its clients, and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate change presents multi-faceted risks, including: operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on the Company and its clients\u2019 facilities and other assets; credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy; and reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change, the Company\u2019s carbon footprint, and the Company\u2019s business relationships with clients who operate in carbon-intensive industries.\nFederal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities, investors, and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive environment, the Company may face regulatory risk of\nincreasing focus on the Company\u2019s resilience to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, and reputational risks and costs.\nWith the increased importance and focus on climate change, we are making efforts to enhance our governance of climate change-related risks and integrate climate considerations into our risk governance framework. Nonetheless, the risks associated with climate change are rapidly changing and evolving in an escalating fashion, making them difficult to assess due to limited data and other uncertainties. We could experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation, and technology and market changes, and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to our response to climate change and our climate change strategy, which, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 79116, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TCBK"}
