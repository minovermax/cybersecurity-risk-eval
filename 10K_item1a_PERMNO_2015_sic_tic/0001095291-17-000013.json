{"cik": "1095291", "company": "WEB.COM GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn evaluating Web.com and our business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties set forth below, together with all of the other information in this report. The following risks should be read in conjunction with our \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and fluctuations in our performance may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nDue to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our evolving industry our operating results are difficult to predict. We expect to experience fluctuations in our operating and financial results due to a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of attracting new customers;\n\u2022\nthe renewal rates and renewal terms for our services;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new services and products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train and retain members of our sales force;\n\u2022\nthe rate of expansion and effectiveness of our sales force;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nadditional investment in our services or operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully identify acquisition targets and integrate acquired businesses and technologies; and\n\u2022\nour success in maintaining and adding strategic marketing relationships.\nThese factors and others all tend to make the timing and amount of our revenue unpredictable and may lead to greater period-to-period fluctuations in revenue than we have experienced historically.\nAdditionally, in light of current global and U.S. economic conditions, we believe that our quarterly revenue and results of operations are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. The results of one quarter may not be relied on as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly revenue, profitability, operating metrics, or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nWe may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies or technologies, which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders, consume resources that may be necessary to sustain our business and increase debt for funding acquisitions.\nOne of our business strategies is to acquire complementary services, technologies or businesses. In connection with one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business; and\n\u2022\nincur debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay.\nBusiness acquisitions also involve the risk of unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, including securing the services of key employees. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could seriously harm our business.\nThe failure to integrate successfully the businesses of Web.com and an acquired company, if any, in the future within the expected timeframe would adversely affect the combined company's future results.\nOne of our business strategies is to acquire complementary services, technologies or businesses. The success of any future acquisition, including our acquisition of Yodle and DonWeb, will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits, including annual net operating synergies, from combining the businesses of Web.com and the acquired company. To realize these anticipated benefits, the combined company must successfully integrate the businesses of Web.com and an acquired company. This integration will be complex and time consuming.\nThe failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company's failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nlost sales and customers as a result of customers of either of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, combined business;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality services and products;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with our expansion into new international markets and doing business internationally;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the acquisition and integrating the companies' operations;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nin certain instances, the ability to exert control over acquired businesses that include earn out provisions in the agreements relating to such acquisitions or the potential obligation to fund an earn out for, or other obligations related to, a business that has not met expectations;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, information security vulnerabilities, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nSuccessful integration of Web.com's and an acquired company's operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on the combined company's management and internal resources. Challenges of integration include the combined company's ability to incorporate acquired products and business technology into its existing product offerings, and its ability to sell the acquired products through Web.com's existing or acquired sales channels. Web.com may also experience difficulty in effectively integrating the different cultures and practices of the acquired company, as well as in assimilating its' broad and geographically dispersed personnel. Further, the difficulties of integrating the acquired company could disrupt the combined company's ongoing business, distract its management focus from other opportunities and challenges, and increase the combined company's expenses and working capital requirements. The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm the combined company's business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on the reliability, security, and performance of our internally developed systems and operations, and any difficulties in maintaining these systems may result in service interruptions, decreased customer service, or increased expenditures.\nThe software and workflow processes that underlie our ability to deliver our web services and products have been developed primarily by our own employees. The reliability and continuous availability of these internal systems are critical to our business, and any interruptions that result in our inability to timely deliver our web services or products, or that materially impact the efficiency or cost with which we provide these web services and products, would harm our reputation, profitability, and ability to conduct business. In addition, many of the software systems we currently use will need to be enhanced over time or replaced with equivalent commercial products, either of which could entail considerable effort and expense. If we fail to develop and execute reliable policies, procedures, and tools to operate our infrastructure, we could face a substantial decrease in workflow efficiency and increased costs, as well as a decline in our revenue.\nSystem and Internet failures could harm our reputation, cause our customers to request reimbursement for services paid for and not received or cause our customers to seek another provider for services.\nWe must be able to operate the systems that manage our network around the clock without interruption. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our network infrastructure, equipment, and customer files against damage from human error, fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. Our networks are currently subject to various points of failure. For example, a problem with one of our routers (devices that move information from one computer network to another) or switches could cause an interruption in the services that we\nprovide to some or all of our customers. In the past, we have experienced periodic interruptions in service. We have also experienced, and in the future, we may again experience, delays or interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of Internet users, current and former employees, or others. Any future interruptions could:\n\u2022\ncause customers or end users to seek damages for losses incurred;\n\u2022\nrequire us to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities;\n\u2022\ndamage our reputation for reliable service;\n\u2022\ncause existing customers to cancel their contracts; or\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to attract new customers.\nWe have been adversely affected by information security breaches and cyber security attacks and could be adversely affected by breaches or attacks in the future.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Our web services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and employees' proprietary information. Our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct its operations. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of criminal cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of Web.com or third parties with whom we deal, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. It is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although we employ appropriate security technologies (including data encryption processes, intrusion detection systems), and conduct comprehensive risk assessments and other internal control procedures to assure the security of our customers' data, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient for this purpose.\nIn 2015, we were subject to an unauthorized breach of one of our computer systems. If our security measures are breached again as a result of third-party action, employee error or otherwise, and as a result our customers' or endusers' data becomes available to unauthorized parties, we could incur liability and our reputation would be damaged, which could lead to the loss of current and potential customers. If we experience any breaches of our network security or sabotage, we might be required to expend significant capital and other resources to detect, remedy, protect against or alleviate these and related problems, and we may not be able to remedy these problems in a timely manner, or at all. Because techniques used by outsiders to obtain unauthorized network access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Although we have insurance in place that covers such incidents, the cost of a breach or cyberattack could well exceed any such insurance coverage.\nOur servers are also frequently subjected to denial of service attacks and other attempts to disrupt traffic to ours and our customers' websites. Although we have been able to minimize these disruptions in the past, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully in the future. Our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails to misappropriate personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our users' computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by us, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information through email or download malware. Despite our efforts to mitigate \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails through product improvements and user education, \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d activities remain a serious problem that may damage our brands, discourage use of our websites and services and increase our costs.\nWe could become involved in claims, lawsuits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe may become a target of government investigations, private claims, or lawsuits, involving but not limited to general business, patent, or employee matters, including consumer class actions challenging our business practices. Such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Adverse outcomes could result in significant monetary damages, including indemnification payments, or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Given the inherent uncertainties in litigation, even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies, the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach. In addition, such investigations, claims and lawsuits could involve significant expense or divert management's attention and resources from other matters.\nIf we cannot adapt to technological advances, our web services and products may become obsolete and our ability to compete would be impaired.\nChanges in our industry occur very rapidly, including changes in the way the Internet operates or is used by small businesses and their customers. As a result, our web services and products could become obsolete quickly. The introduction of competing products employing new technologies and the evolution of new industry standards could render our existing products or services obsolete and unmarketable. To be successful, our web services and products must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. If we are unable to develop new web services or products, or enhancements to our web services or products, on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our new web services or products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be seriously harmed.\nMobile devices are increasingly being used to access the Internet, and our cloud-based and mobile support products may not operate or be as effective when accessed through these devices, which could harm our business.\nWe offer our products across several operating systems and through the Internet. Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are increasingly being used as the primary means for accessing the Internet and conducting e-commerce. We are dependent on the functionality of our products with third-party mobile devices and mobile operating systems, as well as web browsers that we do not control. Any changes in such devices, systems or web browsers that impact the functionality of our products or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect usage of our products. In addition, because a growing number of our customers access our products through mobile devices, we are dependent on the interoperability of our products with mobile devices and operating systems. Improving mobile functionality is integral to our long-term product development and growth strategy. In the event that our customers or endusers have difficulty accessing and using our products on mobile devices, our customer growth, business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to build and maintain brand awareness could compromise our ability to compete and to grow our business.\nAs a result of the highly competitive nature of our market, and the likelihood that we will face competition from new entrants, we believe our own brand name recognition and reputation are important. If we do not continue to build and maintain brand awareness, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to companies whose brands are more recognizable than ours.\nProviding web services and products to small businesses designed to allow them to Internet-enable their businesses is a fragmented and changing market; if this market fails to grow, we will not be able to grow our business.\nOur success depends on a significant number of small businesses outsourcing website design, hosting, and management as well as adopting other online business solutions. The market for our web services and products is relatively fragmented and constantly changing. Custom website development has been the predominant method of Internet enablement, and small businesses may be slow to adopt our template-based web services and products. Further, if small businesses determine that having an online presence is not giving their businesses any advantages, they would be less likely to purchase our web services and products. If the market for our web services and products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if our web services and products fail to achieve widespread customer acceptance, our business would be seriously harmed.\nA portion of our web services are sold on a month-to-month basis, and if our customers are unable or choose not to subscribe to our web services, our revenue may decrease.\nA portion of our web service offerings are sold pursuant to month-to-month subscription agreements and our customers generally can cancel their subscriptions to our web services at any time with little or no penalty.\nThere are a variety of factors, which have in the past led, and may in the future lead, to a decline in our subscription renewal rates. These factors include the cessation of our customers' businesses, the overall economic environment in the United States and its impact on small businesses, the services and prices offered by us and our competitors, and the evolving use of the Internet by small businesses. If our renewal rates are low or decline for any reason, or if customers demand renewal terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decrease, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe were profitable for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, but we were not profitable for the year ended December 31, 2014 and we may not be profitable in the future.\nWe were profitable for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, but we were not profitable for the year ended December 31, 2014 , and may not be profitable in future years. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $276.6 million. We expect that our expenses relating to the sale and marketing of our web services, technology\nimprovements and general and administrative functions, as well as the costs of operating and maintaining our technology infrastructure, will remain consistent as a percentage of revenue. Accordingly, we may need to maintain or increase our revenue levels to be able to continue to maintain profitability. We may not be able to reduce in a timely manner or maintain our expenses in response to any decrease in our revenue, and our failure to do so would adversely affect our operating results and our level of profitability.\nIf Internet usage does not grow or if the Internet does not continue to be the standard for eCommerce, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends upon the continued development and acceptance of the Internet as a widely used medium for eCommerce and communication. Rapid growth in the uses of, and interest in, the Internet is a relatively recent phenomenon and its continued growth cannot be assured. A number of factors could prevent continued growth, development and acceptance, including:\n\u2022\nthe unwillingness of companies and consumers to shift their purchasing from traditional vendors to online vendors;\n\u2022\nthe Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it, and its performance and reliability may decline as usage grows;\n\u2022\nsecurity and authentication issues may create concerns with respect to the transmission over the Internet of confidential information; and\n\u2022\nprivacy concerns, including those related to the ability of websites to gather user information without the user's knowledge or consent, may impact consumers' willingness to interact online.\nAny of these issues could slow the growth of the Internet, which could limit our growth and revenues.\nCharges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\nOne of our business strategies is to acquire complementary services, technologies or businesses and we have a history of such acquisitions. Under applicable accounting, we allocate the total purchase price of a particular acquisition to an acquired company's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition, and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Our management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain. Going forward, the following factors, among others, could result in material charges that would adversely affect our financial results:\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets;\n\u2022\ncharges for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets and for stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\naccrual of newly identified pre-merger contingent liabilities that are identified subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation; and\n\u2022\ncharges to eliminate certain of our pre-merger activities that duplicate those of the acquired company or to reduce our cost structure.\nAdditional costs may include costs of employee redeployment, relocation and retention, including salary increases or bonuses, accelerated amortization of deferred equity compensation and severance payments, reorganization or closure of facilities, taxes and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services. Some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made.\nIn the future, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $382.7 million of aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan and $49.3 million of Revolving Credit Facility (defined in Note 4, Long-Term Debt) and $258.8 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due August 15, 2018 (\"2018 Notes\") outstanding. We entered into an Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of February 11, 2016, which became effective on March 9, 2016, of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to which certain of our lenders have provided an additional $200.0 million of senior secured term loans, the proceeds of which, together with $115.0 million of revolving loans and cash on hand, was used to fund the acquisition of Yodle, Inc. Our ability to generate cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our debt will depend on our future performance, including the operations of Yodle upon the consummation of that transaction, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, including our ability to successfully integrate the operations of Yodle into our operations. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may need to seek additional capital to make these payments or undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets or reducing or delaying capital investments and acquisitions. We cannot assure you that\nsuch additional capital or alternative financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain additional capital or alternative financing on acceptable terms could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also choose to use cash flow from operations to repurchase shares of our common stock which would otherwise be available to pay down long-term debt.\nWeakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions, which may remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Global financial developments, such as the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Monetary Union, may adversely impact the economy of the European Union, seemingly unrelated to us or our industry may harm us. The United States and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, poor credit, restricted liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our service, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, or affect renewal rates, all of which could harm our operating results.\nOur existing and target customers are small businesses. These businesses may be more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. For instance, a financial crisis affecting the banking system or financial markets or the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business would result in a tightening in the credit markets, which could limit our customers' access to credit. Additionally, these customers often have limited discretionary funds, which they may choose to spend on items other than our web services and products. If small businesses experience economic hardship, or if they behave more conservatively in light of the general economic environment, they may be unwilling or unable to expend resources to develop their online presences, which would negatively affect the overall demand for our services and products and could cause our revenue to decline.\nIf we fail to comply with the established rules of credit card associations, we will face the prospect of financial penalties and could lose our ability to accept credit card payments from customers, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nA substantial majority of our revenue originates from online credit card transactions. Under credit card association rules, penalties may be imposed at the discretion of the association. Any such potential penalties would be imposed on our credit card processor by the association. Under our contract with our processor, we are required to reimburse our processor for such penalties. We face the risk that one or more credit card associations may, at any time, assess penalties against us or terminate our ability to accept credit card payments from customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur data centers are maintained by third parties. A disruption in the ability of one of these service providers to provide service to us could cause a disruption in service to our customers.\nA substantial portion of the network services and computer servers we utilize in the provision of services to customers are housed in data centers owned by other service providers. In particular, a significant number of our servers are housed in data centers in Atlanta, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida and New York, New York. We obtain Internet connectivity for those servers, and for the customers who rely on those servers, in part through direct arrangements with network service providers and in part indirectly through the owners of those data centers. We also utilize other third-party data centers in other locations. In the future, we may house other servers and hardware items in facilities owned or operated by other service providers.\nA disruption in the ability of one of these service providers to provide service to us could cause a disruption in service to our customers. A service provider could be disrupted in its operations through a number of contingencies, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, and other extreme conditions. Although we believe we have taken adequate steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot eliminate the risk of a disruption in service resulting from the accidental or intentional disruption in service by a service provider. Any significant disruption could cause significant harm to us, including a significant loss of customers. In addition, a service provider could raise its prices or otherwise change its terms and conditions in a way that adversely affects our ability to support our customers or could result in a decrease in our financial performance.\nWe face intense and growing competition. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be seriously harmed.\nThe market for our web services and products is highly competitive and is characterized by relatively low barriers to entry. Our competitors vary in terms of their size and what services they offer. We encounter competition from a wide variety of company types, including:\n\u2022\nwebsite design and development service and software companies;\n\u2022\nInternet service providers and application service providers;\n\u2022\nInternet search engine providers;\n\u2022\nlocal business directory providers;\n\u2022\nwebsite domain name providers and hosting companies; and\n\u2022\neCommerce platform and service providers.\nIn addition, due to relatively low barriers to entry in our industry, we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future from both established and emerging companies. Increased competition may result in reduced gross margins, the loss of market share, or other changes which could seriously harm our business. We also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidations and formations of alliances among industry participants.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater brand recognition and, we believe, a larger installed base of customers. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services and products than we can. If we fail to compete successfully against current or future competitors, our revenue could increase less than anticipated or decline and our business could be harmed.\nWe might require additional capital to support our growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new services and products, enhance our existing web services, or our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.\nIn the event of another global financial crisis, such as the one experienced in 2008, which included, among other things, significant reductions in available capital from banks and other providers of credit and substantial reductions or fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide, may make it difficult for us to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.\nWe are subject to export control and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and reputational harm. U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws also prohibit certain transactions with U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to continue to provide value-added web services and products, many of which we provide through agreements with third parties. Our business will be harmed if we are unable to provide these web services and products in a cost-effective manner.\nA key element of our strategy is to combine a variety of functionalities in our web service offerings to provide our customers with comprehensive online solutions, such as Internet search optimization, local yellow pages listings, and eCommerce\ncapabilities. We provide many of these services through arrangements with third parties, and our continued ability to obtain and provide these services at a low cost is central to the success of our business. For example, we currently have agreements with several service providers that enable us to provide, at a low cost, Internet yellow pages advertising. However, these agreements may be terminated on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, without penalty. If any of these third parties were to terminate their relationships with us, or to modify the economic terms of these arrangements, we could lose our ability to provide these services at a cost-effective price to our customers, which could cause our revenue to decline or our costs to increase.\nThe Company's ability to use its net operating loss carry forwards (\"NOLs\") to offset future taxable income may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels, or as a result of a change in control which could limit available NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has U.S. Federal NOLs of approximately $213.5 million, which includes $72 million from Yodle pre-acquisition periods, available to offset future taxable income and expire between 2020 and 2035. These amounts currently exclude $77.0 million related to excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation tax deductions in excess of book compensation which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when such deductions reduce taxes payable, as determined on a \u201cwith-and-without\u201d basis. See Note 2 for additional information related to ASU 2016-09, which the Company will adopt in the first quarter of 2017.\nThese NOLs are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Accordingly, the Company estimates that at least $159.8 million of these NOLs will be available during the carry forward period based on our existing Section 382 limitations.\nIf the Company experiences any future \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code, the Company's ability to utilize its U.S. Federal NOLs could be further limited. Similar results could apply to our U.S. state NOLs because the states in which we operate generally follow Section 382.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company also had $51.5 million of NOLs in the United Kingdom (\"UK\") related to Scoot, of which the substantial portion was incurred in pre-acquisition periods. Although not subject to expiration, pre-acquisition NOLs could be eliminated under certain circumstances, as determined under applicable tax laws in the United Kingdom, in the 3 year periods both before and after the acquisition date. Although the Company does not believe the pre-acquisition NOLs are subject to any such limitations to date, future activities could subject these NOLs to limitation. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's valuation allowance includes $50.4 million of these NOLs as it is not more likely than not that this portion of the NOLs will be realized based on the expected reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities. The net tax values related to UK NOLs and related valuation allowance decreased as a result of changes in foreign exchange and tax rates during the year.\nThe Company's ability to use its NOLs will also depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The U.S. NOLs may expire before the Company can generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the NOLs.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2018 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 2018 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2018 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in-capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2018 Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 2018 Notes to their face amount over the term of the 2018 Notes. We will also report lower net income or increased net loss in our financial results, the trading price of our common, and the trading price of the 2018 Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the 2018 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares that would be issuable upon conversion of the 2018 Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent the conversion value of the 2018 Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit our use the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2018 Notes, then our diluted earnings per share may be adversely affected.\nAny growth could strain our resources and our business may suffer if we fail to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth.\nGrowth in our business may place a strain on our management, administrative, and sales and marketing infrastructure. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, our business could be disrupted, and our ability to operate our business profitably could suffer. Growth in our employee base may be required to expand our customer base and to continue to develop and enhance our web service and product offerings. To manage growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to enhance our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. This will require additional personnel and capital investments, which will increase our cost base. The growth in our fixed cost base may make it more difficult for us to reduce expenses in the short term to offset any shortfalls in revenue.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results, which could cause our stock price to fall or result in our stock being delisted.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports. We will need to devote significant resources and time to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Section 404 under Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we assess and our auditors attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our ability to comply with the annual internal control report requirement in future years will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our company and our operating subsidiaries. We expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex as we integrate acquisitions and our business grows. To effectively manage this complexity, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could adversely affect our business and jeopardize our listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, either of which would harm our stock price.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers, and the loss of any key personnel may compromise our ability to successfully manage our business and pursue our growth strategy.\nOur future performance depends largely on the continuing service of our executive officers and senior management team, especially that of David Brown, our Chief Executive Officer. Our executives are not contractually obligated to remain employed by us. Accordingly, any of our key employees could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty and may go to work for one or more of our competitors after the expiration of their non-compete period. The loss of one or more of our executive officers could make it more difficult for us to pursue our business goals and could seriously harm our business.\nOur growth will be adversely affected if we cannot continue to successfully retain, hire, train, and manage our key employees, particularly in the telesales and customer service areas.\nOur ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy will depend on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees across our business. We have many key employees throughout our organization that do not have non-compete agreements and may leave to work for a competitor at any time. In particular, we are substantially dependent on our telesales and customer service employees to obtain and service new customers. Competition for such personnel and others can be intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract, integrate, or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. In addition, our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue will depend, in large part, on our success in effectively training sufficient personnel in these two areas. New hires require significant training and in some cases may take several months before they achieve full productivity, if they ever do. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we have our facilities. If we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, or hiring, training and integrating new employees, or if our current or future employees perform poorly, growth in the sales of our services and products may not materialize and our business will suffer.\nIncreases in payment processing fees, changes to operating rules, the acceptance of new types of payment methods or payment fraud could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur customers pay for our services predominately using credit and debit cards (together, \"payment cards\"). Our acceptance of these payment cards requires our payment of certain fees. From time to time, these fees may increase, either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result of a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a cost-per-transaction basis. Such increases may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs our services continue to evolve and expand internationally, we will likely explore accepting various forms of payment, which may have higher fees and costs than our currently accepted payment methods. In addition, if more of our customers utilize higher cost payment methods, our payment costs could increase and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, we do not obtain signatures from customers in connection with their use of payment methods. To the extent we do not obtain customer signatures, we may be liable for fraudulent payment transactions, even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders.\nFrom time to time, fraudulent payment methods are used to obtain service. While we do have certain safeguards in place, we nonetheless experience some fraudulent transactions. The costs to us of these fraudulent transaction includes the costs of implementing as well as updating our safeguards. These fraudulent accounts also increase our bad debt expense and complicate our forecasting efforts as they result in almost 100% customer loss when they are discovered. We do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent payment transactions. A failure to adequately control fraudulent payment transactions may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be affected by new governmental regulations regarding the Internet.\nTo date, government regulations have not materially restricted the use of the Internet in most parts of the world. The legal and regulatory environment pertaining to the Internet, however, is uncertain and may change. New laws may be passed, existing but previously inapplicable or unenforced laws may be deemed to apply to the Internet or regulatory agencies may begin to rigorously enforce such formerly unenforced laws, or existing legal safe harbors may be narrowed, both by U.S. federal or state governments and by governments of foreign jurisdictions. These changes could affect:\n\u2022\nthe liability of online resellers for actions by customers, including fraud, illegal content, spam, phishing, libel and defamation, infringement of third-party intellectual property and other abusive conduct;\n\u2022\nother claims based on the nature and content of Internet materials;\n\u2022\nuser privacy and security issues;\n\u2022\nconsumer protection;\n\u2022\nsales taxes by the states in which we sell certain of our products and other taxes, including the value-added tax of the European Union member states, which could impact how we conduct our business by requiring us to set up processes to collect and remit such taxes and could increase our sales audit risk;\n\u2022\ncharacteristics and quality of services; and\n\u2022\ncross-border eCommerce.\nThe adoption of any new laws or regulations, or the application or interpretation of existing laws or regulations to the Internet, could hinder growth in use of the Internet and online services generally, and decrease acceptance of the Internet and online services as a means of communication, ecommerce and advertising. In addition, such changes in laws could increase our costs of doing business, subject our business to increased liability or prevent us from delivering our services over the Internet, thereby harming our business and results of operations.\nChanges in legislation or governmental regulations, policies or standards applicable to our product offerings may have a significant impact on our ability to compete in our target markets.\nThe telecommunications industry is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission ('FCC\") in the U.S. While most such regulations do not affect us directly, certain of those regulations may affect our product offerings. For example, effective October 16, 2013, FCC rules were adopted to require companies to obtain prior express written consent from consumers before calling them with prerecorded telemarketing \"robocalls\" or before using an autodialer to call their wireless numbers with telemarketing messages unless an unambiguous written consent is obtained before the telemarketing call or text message. If we are unable to satisfy such FCC rules, we could be prevented from providing such product offering to our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our future revenues.\nOur business could be materially harmed if the administration and operation of the Internet no longer rely upon the existing domain system.\nThe domain registration industry continues to develop and adapt to changing technology. This development may include changes in the administration or operation of the Internet, including the creation and institution of alternate systems for directing Internet traffic without the use of the existing domain system. The widespread acceptance of any alternative systems\ncould eliminate the need to register a domain to establish an online presence and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActivities of customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and brand or harm our business and financial results.\nAs a provider of domain name registration and hosting products and services, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers in connection with their use (including their misuse) of our offerings. Although our agreements with our customers prohibit unauthorized use of our products and services and permit us to take appropriate actions for such use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities, which could subject us to liability. Our reputation and brand may also be negatively impacted by the actions of customers. We do not proactively monitor or review the appropriateness of customers\u2019 use of our products or services, and we do not have control over customer activities. While we have safeguards in place, these mechanisms may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation and brand.\nCertain federal statutes may apply to us with respect to various activities of our customers, including: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\u201cDMCA\u201d); the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (\u201cCDA\u201d); and the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\u201cACPA\u201d). The DMCA and the CDA generally protect online service providers like us from liability for certain activities of their customers. For example, the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA shield Internet service providers and other intermediaries from direct or indirect liability for copyright infringement. Under the CDA, we are generally not responsible for the customer-created content hosted on our servers and thus are generally immunized from liability for torts committed by others. Under the safe harbor provisions of the ACPA, domain name registrars are shielded from liability in many circumstances.\nChanges to these laws and/or court rulings in pending or future litigation may narrow the scope of protection afforded us. Regardless of these protections, the activities of our customers may result in threatened or actual litigation against us. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately or cost-effectively, which may cause us to lose market share or otherwise harm our competitive position.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect and preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology, web services, and products. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market services and products similar to those offered by us, which could decrease demand for our web services and products. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our proprietary assets without our authorization. We do not currently rely on patents to protect all of our core intellectual property. To protect, control access to, and limit distribution of our intellectual property, we generally enter into confidentiality and proprietary inventions agreements with our employees, and confidentiality or license agreements with consultants, third-party developers, and customers. We also rely on copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection. However, these measures afford only limited protection and may be inadequate. Enforcing our rights to our technology could be costly, time-consuming and distracting. Additionally, others may develop non-infringing technologies that are similar or superior to ours. Any significant failure or inability to adequately protect our proprietary assets will harm our business and reduce our ability to compete.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws or under Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3% of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder and which may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets would result in a decrease in earnings.\nCurrent accounting rules require that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives may not be amortized, but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually. These rules also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We have substantial goodwill and other intangible assets, and we would be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. Any impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nSubstantial changes to tax policies and other regulations may affect our business.\nSubstantial change to tax policies and other regulations, which could include comprehensive tax reform, may have an impact on our business. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we will benefit from, or will be negatively affected by, the changes.", "PERMNO": 90984, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "WEB"}
