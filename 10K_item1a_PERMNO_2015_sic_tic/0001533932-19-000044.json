{"cik": "1533932", "company": "Worldpay, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we cannot keep pace with rapid developments, changes and consolidation occurring in our industry and successfully provide new services to our clients, the use of our services could decline, reducing our revenues.\nThe electronic payments market in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological change, new product and service introductions, including ecommerce services, mobile payment applications, and products, evolving industry standards, changing customer and consumer needs, the entrance of non-traditional competitors and periods of increased consolidation. In order to remain competitive in this rapidly evolving market, we are continually involved in a number of projects to develop new and innovative services (including our ongoing efforts to onboard new merchant customers and migrate existing merchant customers to our new proprietary global acquiring platform). These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of market acceptance of new or innovated services. Any complication, interruption or delay encountered in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services or to accurately predict and address market demand could render our services less desirable, or even obsolete, to our clients.\nIn addition, the new or innovative services we develop are designed to process very complex transactions and provide information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. Any failure to deliver reliable, effective and secure services that meet the expectations of our clients could result in increased costs and/or a loss in business and revenues that could reduce our earnings. If we are unable to develop, adapt to or access technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nThe payment processing industry is highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect the transaction and other fees we receive from merchants and financial institutions, and as a result, our margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors include financial institutions and well-established payment processing companies, including Adyen, Bank of America Merchant Services, Barclays plc, Chase Paymentech Solutions, Elavon Inc. (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), First Data Corporation, Global Payments, Inc., and Total System Services, Inc. in our Merchant Solutions segment, and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., First Data Corporation, Fiserv, Inc., Total System Services, Inc. and Visa Debit Processing Service in our Issuer Solutions segment. With respect to our Issuer Solutions segment, in addition to competition with direct competitors, we also compete with the capabilities of many larger potential clients to conduct their key payment processing applications in-house.\nIn addition, our U.S. competitors that are financial institutions or are affiliated with financial institutions may not incur the sponsorship costs we incur for registration with the payment networks. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective clients or other services that we do not provide. Competition could result in a loss of existing clients, and greater difficulty attracting new clients. Furthermore, if competition causes us to reduce the fees we charge in order to attract or retain clients, there is no assurance we can successfully control our costs in order to maintain our profit margins. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are facing new competitive pressure from non-traditional payments processors and other parties entering the payments industry, such as PayPal, Google, Apple, Alibaba, Amazon, Square and Stripe, who may compete in one or more of the functions performed in processing merchant transactions. These companies have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. If these companies gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions or if we are unable to successfully react to changes in the industry spurred by the entry of these new market participants, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of data, whether through cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or otherwise, could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nWe have responsibility for certain third parties, including merchants, referral partners, third party service providers and other agents, which we refer to collectively as associated participants, under Visa, Mastercard and other payment network rules and regulations. We and certain of our associated participants process, store and/or transmit sensitive data, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, credit or debit card numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers and bank account numbers, and we have ultimate liability to the payment networks and member financial institutions that register us with Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks for our failure or the failure of our associated participants to protect this data in accordance with payment network requirements. The loss of merchant or cardholder data by us or our associated participants could result in significant fines and sanctions by the payment networks or governmental bodies. A significant cybersecurity breach could also result in payment networks prohibiting us from processing transactions on their networks or the loss of our financial institution sponsorship that facilitates our participation in the payment networks, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the Internet. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect. We and our associated participants have been in the past and could be in the future, subject to breaches of security by hackers. In such circumstances, our encryption of data and other protective measures have not prevented and may not prevent unauthorized access service disruption or system sabotage. Although we have not incurred material losses or liabilities as a result of security breaches we or our associated participants have experienced, any future breach of our system or an associated participant could be material and harm our reputation, deter clients and potential clients from using our services, increase our operating expenses, expose us to uninsured losses or other liabilities, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, result in material penalties and fines under state and federal laws or by the payment networks, and adversely affect our continued payment network registration and financial institution sponsorship.\nWe cannot assure you that our arrangements with associated participants will prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data or that we would be reimbursed by associated participants in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of data. Any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data could result in protracted and costly litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur systems and our third party providers\u2019 systems may fail or become obsolete due to changes implemented to keep pace with technological advances, our inability to keep pace with such technological advances or factors beyond our control, which could interrupt our service, cause us to lose business and increase our costs.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of numerous systems, including our computer systems, software, data centers and telecommunications networks, as well as the systems of third parties, in order to provide services to our clients. Our systems and operations and those of our third party providers, could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, our efforts to onboard and migrate merchant customers to our new proprietary global acquiring platform, telecommunications failures, unauthorized entry, security breach, computer viruses, defects and development delays, fire, natural disaster or power loss. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. Defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors, interruptions or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties could result in loss of revenues and clients, reputational harm, additional operating expenses in order to remediate the failures, fines imposed by payment networks and exposure to other losses or other liabilities.\nWe could be subject to certain risks associated with the implementation of our new proprietary global acquiring platform.\nWe are making significant progress toward implementation, of our proprietary global acquiring platform project. As we continue to implement this project, through the migration of existing merchant customers and onboarding of new merchant customers to the platform, the scale and complexity associated with this project presents the increased potential for service level delays or disruptions in the processing of transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties. Such delays or disruptions could result in reputational harm, loss of business and increased operational or technological costs.\nWe may not be able to continue to expand our share of the existing payment processing markets or expand into new markets which would inhibit our ability to grow and increase our profitability.\nOur future growth and profitability depend upon the growth of the markets in which we currently operate and our ability to increase our penetration and service offerings within these markets, as well as the emergence of new markets for our services and our ability to penetrate these new markets. It is difficult to attract new clients because of potential disadvantages associated with switching payment processing vendors, such as transition costs, business disruption and loss of accustomed functionality. We seek to overcome these factors by making investments to enhance the functionality of our platforms and differentiate our services. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful, and this resistance may adversely affect our growth.\nOur expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to adapt our existing technology and offerings or to develop new or innovative applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market. In order to do so, we will need to anticipate and react to market changes and devote appropriate financial and technical resources to our development efforts, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.\nFurthermore, in response to market developments, we may continue to expand into new geographical markets and foreign countries in which we do not currently have any operating experience. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully continue such expansion efforts due to our lack of experience and the multitude of risks associated with global operations or lack of appropriate regulatory approval.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s proposed withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe June 2016 referendum voting for the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) (\u201cBrexit\u201d) has resulted in significant political uncertainty in both the U.K. and the E.U. The impact of Brexit and the resulting effect on the political and economic future of the U.K. and the E.U. remain uncertain following the rejection by the U.K. Parliament in January 2019 of the terms of a draft Withdrawal Agreement, negotiated and agreed between the U.K. government and the E.U. in November 2018. If the U.K. does not retain access to E.U. markets at the time Brexit takes effect (currently set for March 29, 2019), on a transitional basis or permanently, our business may be adversely affected. Brexit may result in a significant change in the regulatory environment in the U.K. and the E.U, including potentially divergent national laws and regulations, which may likely increase our compliance and operational costs. Brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, global stock market and currency exchange rate volatility, causing a decline in the value of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar. We may find it more difficult to conduct business in the U.K. and the E.U., as Brexit may result in increased restrictions on the movement of capital, goods, services and personnel. Depending on the ultimate terms of the U.K.\u2019s proposed withdrawal from the E.U., we may decide to relocate or otherwise alter our European operations to respond to the new business, legal, regulatory, tax and trade environments that may result.\nAs with any political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business, developments related to Brexit may materially and adversely affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees and could harm our business, business opportunities, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and operating synergies expected from our acquisition of Worldpay Group plc, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe success of our acquisition of Worldpay Group plc depends, in significant part, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business, grow our revenue and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies. Achieving our strategic goals for the acquisition requires growth of the revenue and realization of the targeted operating synergies expected from the acquisition. This growth and the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than we expect. Actual operating, technological, strategic and revenue opportunities, if achieved at all, may be less significant than we expect or may take longer to achieve than anticipated and could be impacted by our inability to renew certain business relationships maintained by Worldpay Group plc on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition within a reasonable time, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur acquisition of Worldpay Group plc has resulted in significant integration costs and any material delays or unanticipated additional expenses may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe complexity and magnitude of the integration effort associated with our acquisition of Worldpay Group plc are significant and require that we fund significant capital and operating expenses to support the integration of the combined operations. Such expenses have included significant transaction, consulting and third party service fees. We incurred integration planning costs during 2017 and 2018 and anticipate that we may incur additional integration implementation costs in the future. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional operating expenses while we continue to integrate the combined company. The integration of the departments, systems, business units, operating procedures and information technologies of the two businesses continue to present certain challenges to management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to integrate and manage these operations effectively or that such operations, once fully-integrated, will provide us with the benefits we anticipate.\nIn addition to transition costs, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses. Any material delays, difficulties or unanticipated additional expenses associated with integration activities, or the failure to successfully integrate the business in a timely manner, or at all, may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny future acquisitions and partnerships that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nAcquisitions and partnerships are part of our growth strategy. We evaluate, and expect in the future to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of, and partnerships with, complementary businesses, services or technologies. However, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition and partnership candidates in the future. In addition, bank regulators may assert that an acquisition or other corporate initiative is inconsistent with applicable banking laws and regulations or is subject to limitations or approval requirements. Such limitations or approval requirements could limit our ability to acquire other businesses or enter into other strategic transactions.\nIf we do enter into acquisitions and partnerships, they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipate. We may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, services or technologies that we acquire or with which we form a partnership, or comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may divert management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Certain partnerships we make may also prevent us from competing for certain clients or in certain lines of business. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. To the extent we pay the purchase price with proceeds from the incurrence of debt, it would increase our already high level of indebtedness and could negatively affect our liquidity and restrict our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the Visa, Mastercard or other payment networks, those payment networks could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors or directly. Fines could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and if these registrations are terminated, we may not be able to conduct our business.\nIn order to provide our transaction processing services in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, we are registered through our bank sponsorships with the Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks as service providers for member institutions. We and many of our clients are subject to payment network rules. If we or our associated participants do not comply with the payment network requirements, the payment networks could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations. We have occasionally received notices of noncompliance and fines, which have typically related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures on the part of a merchant. If we are unable to recover fines from or pass through costs to our merchants or other associated participants, we would experience a financial loss. The termination of our registration, or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop providing payment network services to the Visa, Mastercard or other payment networks, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOutside of the U.S., we primarily provide acquiring and processing services directly, through international credit and debit card schemes run by Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks. In order to access the card schemes\u2019 networks we must maintain the relevant jurisdictional operating licenses or memberships. In some markets where it is not feasible or possible for us to have a direct acquiring license with a card scheme, we have a relationship with a local financial institution sponsor. As part of our registration with card schemes (either directly or indirectly through local sponsors), we are subject to operating rules, including mandatory technology requirements, promulgated by the card schemes that could subject us and our customers to a variety of fines and penalties, as well as suspension and termination of membership or access. Furthermore, to access these card scheme networks, we must pay card scheme membership fees, which are subject to change from time to time,\nand which we may be unable to pass along to its customers, which could result in us absorbing a portion or all of such increases in the future.\nChanges in the rules or standards of payment networks and card schemes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPayment network and card scheme rules are established and changed from time to time by each payment network or card scheme, as applicable, as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. In the case of card scheme rules, failure to comply in a timely manner with rule changes could result in fines, penalties or reputational damage, and could negatively impact our licenses in various jurisdictions. In some cases, payment networks and card schemes compete with us, and their ability to modify and enhance their rules in their sole discretion may provide them an advantage in selling or developing their own services that may compete directly or indirectly with our services. Any changes in the rules or standards of these payment networks and card schemes, or the way they are implemented, could increase our cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to or through our clients and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, as payment networks and card schemes become more dependent on proprietary technology, modify their technological approach or operating practices, and/or seek to provide value added services to issuers and merchants, there is heightened risk that rules and standards may be governed by their own self-interest, or the self-interest of third parties with influence over them, which could materially impact Worldpay\u2019s competitive position and operations.\nIf we cannot pass along to our merchants increases in interchange and other fees from payment networks or card schemes, our operating margins would be reduced.\nWe pay interchange, assessment, transaction and other fees set by the payment networks and card schemes to such networks and schemes and, in some cases, to the card issuing financial institutions for each transaction we process. From time to time, the payment networks and card schemes increase the interchange fees and other fees that they charge payment processors and the financial institution sponsors. At their sole discretion, our financial institution sponsors have the right to pass any increases in interchange and other fees on to us and they have consistently done so in the past. We are generally permitted under the contracts into which we enter, and in the past we have been able to, pass these fee increases along to our merchants through corresponding increases in our processing fees. However, if we are unable to pass through these and other fees in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, in order to access the card schemes directly, as we do primarily outside the U.S., we must pay card scheme membership fees, which are subject to change from time to time, and which we may be unable to pass along to our merchants, potentially resulting in us absorbing a portion or all of such increases in the future.\nIf our agreements with U.S. financial institution sponsors and clearing service providers to process electronic payment transactions are terminated or otherwise expire and we are unable to renew existing or secure new sponsors or clearing service providers, we will not be able to conduct our business in the United States.\nIn the United States and certain other markets, the Visa, Mastercard and other payment network rules require us to be sponsored by a member bank in order to process electronic payment transactions. Because we are not a U.S. bank, we are unable to directly access these payment networks in the U.S. We are currently registered with the Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks through Fifth Third Bank in the U.S. and other sponsor banks elsewhere. Our current agreement with Fifth Third Bank expires in December 2024. These agreements with Fifth Third Bank and other sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants. Our financial institution sponsors\u2019 discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also rely on Fifth Third Bank and various other financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. Without these sponsorships or clearing services agreements, we would not be able to process Visa, Mastercard and other payment network transactions or settle transactions in relevant markets, including the U.S. which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results could be adversely affected if our costs associated with such sponsorships or clearing services agreements increase.\nIncreased merchant, financial institution or referral partner attrition and decreased transaction volume could cause our revenues to decline.\nWe experience attrition and declines in merchant and financial institution credit, debit or prepaid card processing volume resulting from several factors, including business closures, consolidations, loss of accounts to competitors, account closures that we initiate due to heightened credit risks, and reductions in our merchants\u2019 sales volumes. Our referral partners, many of which are not exclusive, such as merchant banks, technology solution partners, payment facilitators, independent sales organizations and trade associations are contributors to our revenue growth in our Merchant Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. If a referral partner switches to another transaction processor, shuts down or becomes insolvent, we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the referral partner, and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the referral partner. We cannot predict the level of attrition and decreased transaction volume in the future and our revenues could decline as a result of higher than expected attrition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business is international in nature, we are subject to various geopolitical, regulatory, tax and business risks, including movement in foreign exchange rates.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Operating in foreign countries, including in the U.K. and the European Union countries, subjects us to multiple risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, nationalism and terrorism, social unrest or human rights issues;\n\u2022\npartial or total expropriation of international assets;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, including tariffs or import-export restrictions;\n\u2022\nenforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u2022\ndifferent, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws; and\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws or policies.\nViolations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our colleagues; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, violations by our colleagues, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business and reputation. In addition, we may in the future undertake projects and make investments in countries in which we have little or no previous investment or operating experience. We may not be able to fully or accurately assess the risks of investing in such countries, or may be unfamiliar with the laws and regulations in such countries governing its investments and operations. As a result, we may be unable to effectively implement its strategy in new jurisdictions. Investment opportunities in certain jurisdictions may be also restricted by legal limits on foreign investment in local assets or classes of assets.\nEconomic and political uncertainty in the U.S. and globally could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nAs a result of the international nature of our business, we are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions not only in the U.S., but also globally. Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political conditions, including the potential for additional government shutdowns, on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could result in reductions in sales of our products and services and could cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulation, supervision, and enforcement authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which includes banking regulators and the CFPB in the United States, the FCA and PSR in the United Kingdom, and the Dutch Central Bank.\nBecause we are a technology service provider to U.S. Financial Institutions, we are subject to regular oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (\u201cFFIEC\u201d), which is an inter-agency body of federal\nbanking regulators. The FFIEC have broad discretion in the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of banking and consumer protection laws. Our failure to comply with these laws, or our failure to meet the supervisory expectations of the banking regulators, could result in adverse action against us. The regulators have the power to, among other things, enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices; require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice; issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced; direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets; and assess civil money penalties.\nBanking regulators could assert that our relationship with Fifth Third Bank entitles such regulators to impose limitations, conditions or approval requirements affecting our activities, investments or acquisitions. The imposition of such limitations, conditions or approval requirements could have an adverse impact on our business, such as by preventing us from pursuing an otherwise attractive acquisition or business opportunity. We have agreed with Fifth Third Bank to a framework for addressing any such limitations, conditions or approval requirements. See the section above entitled \u201cBanking Regulation\u201d for a more detailed discussion of such framework.\nWe are also subject to on-going supervision by regulatory and governmental bodies across the world, including economic and conduct regulators such as the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) in the United Kingdom and the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank or DNB) in the Netherlands, and regulatory and governmental bodies responsible for issuing anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, and global economic sanctions regulations. These various regulatory regimes require us to be in compliance across many aspects of our activities in respect of capital requirements, safeguarding, training, authorization and supervision of personnel, systems, processes and documentation. If we fail to comply with relevant regulations or applicable economic sanctions, we risk reputational damage, potential civil and criminal sanctions, fines or other action imposed by regulatory or governmental authorities, including the potential suspension or revocation of the permission-based regulatory licenses which authorize us to provide core services to customers. Certain aspects of our business may be determined by an appropriate regulator, quasi regulatory body or the courts as not being conducted in accordance with applicable laws or regulations, or we may face allegations of direct or indirect non-compliance with relevant regulatory regimes (such as the misselling of financial products), or other actions in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and other jurisdictions, as well as private litigation resulting from such actions. This could result in an adverse effect on our business, reputation and customer relationships, which in turn could adversely affect our financial position and performance.\nSpecifically, the PSR has announced it will carry out a market review into card-acquiring services provided by merchant acquirers in the U.K. with the scope of such review to include: the nature and characteristics of card-acquiring services; who provides card-acquiring services and how their market shares have developed historically; how merchants buy card-acquiring services; whether there are credible alternatives to card-acquiring services for some or all merchants; the outcomes of the competitive process including the fees merchants pay and the quality of service they receive. Because the PSR is an economic regulator in the U.K., it has the power to issue directions in relation to the functioning of the card acquiring market in the U.K. as a result of this review. Further, the European Commission is conducting a review of the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions (IFR) to examine the appropriateness of the levels of interchange fees (taking into account the use and cost of the various means of payments), the level of entry of new players, new technology and the impact of innovative business models on the market. The primary purpose of this review is to understand whether overall costs for card acceptance for merchants, including the overall merchant service charge, have gone up, down or broadly stayed the same since the introduction of the IFR. The E.U. has overall authority to enforce and establish new standards or guidance which may require banks and payments institutions, including us, to modify current pricing and fee structures, and the E.U. could choose to exercise such authority prior to or after conclusion of this review.\nFraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions initiated by merchants or other associated participants. Examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly accepts payment by a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card number or other credentials records a false sales transaction utilizing a stolen or counterfeit card or credentials, processes an invalid card, or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. In the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase our chargeback liability or other liability. In addition, beginning October 2015, U.S. merchants that cannot process EMV chip-based cards are held financially responsible for certain fraudulent transactions conducted using such cards. This will likely increase the amount of risk for merchants who are not yet EMV-compliant and could result in us having to seek increased chargebacks from such merchants. Increases in chargebacks or other liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in the use of credit, debit or prepaid cards as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the payment processing industry in general could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf consumers do not continue to use credit, debit or prepaid cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash, alternative currencies and technologies, credit, debit and prepaid cards, or the corresponding methodologies used for each, which is adverse to us, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general, such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for our clients to do business, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf Fifth Third Bank fails or is acquired by a third party, it could place certain of our material contracts at risk or decrease our revenue.\nFifth Third Bank accounted for less than 2% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 and is the provider of the services under our Clearing, Settlement and Sponsorship Agreement, Referral Agreement and Master Services Agreement. If Fifth Third Bank were to be placed into receivership or conservatorship, it could jeopardize our ability to generate revenue and conduct our business.\nIf Fifth Third Bank were to be acquired by a third party, it could affect certain of our contractual arrangements with them. For instance, in the event of a change of control or merger of Fifth Third Bank, our Clearing, Settlement and Sponsorship Agreement and our Referral Agreement provide that Fifth Third Bank may assign the contract to an affiliate or successor, in which case we would not have the right to terminate the contract regardless of such assignee\u2019s ability to perform such services. Our Master Services Agreement provides that Fifth Third Bank would be in default under the agreement upon a change of control, in which case we would have the right to terminate the agreement effective upon 60 days\u2019 notice to Fifth Third Bank unless the surviving entity assumes Fifth Third Bank\u2019s obligation and the level of fees paid to us pursuant to the Master Services Agreement remains equal or greater than fees paid to us prior to the change of control. In addition, the acquiring company may choose to terminate the terms of such contracts, requiring us to litigate if we believe such termination is not pursuant to contract terms, and find alternative clients, counterparties or sponsorships. The added expense of litigation and the inability to find suitable substitute clients or counterparties in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not have a historical relationship with the acquiring party, and the acquiring party may be a competitor of ours or provide many of the same services that we provide.\nOur risk management framework may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure against all types of risks.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report our risks. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies such that there could be risks that we cannot anticipate or identify. If our risk management framework were to become ineffective, we could experience unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our clients are subject to extensive government regulation. Violations, perceived weaknesses in compliance or internal controls, or changes in the regulatory regime or industry standards may have an unfavorable impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur business is impacted by numerous laws, regulations, regulatory guidance and examinations that affect us and our industry, many of which are discussed under \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation.\u201d The regulatory regime is evolving and subject to new or changing laws and regulations, as well as changes in the way exiting laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, significantly changed the U.S. payment processing industry by restricting amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing financial institutions can charge merchants and allowing merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and offer discounts for different payment methods. In addition, new regulations outside of the U.S., for example PSD2 or GDPR, and the implementation of compliance processes related to them, may also impose significant operational restrictions on us, increase our expenses and/or otherwise limit our ability to expand into new products or jurisdictions or otherwise execute our strategy. These and other regulatory changes on our business and industry could negatively affect our business in a variety of ways including the number of debit transactions, and prices charged per transaction.\nIn the future, due to applicable law and regulation, we may have to seek and obtain additional licenses in various jurisdictions. If we fail or are unable to comply with these requirements, our clients (or in certain instances, we) could be\nsubject to the imposition of fines, other penalties or enforcement-related actions which may impact our ability to offer our credit issuer processing services, prepaid or other related services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business is highly regulated, it is very important to our business that our operations, policies and procedures comply with applicable laws, regulations and related requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or our failure to adapt to changes in the regulatory regime, industry standards, or social expectations of corporate fairness, could increase our costs or result in enforcement, litigation, or other governmental action against us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nGovernmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to consumer information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services to merchants.\nGovernmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the transfer of, and requiring safeguarding of, non-public personal information. For example, in the United States, all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information. Although we have limited our use of consumer information solely to providing services to other businesses and financial institutions, we are required by regulations and contracts with our merchants and financial institution clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. These contracts require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines. The compliance standards relate to our infrastructure, components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer personal information shared by our clients with us. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future. If we fail to comply with these regulations or requirements, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings. In addition, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients.\nFurthermore, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, and which was implemented in the U.K. by the Data Protection Act 2018, requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and substantially increases the penalties for non-compliance. Our GDPR compliance efforts could cause us to incur significant expenses, and if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the U.S. federal or state level, or in other jurisdictions in which we operate, our compliance costs may increase, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulation, supervision, examination, and enforcement authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which includes banking regulators and the CFPB in the U.S., because we provide services to banks and other financial institutions.\nBecause we provide data processing and other services to U.S. banks, we are subject to regular oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (\u201cFFIEC\u201d), which is an inter-agency body of federal banking regulators. Because we are a service provider to insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more in connection with their consumer financial products and to entities that are larger participants in markets for consumer financial products and services such as prepaid cards, we are subject to regulation and enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d). Banking regulators could assert that our relationship with Fifth Third Bank entitles such regulators to impose limitations, conditions or approval requirements affecting our activities, investments or acquisitions. The imposition of such limitations, conditions or approval requirements could have an adverse impact on our business, such as by preventing us from pursuing an otherwise attractive acquisition or business opportunity. We have agreed with Fifth Third Bank to a framework for addressing any such limitations, conditions or approval requirements. See the section above entitled \u201cBanking Regulation\u201d for a more detailed discussion of such framework.\nThe U.S. banking regulators and CFPB have broad discretion in the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of banking and consumer protection laws. Our failure to comply with these laws, or our failure to meet the supervisory expectations of the banking regulators or CFPB, could result in adverse action against us. The regulators have the power to, among other things, enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices; require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice; issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced; direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets; and assess civil money penalties.\nWe are also subject to on-going supervision by regulatory and governmental bodies across the world, including economic and conduct regulators such as the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems Regulator in the United Kingdom and the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank) in the Netherlands, and regulatory and governmental bodies responsible for issuing money laundering and anti-bribery regulations and global economic sanctions. These various regulatory regimes require us to be in compliance across many aspects of our activities in respect of capital requirements, safeguarding, training, authorization and supervision of personnel, systems, processes and documentation. If we fail to comply with any relevant regulations or applicable economic sanctions, we risk reputational damage, potential civil and criminal sanctions, fines or other action imposed by regulatory or governmental authorities, including the potential suspension or revocation of the permission-based regulatory licenses which authorize us to provide core services to customers. Certain aspects of our business may be determined by an appropriate regulator, quasi regulatory body or the courts as not being conducted in accordance with applicable laws or regulations, or we may face allegations of direct or indirect non-compliance with relevant regulatory regimes (such as the mis-selling of financial products), or other actions in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and other jurisdictions, as well as private litigation resulting from such actions. This could result in an adverse effect on our business, reputation and customer relationships, which in turn could adversely affect our financial position and performance.\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretations, or becoming subject to additional international, U.S., state or local taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchants, could reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we do business and we have structured our business in accordance with such tax laws and interpretations of such tax laws as they exist today. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount of our cash flow, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, companies in the electronic payments industry, including us, may become subject to incremental taxation in various tax jurisdictions. Taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. If we are required to pay additional taxes and are unable to pass such taxes or expenses through to our merchants, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced.\nChanges to laws and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, even if not directed at us, may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers, adversely affecting our business. Even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our business or our reputation. Furthermore, we are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct business. Changes in such laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive, the value of tax losses and tax credit carry forwards recorded on our balance sheet and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.\nWe have a significant proportion of assets, liabilities and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound sterling and the Euro. As a result, a depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on our financial results and affect our reported results of operations and the value of its assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet in future periods.\nWe attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense, and we regularly review our program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary. Although these hedging arrangements are in place to mitigate foreign currency risk, such arrangements may prove ineffective in protecting us from any negative impacts of foreign exchange fluctuations and our financial condition and results of operation will therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates.\nFailure to comply with the laws and regulations of the United States as well as those of the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to conduct business in certain countries and may affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws regarding our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, regulations issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, import and export control laws, payment card industry data security standards, anti-trust and competition laws, securities regulations and regulations of various foreign governmental and regulatory agencies. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs\nor require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\nWhile we seek to actively monitor the regulatory status of our activities across all the jurisdictions in which we operate, there is a level of complexity that we face in terms of interpreting, complying with and tracking changes to licensing requirements meaning it is not always possible to determine whether our merchant acquiring and other payment processing activities are, or are treated by regulators as amounting to, regulated activity, and applicable laws and regulations are often vague as to whether or not they definitively cover such activities. Actual or alleged violations of any relevant laws or regulations could result in enforcement actions and financial penalties that could result in substantial costs and reputational damage and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.\nThe costs and effects of pending and future litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are involved in various litigation matters and from time to time may be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any securities litigation were to be instituted against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, it could result in substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our business, profitability and reputation.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nThird parties may challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not provide us any competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain service offerings or other competitive harm. Our competitors could also independently develop similar technology, duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property. We may be forced to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. Also, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from third parties on reasonable terms or at all. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain third party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services and technology infringe upon or otherwise violate a third party\u2019s proprietary rights, or if a third party claims we have breached their copyright, trademark, license usage or other intellectual property rights. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. Additionally, we could be required to defend against individuals and groups who have been purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to pay costly settlement or damage awards, or prevent us from marketing or selling certain of our services. If we cannot redesign affected services or license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFinally, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, which we use in connection with our technology and services. Despite our efforts to prevent it from occurring, we could be required to by some of our open source software licenses to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing payment processing industry and the selected markets in which we offer our services. The loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers, including Charles D. Drucker, our chief executive officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in order for us to successfully compete and grow, we must attract, recruit, retain and develop the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital needs. We have hired significant numbers of new personnel in recent years and must continue to hire additional personnel to execute our strategic plans. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income.\nWe have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically our revenues have been strongest in our fourth quarter, and weakest in our first quarter. This is due to the increase in the number and amount of electronic payment transactions related to seasonal retail events.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, which may prevent us from growing our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, including developing new services and technologies, and to fund ongoing operating expenses. We also may need additional financing earlier than we anticipate if we, among other things:\n\u2022\nare required to pay significant settlements or fines;\n\u2022\nrepurchase our common stock; or\n\u2022\nfinance Worldpay, Inc.\u2019s purchase of Class B units of Worldpay Holding from Fifth Third Bank upon the exercise of its right to put its Class B units of Worldpay Holding to Worldpay, Inc. in exchange for cash.\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities, these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding Class A common stock. We may also decide to issue securities, including debt securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our Class A common stock. Any debt financing would increase our already high level of indebtedness and could negatively affect our liquidity and restrict our operations. We may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all. If financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our future needs. This may prevent us from increasing our market share, capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry.\nWe have a long sales cycle for many of our services, and if we fail to close sales after expending significant time and resources to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe initial installation and set-up of many of our services often involve significant resource commitments by our clients, particularly those with larger operational scale. Potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available services and require us to expend substantial time (six to nine months is not uncommon), effort and money educating them as to the value of our services. We incur substantial costs in order to obtain each new customer. We may expend significant funds and management resources during a sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale. Our sales cycle may be extended due to our clients\u2019 budgetary constraints or for other reasons. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Organizational Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nWe have a high level of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of $7.8 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total payments under our annual debt service obligations, including interest and principal, were approximately $656.1 million. Our high degree of leverage could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including our borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to comply with the obligations of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, which could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to obtain payment network sponsorship and clearing services from financial institutions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nWe may not be able to refinance our senior secured credit facilities or any other indebtedness because of our high level of debt, debt incurrence restrictions under our debt agreements or because of adverse conditions in credit markets generally.\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we still may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness. Although our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, we may incur up to $1.25 billion of additional debt pursuant to an incremental facility under our senior secured credit facilities, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments may not be successful in managing our interest rate risks and could result in material financial losses by us.\nTo the extent that we hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates were to change in our favor. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations. In addition, a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation, thereby exposing us to credit risk. Further, we may have to repay certain costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate these arrangements. Finally, our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from management\u2019s expectations. As a result, we cannot assure that our interest rate hedging arrangements will effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 69% of our total assets at December 31, 2018. These assets consist primarily of goodwill and customer relationship intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. Additional acquisitions would also result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets. Under current accounting standards, we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset, while\ngoodwill is not amortized. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and certain intangible assets. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are party to tax receivable agreements and the amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements are expected to be significant. In certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreements may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreements.\nWe are party to tax receivable agreements (\u201cTRAs\u201d) as further described in \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As of December 31, 2018, we have a liability recorded of approximately $663.9 million associated with the TRAs. In addition, if Fifth Third Bank had exchanged its remaining Class B units of Worldpay Holding all for shares of Class A common stock on December 31, 2018, we would have recorded an additional full and undiscounted TRA obligation of approximately $200.0 million. This estimate is subject to material change based on changes in Fifth Third Bank\u2019s tax basis in the partnership interest, changes in tax rates, or significant changes in our stock price. It is possible that future transactions or events, including changes in tax rates, could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding TRA payments. There may be a material adverse effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, distributions to us by Worldpay Holding are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the TRAs.\nThe TRAs provide that, upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or certain other changes of control, our obligations to make payments with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully use the NOLs or deductions arising from increased tax basis of assets. As a result, upon a merger or other change of control, or upon certain circumstances specified in the agreement we entered into with Fifth Third in connection with our acquisition of Worldpay Group, plc, we could be required to make payments under the TRAs that are greater than 85% of our actual tax savings.\nWe may elect to terminate any or all of the remaining TRAs prior to the time they terminate in accordance with their terms, or enter into repurchase addendums providing for the early settlement of certain obligations. If we were to so elect, or if we materially breach a material obligation in the TRAs and we do not cure such breach within a specified time period, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits taken into account under the TRAs. In these circumstances, the anticipated future tax benefits would be determined under certain assumptions that in general assume that we would recognize the greatest amount of benefits at the earliest time. As a result, the payments we would be required to make could exceed 85% of the tax savings that we actually realize from the increased tax basis and/or the NOLs, and we could be required to make those payments significantly in advance of the time the tax savings arise.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, challenges the tax basis increases or NOLs that give rise to payments under the TRAs and the tax basis increases or NOLs are subsequently disallowed, our payments under the TRAs could exceed our actual tax savings, and we may not be able to recoup previous payments under the TRAs that were calculated on the assumption that the disallowed tax savings were available.\nWe are a holding company and our principal assets are our interests in Worldpay Holding, and we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from Worldpay Holding to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends, if any, and taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through Worldpay Holding and its subsidiaries. We have no material assets other than our ownership of units of Worldpay Holding. To the extent that we need funds and Worldpay Holding is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable law or regulation, or by the terms of Worldpay Holding\u2019s indebtedness, or Worldpay Holding is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and, consequently, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and the business that can be conducted at such\nmeeting;\n\u2022\nprohibition on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors elected by the holders of our Class A common stock without cause;\n\u2022\nour ability to issue additional shares of Class A common stock and to issue preferred stock with terms that the board of directors may determine, in each case without stockholder approval (other than as specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation);\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nsuper majority approval requirements for amending or repealing provisions in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on action by written consent of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company that is in the best interest of our stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to nominate directors for election to our board of directors and take other corporate actions.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Class A Common Stock or Depositary Interests\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock, securities convertible into or exchangeable for Class A common stock, or our Depositary Interests could depress the market price of our shares.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had 300,454,590 shares of Class A common stock outstanding. Subject to compliance with applicable documentation, which includes the Exchange Agreement, Fifth Third Bank could acquire up to 10,252,826 shares of our Class A common stock. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, Fifth Third Bank is entitled to certain demand and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights and any shares of our Class A common stock that are sold by Fifth Third Bank pursuant to such a registration would become eligible for sale in the public market without restriction. In addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 relating to an aggregate of 39,750,519 shares of our Class A common stock that we have issued or may issue in the future pursuant to employee benefit plans. These shares may be sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to the terms of the equity incentive plan and applicable award agreements.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock or Depositary Interests.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide accurate financial information. If we are unable to adequately maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all possible error and fraud. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nFurthermore, the additional scale of our operations since our acquisition of Worldpay Group plc, together with the complexity of the integration effort, may adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely basis as we continue to implement modifications to our internal control systems, processes and information systems. Due to this complexity, there can be no assurances that changes to our internal control over financial reporting will be effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, or are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market perception thereof may be materially adversely affected.\nThe price of our Class A common stock may be volatile.\nSecurities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock regardless of our results of operations. The trading price of our Class A common stock and the Depositary Interests is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including, among other things, the risk factors described in this section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other factors beyond our control.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Class A common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering, and we do not intend to in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering, and we do not intend to in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to repay indebtedness and to support our general corporate purposes. We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from Worldpay Holding. The amounts available to us to pay cash dividends are also restricted by our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, and, to the extent that we require additional funding, the sources of such additional funding may prohibit the payment of a dividend. As a result, appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock, if any, will be the only source of gain on an investment in our Class A common stock.\nHolders of Depositary Interests must rely on the Depositary or the Custodian to exercise rights attaching to our shares for the benefit of the holders of Depositary Interests.\nWe have entered into depositary arrangements to enable investors to settle and pay for our shares through CREST, which is the central securities depository in the U.K. The rights of holders of Depositary Interests will be governed by, among other things, the relevant provisions of the CREST Manual and the CREST Rules (as defined in the CREST Terms and Conditions issued by Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (\u201cEUI\u201d)). As the registered holder, the Depositary will have the power to exercise voting and other rights conferred by Delaware law and the bylaws of Worldpay on behalf of the relevant holder. Consequently, the holders of Depositary Interests must rely on the Depositary to exercise such rights for the benefit of the holders of Depositary Interests. Although we have entered into arrangements whereby EUI makes a copy of the register of the names and addresses of holders of Depositary Interests available to the Company to enable it to send out notices of shareholder meetings and proxy forms to its holders of Depositary Interests and pursuant to EUI\u2019s omnibus proxy arrangements, subject to certain requirements, the Depositary is be able to give each beneficial owner of a Depositary Interest the right to vote directly in respect of such owner\u2019s underlying Worldpay Shares, there can be no assurance that such information, and consequently, all such rights and, entitlements, will at all times be duly and timely passed on or that such proxy arrangements will be effective.\nThere is currently a limited U.K. market for the Depositary Interests, which could adversely affect the liquidity and price of the Depositary Interests.\nBecause of the relatively low trading volume of the Depositary Interests listed on the London Stock Exchange (\u201cLSE\u201d), investors in the United Kingdom may have a limited ability to dispose of their Worldpay shares. Although our current intention is that the Depositary Interests will continue to trade on the LSE, we cannot assure investors that this will always be the case. In addition, an active U.K. trading market for the Depositary Interests may never develop or, if developed, may not be maintained. Investors, particularly investors outside of the United States, may be unable to sell their Depositary Interests unless a market can be established and maintained, and if we subsequently obtain a further listing on an exchange in addition to, or in lieu of, the LSE, the level of liquidity of the Depositary Interests may decline.\nOur Class A common stock and the Depositary Interests are listed on two separate markets and investors seeking to take advantage of price differences between such markets may create unexpected volatility in our share price. In addition, investors may not be able to easily move shares for trading between such markets.\nShares of our Class A common stock and the Depositary Interests are listed and traded on the NYSE and the LSE, respectively. While our shares are traded on both markets, price and volume levels could fluctuate significantly on either market, independent from the share price or trading volume on the other market. Investors could seek to sell or buy our shares to take advantage of any price differences between the two markets through a process referred to as arbitrage. Any arbitrage activity could create unexpected volatility in both the price of our shares on either exchange and in the volume of our shares available for trading on either market. In addition, holders of our shares in either jurisdiction will not immediately be able to transfer such shares for trading on the other market without effecting necessary procedures with our transfer agents/registrars. This could result in time delays and additional cost for our Shareholders.\nThe standard listing of our shares affords investors a lower level of regulatory protection than a premium listing.\nThe Depositary Interests are admitted to the standard segment of the Official List of the LSE. A standard listing affords investors in Worldpay a lower level of regulatory protection than that afforded to investors in a company with a premium listing, which is subject to additional obligations under the Listing Rules. A standard listing also does not permit us to gain a FTSE UK Index Series indexation (which includes the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices), which may have an adverse effect on the price of the Depositary Interests.", "PERMNO": 13314, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "WP"}
