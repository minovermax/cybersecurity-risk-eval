Risk Factors\nRisk Factor Summary\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our business, operating results, financial condition, financial performance or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties, as well as by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of these risks occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Customers, Industry and Competition\n\u2022\nThe New York City Law Department recently advised us that the City of New York is investigating certain aspects of our installation work for our largest customer, the City of New York Department of Transportation (\u201cNYCDOT\u201d), and the failure to resolve the situation in a timely and effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur Commercial Services and Government Solutions segments both have customer concentration that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our revenues from key customers in both our Commercial Services segment and our Government Solutions segment.\n\u2022\nOur government contracts are subject to unique risks and uncertainties, including termination rights, delays in payment, audits and investigations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nAny decreases in the prevalence of automated and other similar methods of photo enforcement or the use of tolling could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nWe face intense competition and any failure to keep up with technological developments and changing customer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nOur new products and services and changes to existing products and services may not succeed.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\n\u2022\nOur inability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy and Cybersecurity\n\u2022\nA failure in or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to laws of the United States and foreign jurisdictions relating to privacy, data retention and individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with these laws, whether or not inadvertent, and changes to these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management\n\u2022\nWe depend on the services of key executives and any inability to attract and retain key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\n\u2022\nOur operations in international markets exposes us to additional risks, and failure to manage those risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022\nFailure to acquire necessary intellectual property or adequately protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\u2022\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could cause our business to suffer and incurring additional debt could intensify debt-related risks.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock, Warrants, Related Party Transactions and Organizational Documents\n\u2022\nPlatinum Equity has significant influence over us.\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nRisks Related to Our Vendors\n\u2022\nOur reliance on third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\n\u2022\nLitigation and other disputes and regulatory investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDue to the risk factors discussed below, as well as other factors affecting our business, operating results, financial condition, financial performance or prospects, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have caused severe disruption to the global economy. In order to comply with certain government restrictions and safeguard our employees, we have temporarily shifted most of our workforce to remote operations and have implemented changes in our physical locations to ensure social distancing. While we have not experienced any significant disruptions in our operations to date, these measures may result in decreases in productivity, an increased risk of information\nsecurity breaches and delays in responses to our customers, which could harm customer relations and adversely impact our business. COVID-19 may also cause us to temporarily suspend or ultimately forego strategic acquisitions, business initiatives or expansions into new markets. Also, our existing customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate their contracts with us or seek pricing concessions as a result of changes in their business needs or financial condition. The measures implemented to contain COVID-19 have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position, both in the near term and on a year-over-year basis.\nHistorical data regarding our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may not reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures and therefore does not purport to be representative of our future performance.\nThe information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other reports filed with the SEC include information regarding our business, properties, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity as of dates and for periods before the impact of COVID-19 and related containment measures (including quarantines, governmental orders requiring the closure of certain businesses, limiting travel, requiring that individuals stay at home or shelter in place and closing borders, and vaccines). This historical information therefore may not reflect the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and the related containment measures. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on historical information regarding our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, as that data does not reflect the adverse impact of COVID-19 and therefore does not purport to be representative of the future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or other financial or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Customers, Industry and Competition\nThe New York City Law Department recently advised us that the City of New York is investigating certain aspects of our installation work for our largest customer, NYCDOT. While we are cooperating with the investigation, including remediating issues identified to us, we cannot predict when this matter will be resolved, how much it may cost to do so, any liabilities, fines or penalties that may be assessed against us in connection with this matter, or the timing of receivables to be paid to us.\nWe provide photo enforcement and school zone enforcement services to NYCDOT, which was our largest customer by revenue in 2020 (31.3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020), under two primary contracts: a legacy contract relating to red light, bus lane, mobile speed and fixed speed photo enforcement cameras that were installed prior to fiscal year 2020 (the \u201cLegacy Contract\u201d), and an emergency contract for the purchase, installation, maintenance and operation of an expanded fixed speed camera program beginning in 2020 (the \u201cEmergency Contract\u201d). In late 2019, we concluded that some of our system installations under the Legacy Contract did not meet New York City\u2019s requirements related to the depth of buried electrical conduit and the color of grounding wire. We disclosed these issues to NYCDOT and in the fourth quarter of 2020 agreed to remediate the affected sites. Since that time, we have been actively remediating the affected installations and, as of December 31, 2020, we incurred costs of $0.9 million and accrued an additional $2.1 million to complete the remediation.\nIn addition, during 2020 we worked with NYCDOT to address various administrative hurdles that we understood at the time to be delaying payments on our invoices under the Legacy Contract and the registration of the Emergency Contract, which is a condition to payment under that contract. In late January 2021, we were separately informed that the City of New York\u2019s Law Department is investigating matters related to the Company\u2019s previously disclosed conduit depth issue as well as whether the Company unnecessarily installed new poles where existing infrastructure could have been used. We are fully cooperating with the investigation.\nThe installation issues described in this risk factor did not have any impact on the camera operations or the overall effectiveness of the photo enforcement programs. We will continue to perform work for NYCDOT under the Legacy Contract and the Emergency Contract, and are finalizing operating and compliance procedures that govern the remaining remediation and future work for NYCDOT.\nAt December 31, 2020, NYCDOT had an open receivables balance on these contracts of $98.9 million, of which $80.4 million had aged beyond NYCDOT\u2019s 45-day payment terms. This $98.9 million balance is up from the $10.0 million owed at December 31, 2019. We expect the NYCDOT open receivables balance to increase by approximately $7.3 million per month until it is paid. Largely as a result of NYCDOT\u2019s non-payment of receivables\nand a slowing in our business generally due to COVID-19, our net cash provided by operating activities declined from $133.8 million in 2019 to $46.9 million in 2020. Further, because of their overdue nature, our NYCDOT receivables are not eligible for inclusion in our borrowing base calculation under our revolving credit facility. Availability under that facility was $48.8 million, net of $6.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, at December 31, 2020, as compared to $63.5 million, net of $0.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, at December 31, 2019.\nWe cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or how much it may cost, any liabilities, fines or penalties that may be assessed against us or the timing of payments on the outstanding receivables. The failure to resolve the matter with the City of New York in a timely and effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Commercial Services and Government Solutions segments both have customer concentration that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business experiences customer concentration from time to time. For example, our Commercial Services segment is dependent on certain key customers, including those in the RAC industry, such as Avis Budget Group, Inc., Enterprise Holdings, Inc. and The Hertz Corporation. The health of the RAC industry is impacted by a variety of factors, including seasonality, increases in energy prices, general international, national and local economic conditions and cycles, as well as other factors affecting travel levels, such as military conflicts, terrorist incidents, natural disasters and epidemic diseases. For example, as described elsewhere in these risk factors, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our key customers in the RAC industry and, correspondingly, revenues in our Commercial Services segment.\nWe also experience customer concentration in our Government Solutions segment. As discussed above, NYCDOT represented approximately 31.3% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020, and our contract with NYCDOT, like many other contracts, is subject to unique risks and uncertainties, including termination rights, delays in payment and audits and investigations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the future, a small number of customers in our Government Solutions segment may continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in any given period. The loss of any of our top Government Solutions customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our revenues from key customers in both our Commercial Services segment and our Government Solutions segment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant negative impact on the RAC industry, including key customers in our Commercial Services segment. Reduced airline travel and widespread travel restrictions resulted in declining customer demand and many RACs have responded by reducing fleet sizes. In May 2020, The Hertz Corporation, one of our key Commercial Services customers, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Because revenue from agreements with our RAC customers is largely based on a margin-share model, any changes to our RAC customers\u2019 pricing or pricing model for tolling, such as changing from charging their customers per rental day to per toll usage day, could have a material impact on the revenue we realize under those agreements. Further, although we have long-term agreements with many of our RAC customers, most provide the customer with a termination right in certain situations, including if we commit an uncured material breach of the agreement. The full extent and duration of COVID-19\u2019s impact on the RAC industry and the financial health of our key RAC customers cannot be predicted at this time. If our RAC customers continue to experience adversity in their businesses or file for bankruptcy, they may delay or default on their payment commitments to us or request to modify or renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments on terms that are less favorable to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue from our customers in our Government Solutions segment also continues to be impacted by COVID-19. Stay at home orders, the switch to remote operations for large amounts of the population, and the related containment measures have additionally resulted in reductions in vehicle traffic, which in turn resulted in some of our Government Solutions customers temporarily taking enforcement camera systems offline. Additionally, school closures resulting from COVID-19 have resulted in limited operations of our school bus stop arm solutions. Continued or additional measures or changes in laws or regulations, whether in the United States or abroad, that further impair the ability or desire of individuals to gather or travel due to the risk of the spreading of COVID-19, including laws or regulations banning travel or requiring the closure of schools, could have a material adverse effect\non our Government Solutions segment, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur government contracts are subject to unique risks and uncertainties, including termination rights, delays in payment, audits and investigations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe enter into government contracts from time to time with customers in our Government Solutions segment that are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. For example, as of December 31, 2020, NYCDOT had an open receivable balance of $99.4 million, which represented 58.9% of our accounts receivable, net, of which $80.9 million had aged beyond NYCDOT\u2019s 45-day payment terms. For additional information on the risks and uncertainties relating to our contracts with NYCDOT, please see the risk factor entitled \u201cThe New York City Law Department recently advised us that the City of New York is investigating certain aspects of our installation work for our largest customer, NYCDOT\u201d above.\nGovernment entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including administrative hurdles, budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt or funding constraints, could result in our government contracts being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, as well as limit our ability to win new government work in the future.\nMoreover, if a government customer does not follow the requisite procurement or ordinance-specific administrative procedures, the contract may be subject to protest or voidable regardless of whether we bear any responsibility for the error. Our government contracts often include other one-sided, customer-friendly provisions and certifications, including broad indemnification provisions and uncapped exposure or liquidated damages for certain liabilities, which can impose obligations, requirements, and liabilities on us that are beyond those associated with a typical commercial arrangement.\nIn addition, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies or higher-tier government contractors. If improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance are identified, including improper billing or vendor non-compliance, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, the imposition of fines, penalties and sanctions, and suspensions or debarment from doing business for or on behalf of the government in the future. If penalties or other restrictions are imposed in one jurisdiction, it could also implicate similar provisions of contracts with other government customers in other jurisdictions. Further, the negative publicity related to these penalties, sanctions or findings in government audits or investigations could harm our reputation and hinder our ability to compete for new contracts with government customers and in the private sector. Any of the foregoing or any other reduction in revenue from government customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny decreases in the prevalence of automated and other similar methods of photo enforcement or the use of tolling could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe provide automated safety solutions to local government agencies, generating revenues through automated photo enforcement of red-light, school bus, speed limit and bus lane laws. In 2020, revenues from this segment represented approximately 54.1% of our revenues. Therefore, we depend on federal, state and local governments authorizing the use of automated photo enforcement and not otherwise materially restricting its use. In states that have enabling legislation, if that legislation is not renewed or is otherwise repealed, use of automated enforcement technology can be suspended until new legislation is passed. For example, in June 2019, the state of Texas passed a law prohibiting red-light photo enforcement programs across the state, with certain carve-outs for some existing programs. The passage of this law resulted in a loss of revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and a related impairment of assets in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBallot initiatives, referendums, opinions of attorneys general, and legal challenges can also be used to restrict the use of automated enforcement or to impose additional licensing requirements on its use. For example, the Attorneys General in the states of Arizona, Tennessee and Virginia have issued opinions that had the effect of limiting the use of these enforcement technologies or impacting the manner in which photo enforcement programs operate. Usage may also be affected if there is an unfavorable shift in political support for or public sentiment towards automated enforcement, or as a result of one or more scandals related to its use.\nSimilarly, our Commercial Services business may be materially impacted if there is an unfavorable shift in\npolitical support for or public sentiment towards tolling or its use is materially restricted or limited, including through the imposition of limits on the fees RAC companies can charge their customers for tolling services. Any material restriction or limitation on the use of automated enforcement or material reduction in its use in the markets we serve, or any similar changes with respect to tolling, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and any failure to keep up with technological developments and changing customer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe markets for our solutions are increasingly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and are subject to changing technology and shifting customer needs. A number of vendors develop and market products and services that compete to varying extents with our offerings, and we expect this competition to continue to intensify. The rapid rate of technological change in our industry could increase the chances that we will face competition from new products or services designed by companies that we do not currently compete with. Moreover, we face competition from our own customers as they may choose to invest in developing their own internal solutions.\nCompetition in our markets is primarily based on (a) the quality, reliability and efficacy of the solution; (b) customer awareness of offerings; (c) pricing; (d) functionality and features, including ease of use and broad application; (e) the customer experience; (f) the breadth and depth of products and services offered; (g) reputation and track record; (h) technical expertise; and (i) security.\nCurrently, we compete with several other companies, ranging from small, regional or specialized firms to large, diversified companies. Some of our existing competitors and potential new competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, less debt, more established customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, research and development, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In some cases, our competitors may be better positioned to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, and we may have to reduce our pricing to retain existing business or obtain new business. If we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our solutions, our profit margin and profitability could suffer. In addition, if a prospective customer is currently using a competing solution, the customer may be unwilling to switch to our solution without setup support services or other incentives. Certain existing and new competitors may be better positioned to acquire competitive solutions, effectively negotiate third-party licenses and other strategic relationships, and take advantage of acquisition or other similar expansion opportunities. Industry consolidation could further increase competition, and competitors may also establish relationships or form alliances. Any failure to achieve our target pricing levels, maintain existing customer relationships, generate additional customer wins or otherwise successfully compete would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur new products and services and changes to existing products and services may not succeed.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our customer base and to increase our revenue depends, in large part, on our ability to continue to evolve existing solutions and to create successful new solutions. We may introduce significant changes to our existing solutions or acquire or introduce new and unproven products and services, including using technologies or entering markets or industries in which we have little or no experience. For example, in September 2018, we launched Peasy, our cloud-based, pay-as-you-go tolling solution targeting consumers, a market segment that we had not previously targeted directly. Consumer adoption of Peasy was slower than anticipated, and the product did not generate meaningful revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, and we therefore ceased marketing and further investment in Peasy. We have only indirect exposure to the consumer segment through our business with the RAC industry, but in those instances, our customer controls the pricing, marketing, consumer disclosures and other aspects of the consumer relationship. As such, the consumers\u2019 view of us and their willingness to try our solutions may be impacted by their experience with our tolling services delivered by our RAC customers. Additionally, our rollout of RAC tolling has been slower than anticipated. The failure of any new or enhanced solution to achieve customer adoption or our failure to otherwise successfully monetize our development efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe regularly pursue contracts and contract renewals, particularly in our Government Solutions segment, that require competitive bidding, which can involve substantial costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of the government contracts and renewals for which we bid, particularly those for certain larger government customers, are extremely complex and require the investment of significant resources in order to prepare accurate bids and proposals. Further, a significant percentage of new customer growth opportunities in our Government Solutions and EPC businesses are only accessible through competitive bidding. Competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents several risks, including significant time and effort and the commitment of resources, regardless of whether the job is ultimately won. We may also be unable to meet the requirements of a solicitation or may have to incur substantial costs to be able to do so. These and other unanticipated costs related to the competitive bidding process, including advancing or defending bid protests, and any failure to win renewals or new customer accounts through the competitive bidding process, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to recover capital and other investments in connection with our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe sometimes make significant capital and other investments to attract and retain certain contracts, such as the cost of purchasing information technology equipment, constructing and installing photo enforcement systems and developing and implementing software and labor resources. The net book value of certain assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired in the event of the early termination of some or all of a contract or a reduction in volume and services under the contract for any number of reasons, including the failure or deterioration of the customer\u2019s business, a customer\u2019s exercise of contract termination or program cancellation rights or a change in law or interpretation thereof that suspends or terminates photo enforcement activities. Any failure to recover our investments underlying customer agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2019, the state of Texas passed a law prohibiting red-light photo enforcement programs across the state, with certain carve-outs for some existing programs. The passage of this law resulted in a loss of revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and a related impairment of assets for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\nOur inability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have grown in large part as a result of our recent acquisitions, including the acquisitions of HTA, EPC and Pagatelia, and we recently signed an agreement to acquire Redflex, and we anticipate continuing to grow in this manner. Although we expect to regularly consider additional strategic transactions in the future, we may not identify suitable opportunities or, if we do identify prospects, it may not be possible to consummate a transaction on acceptable terms. Antitrust or other competition laws may also limit our ability to acquire or work collaboratively with certain businesses or to fully realize the benefits of a prospective acquisition. Furthermore, a significant change in our business or the economy, an unexpected decrease in our cash flows or any restrictions imposed by our indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain the necessary capital or otherwise impede our ability to complete a transaction. Regularly considering strategic transactions can also divert management\u2019s attention and lead to significant due diligence and other expenses regardless of whether we pursue or consummate any transaction. Failure to identify suitable transaction partners and to consummate transactions on acceptable terms, as well as the commitment of time and resources in connection with such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to successfully integrate our recent or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn January 2021 we entered into an agreement to acquire Redflex, and we recently acquired HTA, EPC and Pagatelia. The integration of acquired businesses requires significant time and exposes us to significant risks and additional costs. Integrating these and other acquired businesses may strain our resources. Further, we may have difficulty integrating the operations, systems, controls, procedures or products of acquired businesses and may not be able to do so in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner.\nThese difficulties could include:\n\u2022\ncombining management teams, strategies and philosophies;\n\u2022\nmerging or linking different accounting and financial reporting systems and systems of internal controls;\n\u2022\nassimilating personnel, human resources and other administrative departments and potentially contrasting corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nmerging computer, technology and other information networks and systems;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our relationship with or losing key customers, suppliers or personnel; and\n\u2022\ninterference with, or loss of momentum in, our ongoing business or that of the acquired company.\nWe have not fully integrated HTA, EPC or Pagatelia and may encounter one or more of the issues discussed above, or others of which we are not yet aware. We have determined not to fully integrate HTA\u2019s operating systems onto our legacy information technology systems, which could lead to separate risks and inefficiencies. Any of these acquisition or other integration-related issues could cause significant disruption to our business, divert the attention of management and lead to substantial additional costs and delays. Our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including unanticipated expenses and liabilities related to acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe pursue each acquisition with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including growth opportunities and synergies from increased efficiencies. However, even if we are able to successfully integrate an acquired business, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits within the anticipated timeframes or at all. Furthermore, we may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business, we may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, and general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. Acquisitions also expose us to significant risks and costs, and business and operational overlaps may lead to hidden costs. These costs can include unforeseen pre-acquisition liabilities or the impairment of customer relationships or acquired assets, such as goodwill. We may also incur costs and inefficiencies to the extent an acquisition expands the industries, markets or geographies in which we operate due to our limited exposure to and experience in a given industry, market or region. For example, our January 2021 agreement to acquire Redflex exposes us to currency fluctuations and conversion risks because the purchase price is in Australian dollars, which presents the risk of loss from the conversion of U.S. dollars to Australian dollars at the time of closing. Significant acquisitions may also require us to incur additional debt to finance the transactions, which could limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations for other purposes. Acquisitions often involve post-transaction disputes with the counterparty regarding a number of matters, including disagreements over the amount of a purchase price or other working capital adjustment or disputes regarding whether certain liabilities are covered by the indemnification provisions of the transaction agreement. We may underestimate the level of certain costs or the exposure we may face as a result of acquired liabilities. If any of these or other factors limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of a transaction, or we encounter other unexpected transaction-related costs and liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy and Cybersecurity\nA failure in or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe act as a trusted business partner in both front office and back office platforms, interacting with our customers and other third parties. Our customers include large, multinational corporations and government agencies who depend upon our operational efficiency, non-interruption of service, and accuracy and security of information. We receive, process, transmit and store substantial volumes of information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a back-end or direct-to-consumer service provider and as an employer, and receive, process and implement financial transactions, and disburse funds, which requires us to receive debit and credit card information. We also use third-party providers such as subcontractors, software vendors, utility providers and network providers, upon whom we rely to offer our products, services and solutions. As a result of these and other aspects of our business, the integrity, security and accuracy of our systems and information technology, and that of the third parties\nwith which we interact, including our customers and other government agencies with which we work, are extremely important.\nOur cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of the third parties with which we interact, may be damaged, disrupted or otherwise breached for a number of reasons, including power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, malware or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and remote work arrangements instituted in response to COVID-19. Our visibility and role as a processor of transactions containing personally identifiable information may also put us at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. The perception that the COVID-19 pandemic has made companies\u2019 information technology systems more vulnerable has additionally increased the already significant volume of such attempts.\nIn addition, numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in our systems as well as those of the third parties with which we interact. The security measures and procedures we and the third parties with which we interact have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. Further, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of security measures or a system breach. Although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, in each case that we believe are reasonable and appropriate, these efforts, and the efforts of third parties with which we interact, may not prevent these or other threats.\nMoreover, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we and the third parties with which we interact may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities or diligencing those of third parties.\nIf we are sued in connection with any data security breach or system failure, we could be involved in protracted litigation. In addition, a breach could lead to unfavorable publicity and significant damage to our brand, the loss of existing and potential customers, allegations by customers that we have not performed or breached our contractual obligations, or decreased use and acceptance of our solutions. A breach or failure may also subject us to additional regulations or governmental or regulatory scrutiny, which could result in significant compliance costs, fines or enforcement actions, or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to operate our business. A security breach would also likely require us to devote significant management and other resources to address the problems created by the security breach. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws of the United States and foreign jurisdictions relating to privacy, data retention and individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with these laws, whether or not inadvertent, and changes to these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service provider and as an employer. In addition, we receive, process, transmit and store other sensitive data, such as photographs taken and video recorded, as part of our Government Solutions programs. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations regarding privacy and data retention, including regulations by government agencies, such as the FTC, and state, local and foreign agencies. Our data handling also is subject to contractual obligations and industry standards. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising and other communications with individuals and businesses. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. A number of foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. These laws often include obligations on companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or our third-party\nservice providers.\nThese and other laws, regulations and standards relating to privacy are evolving, can be subject to significant change and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. The laws and regulations may also be subject to new or different interpretations. For example, in May 2018, the GDPR replaced prior EU regulations, effectively extending the scope of EU data protection law to all non-EU companies processing data of EU residents when certain conditions are satisfied. The GDPR contains numerous, more stringent requirements and changes from prior EU law, including more robust obligations on data processors, greater rights for data subjects, and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. The GDPR also provides for increased fines of the greater of up to \u20ac20 million or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company. Further, certain of our U.S. customers, through contractual requirements, could require us to conform all aspects of our business to these more stringent regulations, regardless of whether all of our operations are actually subject to the GDPR.\nIn June 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which took effect in January 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal data is used. The law also provides for civil penalties against companies that fail to comply and creates a private right of action for data breaches. Significant regulations to implement portions of the CCPA were finalized in August of 2020, but a newly proposed set of rule changes was proposed in December 2020. Moreover, a ballot initiative for new privacy laws, including the creation of a new privacy regulatory enforcement agency, will create further changes to the California Privacy Laws through January 2023, when the new laws are scheduled to take effect. Additionally, other state legislatures have proposed bills which will be taken up in 2021, and Congress is considering several privacy bills at the federal level.\nThe costs of compliance with these privacy-related laws, regulations and industry standards may limit the use or adoption of our solutions, reduce overall demand for our solutions or slow the pace at which we generate revenues. Moreover, if our policies, procedures, or measures relating to these issues fail to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, or industry standards, we may be subject to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties and negative publicity, and our application providers, customers and partners may lose trust in or stop doing business with us entirely. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use and disclosure of the personally identifiable information provided to us by our website visitors and mobile app users. Our publication of our privacy policies and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential liability if they are found to be insufficient, defective, deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices.\nWe are subject to domestic and foreign laws relating to processing certain financial transactions, including debit or credit card transactions, and failure to comply with those laws, even if inadvertent, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe process, support and execute financial transactions as part of our business and disburse funds on behalf of certain of our customers. This activity includes receiving debit and credit card information, processing payments for and due to our customers and disbursing funds on payment or debit cards to payees of our customers. As a result, we may be subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act) and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d).\nWe are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to privacy and information security, electronic fund transfers, payment services and convenience fees. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional liability, including governmental fines or other sanctions, and we could be forced to otherwise change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures to preserve and protect credit card and other payment data against loss, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, unauthorized access or misuse. Notwithstanding these policies and procedures, we could be subject to liability claims by individuals and customers whose data resides in our databases for the misuse of that information. If we fail to meet appropriate compliance levels, this could negatively impact our ability to utilize credit cards as a method of payment, or collect and store credit card information, which could disrupt our business. Failure to comply with these laws may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process and support financial transactions and allegations by customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management\nWe depend on the services of key executives and any inability to attract and retain key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who have critical experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan and growth strategy. Additionally, as our business grows, we may need to attract and hire additional management personnel. We have employment agreements with some members of senior management that include non-competition provisions\u037e however, we cannot prevent our executives from terminating their employment and may not be able to fully enforce non-competition provisions limiting former executives from competing with us following any departure. Moreover, we do not carry \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on the lives of our executive officers, employees or advisors. Our ability to retain our key management personnel or to identify and attract additional management personnel or suitable replacements should any members of the management team leave or be terminated is dependent on a number of factors, including the competitive nature of the employment market and our industry. Any failure to retain key management personnel or to attract additional or suitable replacement personnel could cause uncertainty among investors, employees, customers and others concerning our future direction and performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to attract and retain necessary skilled personnel and qualified subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends on highly skilled technical, managerial, engineering, sales, marketing and customer support personnel and qualified and competent subcontractors. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially during times of low unemployment or economic recovery or growth. Any failure to attract, hire, assimilate in a timely manner and retain and motivate key qualified personnel, particularly software development, product development, analytics and other technical personnel, or inability to contract with qualified, competent subcontractors, could impair our success. Additionally, certain portions of our Government Solutions operations are dependent on employees who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. When the collective bargaining agreement becomes subject to renegotiation or if we face union organizing drives, any disagreement between us and the union on important issues may lead to a strike, work slowdown or other job actions in one or more locations we serve. A strike, work slowdown or other job action could disrupt our services, resulting in reduced revenues or contract cancellations. State or local law in some jurisdictions requires that subcontractors for our Government Solutions segment are certified by the jurisdiction, and the failure on the part of our subcontractors to obtain and maintain such certification could impact their ability to perform services for us. Further, our acquisition activity could increase the challenge of retaining our key employees and subcontractors and those of the acquired businesses. The loss of any key technical employee or the termination of a key subcontractor relationship, and any inability to identify suitable replacements or offer reasonable terms to these candidates, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nOur operations in international markets expose us to additional risks, and failure to manage those risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), the Netherlands, France, Ireland, Spain and Hungary. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to successfully manage these foreign operations. Our\ninternational operations subject us to risks that could increase expenses, restrict our ability to operate, result in lost revenues or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability, including the on-going impact of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU and European sovereign debt issues and tightening of government budgets\u037e\n\u2022\nwars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts;\n\u2022\nincreased complexity and costs of managing or overseeing foreign operations, including adapting and localizing our services to specific regions and countries and relying on different third-party service providers;\n\u2022\nlocal business and cultural factors and customs that may differ from our normal standards and practices;\n\u2022\ncomplying with tariffs, trade restrictions, and trade agreements and any changes thereto;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange and other restrictions and limitations on the transfer or repatriation of funds;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncomplying with varying legal and regulatory environments in multiple foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to data and consumer privacy and payment processing, labor matters and VAT, and unexpected changes in these laws, regulatory requirements, and the enforcement thereof; and\n\u2022\nlimited protection of our intellectual property and other assets as compared to the laws of the United States.\nThe UK formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020 and the transition period, during which EU rules and regulations continued to apply, ended on December 31, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d), finally agreed to between the EU and UK on December 24, 2020, came into force on January 1, 2021, and is expected to be formally approved by the EU legislature in March 2021. The TCA goes some way to liberalizing trade in goods between the UK and EU. However, in terms of trade in services, cooperation between national authorities, and business travel, the TCA introduces rules that are far more restrictive than those offered by membership in the EU\u2019s Single Market, and the overall impact on the movement of goods, services, people and capital between the U.K. and the EU, as well as customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters remains to be seen. Economists predict that Brexit will lead to some short-term disruption in the UK and a longer-term reduction in GDP. The impact of more restrictive rules, including additional inspections and documentation checks, on cross-border services may have an impact on our wholly owned subsidiary, EPC, as their effects become clearer. Also, the inability for the UK and EU vehicle licensing authorities to transfer certain data using current methods may have an impact on EPC\u2019s ability to obtain information that is necessary to its operations in certain parts of the EU. These restrictions may have an impact on EPC\u2019s ability to obtain information that is necessary to its operations in certain parts of the EU. In addition, EPC\u2019s ability to obtain information from its customers outside the UK may also be adversely impacted. The EU has agreed under the TCA to allow EU personal data to be transferred to the UK for up to six additional months on current terms, pending an expected \u2018adequacy\u2019 decision in June 2021, which will allow permanent free flow of personal data.\nWe have limited or no control over these and other factors related to international operations and our strategies to address these risks may not correctly anticipate any problems that arise or be successful in expanding our solutions from the United States into new European markets. Any failure to successfully manage these and other similar risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth is dependent on successfully implementing our international expansion strategy.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding our global footprint, which may involve moving into regions and countries beyond those in which we currently operate. In order to achieve widespread acceptance in new markets we may enter, we may need to develop new products and services or tailor our existing products and services to that market\u2019s unique customs, cultures and standards. We have an office in the Netherlands to serve as the headquarters for our European business, as well as EPC offices in London and Budapest and a Pagatelia office in Madrid. Additionally, we have subsidiaries in France and Ireland. Management of these and future European subsidiaries may divert our resources and require significant attention from management. In addition to the risks inherent in\nconducting international business, expanding into Europe with new and existing customers poses additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nlack of acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022\ntax issues, including administration of value-added tax, restrictions on repatriating earnings, and with respect to our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements;\n\u2022\nour limited historical sale experience to RACs outside the United States;\n\u2022\nour limited experience dealing with toll charging authorities outside the United States, many of which have differing requirements relating to payment options, penalty and late fee protocols and operating rules;\n\u2022\nour ability to adapt our marketing and selling efforts to different cultures and customers;\n\u2022\na different competitive environment, including a number of smaller competitors and a more fragmented business model that allows RACs and FMCs to perform some of the services we offer for themselves, as well as competition from other market participants; and\n\u2022\nan unfamiliar regulatory environment, including different local, national and EU-wide regulations relating to payment processing, payment services, debt collection, privacy, consumer credit and consumer protection.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our relationships with our existing and prospective customers, strategic partners and employees and our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected.\nIn many cases, we will have limited or no experience in a particular region or country where we intend to launch operations. Moreover, learning the customs and cultures, particularly with respect to consumer preferences, differing technology standards and language barriers, is a difficult task. Our failure to do so effectively could slow our growth in those regions or countries. In many of these markets, long-standing relationships between potential customers and their local partners and protective regulations, including local content requirements and approvals, and disparate networks and systems used by each country, will create barriers to entry. Difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies and of foreign financial institutions, particularly in emerging markets, could also adversely affect demand in the affected areas. For this strategy to be successful, we must generate sufficient revenues and margins from the new markets to offset the expense of the expansion. Moreover, as the scale of our international operations increases, we will be more susceptible to the general risks related to our existing international operations discussed above. If we are unable to further expand internationally or if we are unable to effectively and efficiently manage the complexity of our expanded operations and compete in these new regions and countries, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with anticorruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations subject us to anticorruption and other similar laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally, which are often evolving, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the Patriot Act, and comparable foreign anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. Our domestic activities, particularly those related to our Government Solutions business, are also subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding similar matters. These laws and regulations prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or other benefits to government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person or securing any advantage.\nWe use various third parties to conduct our business, both domestically and abroad, and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors or subcontractors, partners, and agents, those of the third parties with which we do business or those of any businesses we acquire, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities or they occurred prior to our acquisition of the relevant business. Safeguards we implement to discourage these practices may prove to be ineffective and any internal investigations may not uncover any such practices that may exist. Violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws by us or any of these third parties can result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, including class action lawsuits, whistleblower complaints, enforcement\nactions by the SEC, Department of Justice, and U.S. state and local and foreign regulators, adverse media coverage, non-responsibility determinations by procuring agencies, and suspension or debarment from government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nFailure to acquire necessary intellectual property or adequately protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property against infringement, misappropriation and dilution. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions. We have registered certain patents and trademarks and have applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for some inventions and trademarks, including the Verra Mobility word mark and logo, for which some registrations have been granted and some applications are pending. However, not all of the trademarks and inventions we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of those countries, and the applications we submit for these protections may not be granted. While we make efforts to acquire rights to intellectual property necessary for our operations, these measures may not adequately protect our rights in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.\nIf we fail to acquire necessary intellectual property rights or adequately protect or assert our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products and services, or dilute our brands, which could adversely affect our market share. It may be possible for third parties to reverse engineer, otherwise obtain, copy, and use software or information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, our competitors may avoid application of our existing or future intellectual property rights. Further, patent rights, copyrights and contractual provisions may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products or services that are similar to or address the same market as our products and services. Failure to obtain registrations for the Verra Mobility word mark or logo may have a significant adverse impact on our brand. Moreover, some of our trademarks and services are descriptive or include descriptive elements, which may make it difficult to enforce our rights or prevent others from adopting and using similar marks. Competitive products and services could reduce the market value of our brands, products and services, inhibit attracting new customers or maintaining existing customers, lower our profits, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur measures to monitor and protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to maintain or enforce our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.\nDespite our efforts to monitor and protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to maintain or enforce our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Unauthorized third parties may use our trademarks and service marks, or marks that are similar thereto, to impinge on our goodwill, cause consumer confusion or dilute our rights in the marks. We are aware of products, software and marks similar to our intellectual property being used by other persons. Although we believe that such uses will not adversely affect us, further or currently unknown unauthorized uses or other infringement of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our intellectual property and may adversely affect our business. Even where we have effectively secured protection for our intellectual property, our competitors may challenge, infringe, misappropriate or dilute our intellectual property and our employees, consultants, contractors, customers and suppliers may breach their contractual obligations not to reveal our confidential information, including trade secrets. Additionally, defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights and agreements, and seeking an injunction or compensation for infringements or misappropriations, could result in expending significant resources and diverting management attention, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been and may become subject to third-party infringement claims or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have faced, and may in the future face, claims for infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights from intellectual property owners in areas where we operate or intend to operate, including in foreign jurisdictions. Such claims may or may not be unfounded. Regardless of whether such claims have merit, our image, brands, competitive position and ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions may be harmed and we may incur significant costs related to defense or settlement. If such claims were decided against us or a third party we indemnify pursuant to license terms, we could be required to pay damages, develop or adopt non-infringing products or services, or acquire a license to the intellectual property that is the subject of the asserted claim, which license may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nDefending or settling claims would require the expenditure of additional capital, and negative publicity could arise, even if the matter was ultimately decided in our favor. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth into new territories and technologies may be hindered or blocked by pre-existing third-party rights.\nWe act to obtain and protect intellectual property rights to operate successfully in those territories where we operate and intend to expand. Certain intellectual property rights including rights in trademarks and patents are national in character, and are obtained on a country-by-country basis by the first person to obtain protection through use or registration in that country in connection with specified products and services. As our business grows, we continuously evaluate the potential for expansion into new territories and new products and services. There is a risk with each expansion, including for pending applications, that growth will be limited or unavailable due to pre-existing third-party intellectual property rights.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could cause our business to suffer and incurring additional debt could intensify debt-related risks.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, including approximately $865.6 million outstanding under our first lien term loan facility as of December 31, 2020. We may also incur substantial additional debt in the future to, among other things, finance our acquisition strategy. Depending on borrowing availability, we have the ability to draw up to $75.0 million of commitments under our revolving credit facility, which includes an option for an uncommitted accordion to increase commitments by up to $50.0 million, all of which will be secured. Our borrowing availability at December 31, 2020 was $48.8 million due to the large ineligible accounts receivable balance with NYCDOT. We also have the ability to draw upon the uncommitted accordion provided under the first lien term loan facility of up to $200.0 million, plus the sum of all voluntary prepayments of the first lien term loan facility and certain permitted indebtedness, plus an unlimited amount subject to the satisfaction of a maximum total net leverage ratio or minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, in each case, on a pro forma basis, all of which will be secured. Our substantial debt could have important consequences, any of which could be intensified if new debt is added to our current debt levels. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nexpose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on certain of our debt is variable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our general business obligations, including our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance indebtedness or increase the associated costs;\n\u2022\nrequire us to sell assets to reduce debt or influence our decision about whether to do so;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or prevent us from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any competitors that have less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns.\nIn addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in activities that may be in our and their long-term best interests.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness could restrict our operating flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness limit our ability to take certain actions. These restrictions may limit our ability to operate our businesses, prohibit or limit our ability to enhance our operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and cause us to take actions that are not favorable to stockholders.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or other payments on capital stock;\n\u2022\nguarantee other obligations;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake loans, acquisitions or other investments;\n\u2022\ntransfer or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake optional payments or modify certain debt instruments;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\namend organizational documents;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\nenter into arrangements that restrict the ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nengage in business activities that are materially different from existing business activities;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of the business we conduct; and\n\u2022\ndesignate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nUnder our first lien term loan facility, we could be required to make periodic prepayments based on excess cash flow (as defined by the first lien term loan agreement) thereby limiting the amount of cash flow that can be reinvested in our business. For example, under our revolving credit facility, if availability goes below a certain threshold, we will be required to comply with a minimum \u201cconsolidated fixed charge coverage ratio\u201d financial covenant as calculated therein. Moreover, if availability falls below a certain threshold for a specified number of business days, we could be required to remit our cash funds to a dominion account maintained by the administrative agent to the revolving credit facility, which would require daily review and approval of operating disbursements by the administrative agent.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in agreements governing our indebtedness may be affected by economic conditions and by financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will also depend substantially on the pricing and sales volume of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In that case, we may be unable to borrow under our revolving credit agreement or otherwise, may not be able to repay the amounts due under the agreements governing our indebtedness, and may not be able to make cash available by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. In addition, our lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. Any of the foregoing could have serious consequences to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions that may cause all of the debt issued under those instruments to become immediately due and payable because of a default under an unrelated debt instrument.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain numerous covenants and require us, if availability goes below a certain threshold, to comply with a minimum \u201cconsolidated fixed charge coverage ratio\u201d financial covenant as calculated in the revolving credit agreement. Our failure to comply with the obligations contained in these agreements or other instruments governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the applicable instrument, which could result in the related debt and the debt issued under other instruments (together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees) becoming immediately due and payable. In such event, we would need to raise funds from alternative sources, which funds may not be available to us on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. Alternatively, such a default could require us to sell assets and otherwise curtail our operations in order to pay\nour creditors. These alternative measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flows, we may not be able to service all of our indebtedness.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or to repay indebtedness when it matures, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets or operations, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We may not be able to refinance our debt and any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more restrictive covenants that could further restrict our business operations and our ability to make cash available for dividends and distributions and payments on our other debt obligations (if any). Our ability to implement successfully any such alternative financing plans will be dependent on a range of factors, including general economic conditions, the level of activity in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets generally, and the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. In addition, a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our assets including our subsidiaries\u2019 assets, and any successor credit facilities are likely to be secured on a similar basis. As such, our ability to seek additional financing or our ability to make cash available for dividends and distributions and payments on our other debt obligations (if any) could be impaired as a result of such security interests and the agreements governing such security interests. Moreover, as a result of these security interests, the underlying assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our indebtedness and other obligations.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR may adversely affect our outstanding debt.\nThe London InterBank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, is scheduled to be phased out by the end of 2021. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to LIBOR, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. Our debt instrument has an interest rate that is based on LIBOR and will not have matured prior to the phase-out of LIBOR. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative floating borrowing rate, may adversely affect our borrowing costs. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative floating borrowing rates on our outstanding debt that is based on LIBOR. Transitioning to a different borrowing rate may result in less favorable pricing on our debt instruments and could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund operations and growth.\nWe may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth, whether organic or through acquisitions. Our failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our continued development or growth. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any future financing to us.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock, Warrants, Related Party Transactions and Organizational Documents\nPlatinum Equity has significant influence over us.\nPlatinum Equity, LLC, its sponsored funds and affiliated private equity investment vehicles (collectively, \u201cPlatinum Equity\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 14.94% of our Class A Common Stock as of December 31, 2020. As long as Platinum Equity owns or controls a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, it will have the ability to influence corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of\ndirectors and the size of our Board, any amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. Platinum Equity\u2019s influence over our management could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could cause the market price of our securities to decline or prevent security holders from realizing a premium over the market price for such securities. Under the Merger Agreement, Platinum Equity is entitled to receive additional shares of our Class A Common Stock if the volume weighted average closing price of our Class A Common Stock exceeds certain thresholds, as described in Part II, Item 5, below. Additionally, the earn-out shares issuable to the Platinum Stockholder accelerate upon a qualifying change of control. Finally, because our certificate of incorporation opts out of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating certain business combinations with interested stockholders, Platinum Equity may transfer shares to a third party by transferring their securities without the approval of our Board or other stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our securities.\nPursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Platinum Stockholder has the right to nominate up to three directors to the Board, depending on its ownership percentage. If one of the Platinum Stockholder\u2019s nominees is elected, one of the Platinum Stockholder\u2019s nominees will serve as the chairman of the Board, and the Platinum Stockholder will have the right to appoint one representative to each committee of the Board. The Platinum Stockholder\u2019s right to nominate directors to the Board is subject to its ownership percentage of the total outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. Jacob Kotzubei, the Chairman of our Board and Bryan Kelln are the current Platinum Stockholder nominees serving on our Board, the terms of whom run through our 2021 annual stockholder meeting. Changes in the Platinum Stockholder\u2019s ownership percentage during its respective nominees\u2019 terms do not require any director, including the Platinum Stockholder\u2019s nominees, to resign from the Board.\nPlatinum Equity\u2019s interests may not align with the interests of our other security holders. Accordingly, Platinum Equity could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which our stockholders would not approve or make decisions with which they would not agree. Further, Platinum Equity is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Platinum Equity may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In recognition that principals, members, directors, managers, partners, stockholders, officers, employees and other representatives of Platinum Equity and its affiliates and investment funds may serve as our directors or officers, our certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that none of Platinum Equity or any principal, member, director, manager, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or other representative of Platinum Equity has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business that we do. In the event that any of these persons or entities acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for itself and us, we will not have any expectancy in such corporate opportunity, and these persons and entities will not have any duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us and may pursue or acquire such corporate opportunity for themselves or direct such opportunity to another person. We are also party to a corporate advisory services agreement with Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (\u201cAdvisors\u201d), pursuant to which Advisors will provide us with certain transactional and corporate advisory services as mutually agreed between us and Advisors. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if, among other things, attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by Platinum Equity to themselves or their other affiliates.\nWe are required to pay PE Greenlight Holdings, LLC for a significant portion of the tax benefit relating to pre-Business Combination tax attributes of Verra Mobility.\nAt the closing of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with the Platinum Stockholder and the stockholder representative (as may be amended from time to time, the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d). The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to the Platinum Stockholder of 50% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the closing of the Business Combination as a result of the increase in the tax basis of the intangible assets of HTA resulting from the acquisition of HTA by Verra Mobility prior to the Business Combination. We will generally retain the benefit of the remaining 50% of these cash savings.\nUnder certain circumstances (including an election by us, a material breach of our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or certain transactions constituting a change in control or divestiture of the HTA assets under the Tax Receivable Agreement), payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may accelerate, and we may be required to make such payments in a lump sum based on certain valuation assumptions, including that we and our\nsubsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the applicable deductions generated by the intangible assets of HTA.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions will include:\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Board;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that directors may only be removed from the Board for cause;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our Board or our Chief Executive Officer, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that changes or amendments to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws must be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of our Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nOur bylaws include a forum selection clause, which may impact the ability of our stockholders to bring actions against us.\nSubject to certain limitations, our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the federal securities laws of the United States against us, our officers, directors, employees or underwriters. These limitations on the forum in which stockholders may initiate action against us could create costs, inconvenience or otherwise adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to seek legal redress. If a court were to find the forum-selection provisions contained in our bylaws to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving proceedings in forums other than the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States.\nResales of the shares of our securities could depress the market price of our securities.\nPlatinum Equity beneficially owned approximately 14.94% of our Class A Common Stock as of December 31, 2020. All such shares of Class A Common Stock held by Platinum Equity have been registered for resale under\nthe Securities Act. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement that we entered into with Platinum Equity and certain other stockholders in connection with the Business Combination, such stockholders are entitled to make up to six demands, excluding short form demands, that we register shares of our Class A Common Stock held by these parties, in addition to certain \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights such stockholders have.\nWe had approximately 162,268,865 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020. We have registered the 10,864,000 shares of Class A Common Stock that we may issue under the Verra Mobility Corporation 2018 Equity Incentive Plan so that they may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nThere may be a large number of our securities sold in the market in the near future. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of securities intend to sell securities, could reduce the market price of our securities. Such sales of our securities or the perception of such sales may depress the market price of our securities.\nOur only significant asset is our ownership interest in our operating subsidiaries and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations, including our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than our ownership interest in our operating subsidiaries. We depend on our operating subsidiaries for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company, to pay any dividends with respect to our Class A Common Stock, and to satisfy our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The financial condition and operating requirements of our operating subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our operating subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations, including our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe ability of our operating subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries which have been designated as unrestricted pursuant to our ability to do so in certain limited circumstances) to make distributions, loans and other payments to us for the purposes described above and for any other purpose are governed by the terms of the Rollover Credit Agreements, and will be subject to the negative covenants set forth therein. Any loans or other extensions of credit will be subject to the investment covenants under the Rollover Credit Agreements. The \u201cRollover Credit Agreements\u201d means, collectively: (i) the First Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2018, among Greenlight Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation; VM Consolidated, Inc. (formerly known as ATS Consolidated, Inc.), a Delaware corporation; American Traffic Solutions, Inc., a Kansas corporation; and Lasercraft, Inc., a Georgia corporation; the lenders party thereto from time to time; and Bank of America, as the administrative agent and the collateral agent; and (ii) the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2018, among Greenlight Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation; VM Consolidated, Inc., a Delaware corporation; the other Borrowers (for this purpose only, as defined therein) party thereto from time to time; the lenders party thereto from time to time; and Bank of America, as the administrative agent and the collateral agent, in the case of each of the foregoing (i) and (ii), as amended or otherwise modified from time to time.\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTC Pink, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. Our warrants using the trading symbol \u201cVRRMW\u201d were removed from listing by Nasdaq on December 14, 2018, due to an insufficient number of round lot holders following completion of the Business Combination. Those warrants are now quoted on OTC Pink under the symbol \u201cVRRMW.\u201d Accordingly, the liquidity of our warrants may be more limited than if they were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. Our securities holders may be unable to sell their securities unless a market can be sustained.\nRisks Related to Our Vendors\nOur reliance on third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely heavily on third-party providers, including subcontractors, manufacturers, software vendors, software application developers, and utility and network providers, to meet their obligations to us in a timely and high-quality manner. For example, we rely on third parties such as the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, Polk, DMVDesk, CVR and Dealertrack to provide a direct connection to state departments of motor vehicles (and their European equivalents) and other governmental agencies with which we do not have direct relationships for the driver and other information we use in our business. Our ability to offer our solutions would be materially affected if this access was unavailable or materially restricted, or if the price we pay increased significantly. Our Government Solutions business also relies on a number of third-party manufacturers, including camera manufacturers and automated license plate recognition providers, and outsources some engineering, construction, maintenance, printing and mailing, call center, image review and violations processing work. Further, if one or more tolling authorities cancels our accounts, or stops providing transponders and we are unable to obtain transponders through other sources, our Commercial Services business would be affected.\nWe also outsource a meaningful percentage of our software development work to third parties. Some of our agreements with these third parties include termination rights, allowing the third party to terminate the arrangement in certain circumstances. For example, the agreements with our third-party payment processors give them the right to terminate the relationship if we fail to keep credit card chargeback and retrieval rates below certain thresholds. If any of our third-party providers are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us, fail to satisfy our expectations or those of our customers, including those imposed through flow-down provisions in prime contracts, or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us on substantially similar terms, we may be unable to find adequate replacements within a reasonable time frame, on favorable commercial terms or at all, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWhile we perform some due diligence on these third parties and take measures to ensure that they comply with applicable laws and regulations, we do not have an extensive screening or review process and ultimately cannot guarantee our third-party providers will comply with applicable laws, the terms of their agreements or flow-down requirements from our customers. Misconduct or performance deficiencies by any of our third-party providers may be perceived as misconduct or poor performance by us, cause us to fall short on our contractual obligations to our customers or harm our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on communications networks and information systems and any interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely heavily on the satisfactory performance and availability of our information technology infrastructure and systems, including our websites and network infrastructure, to conduct our business. We rely on third-party communications service and system providers to provide technology services and link our systems with our customers\u2019 networks and systems, including a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security. We also rely on third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment providers. A failure or interruption that results in the unavailability of any of our information systems or a major disruption of communications between a system and the customer(s) we serve could disrupt the effective operation of our solutions and otherwise adversely impact our ability to manage our business effectively. We may experience system and service interruptions or disruptions for a variety of reasons, including as the result of network failures, power outages, cyber-attacks, employee errors, software errors, an unusually high volume of transactions, or localized conditions such as fire, explosions or power outages or broader geographic events such as earthquakes, storms, floods, epidemics, strikes, acts of war, civil unrest or terrorist acts. We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to certain service disruptions by investing in redundant or blended circuits, although the redundant or blended circuits may also suffer disruption. Because we are dependent in part on independent third parties for the implementation and maintenance of certain aspects of our systems and because some of the causes of system interruptions may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner, or at all. Any interruption or delay in or cessation of these services and systems could significantly disrupt operations, impact customers, damage our reputation, result in litigation, decrease the overall use and acceptance of our solutions, result in lost data and be costly, time consuming and difficult to remedy, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), which requires, among other things, that companies maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and that management review the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. During fiscal year 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls in the area of user access over certain systems that support our financial reporting process. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement on a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness did not result in any misstatement of our financial statements for any period presented. During fiscal year 2020, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness and management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of SOX. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to conclude in the future that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, and/or we may encounter difficulties in implementing or improving our internal controls, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness or our financial reports, the market price of our securities may be negatively affected, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or Nasdaq.\nCompliance and reporting requirements related to being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, SOX, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. We experience additional costs associated with being a public company, including costs associated with compliance with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of SOX.\nMoreover, the demands on management in operating a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies, are significant. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage us as a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLitigation and other disputes and regulatory investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in litigation and other disputes or regulatory investigations that arise in and outside the ordinary course of business. We expect that the number, frequency and significance of these matters may increase as our business expands and we grow as a company. Disputes and litigation may relate to, among other things, intellectual property, commercial arrangements, negligence and fiduciary duty claims, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including our third-party service providers, antitrust claims, deceptive trade practices, general fraud claims and employment law claims, including compliance with wage and hour regulations. Like other companies that handle sensitive personal and payment information, we also face the possibility of allegations regarding employee fraud or misconduct. In addition to more general litigation, at times we are also a named party in claims made against our customers, including putative class actions challenging the legality and constitutionality of automated photo enforcement and other similar programs of\nour Government Solutions customers and consumer fraud claims brought against our RAC customers alleging faulty disclosures regarding our services.\nAs a public company, we may also be subject to securities class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits. From time to time, we may also be reviewed or investigated by U.S. federal, state, or local regulators or regulators in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate regarding similar and other matters, including tax assessments.\nThese investigations can be commenced at the initiative of the governmental authority or as a result of complaints by private citizens, regardless of whether the complaint has any merit. At times, we are also required to obtain licensing and permitting, including with respect to matters such as general contracting, performance of engineering services, performance of electrical work and performance of private investigative work. Although we carry general liability insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed, whether as a result of a dispute, litigation or governmental investigation, and it may not adequately indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nAny claims against us or investigation into our business and activities, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in significant legal and other expenses, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Class action lawsuits can often be particularly burdensome given the breadth of claims, large potential damages and significant costs of defense. In the case of intellectual property litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes could include the cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use of business processes or technology that is subject to third-party patents or other third-party intellectual property rights. Legal or regulatory matters involving our directors, officers or employees in their individual capacities can also create exposure for us because we may be obligated or may choose to indemnify the affected individuals against liabilities and expenses they incur in connection with such matters. Regulatory investigations, including with respect to proper licensing or permitting, can also lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, the loss of a license or permit or the assertion of private litigation claims. Risks associated with these liabilities are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time, making the amount of any legal reserves related to these legal liabilities difficult to determine and, if a reserve is established, subject to future revision. Future results of operations could be adversely affected if any reserve that we establish for a legal liability is increased or the underlying legal proceeding, investigation or other contingency is resolved for an amount in excess of established reserves. Because litigation and other disputes and regulatory investigations are inherently unpredictable, the results of any of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to keep up with technological developments and changing customer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in dynamic industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service innovation and evolving industry standards. We may be required to implement new technologies or adapt to existing but different technologies from those currently used. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate to keep up with technological developments and changes in third-party technologies, including those of our customers and tolling and issuing authorities, to the extent our integrations are interdependent. As a result, we expect we will need to invest significant resources in research and development, often before knowing whether these investments will eventually be successful. The success of new solutions and enhancements and new features for existing solutions depends on several factors, including adequate testing, timely completion, appropriate introduction and market acceptance. Further, we may be required to make changes due to an inability to secure necessary intellectual property protections or licenses. Our inability to anticipate or timely and successfully develop or acquire new products and services or enhance our existing products and services to keep pace with technological changes and meet evolving customer requirements could decrease demand for our solutions and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to laws and regulations and any changes in those laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to multiple, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the countries, states and localities in which we operate. We are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq, and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. In addition to the laws and regulations discussed elsewhere in these risk factors regarding data privacy, foreign operations and other matters, we are subject to laws regarding transportation safety, consumer protection, procurement, anti-kickback, labor and employment matters, competition and antitrust, intellectual\nproperty, environmental matters, and other trade-related laws and regulations. Certain of our operations are also subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as comparable state and local agencies, including departments of transportation, departments of motor vehicles, professional licensing authorities and offices of inspector general. Our Government Solutions segment is also subject to laws related to the use of automated traffic enforcement, the capture, access and retention of data and matters related to government contracting.\nIn connection with our European expansion, we are subject to laws, regulations and administrative practices addressing many of these and other matters in Europe.\nRecent years have seen a substantial increase in the number of new laws and regulations and the rate of change and enforcement of many of these types of laws and regulations. We cannot predict the nature, scope or impact of future laws, regulatory requirements or similar standards may have on our business, whether implemented through changes to existing laws or the way they are administered or interpreted, or through entirely new regulations. Future laws, regulations, and standards or any changed interpretation or administration of existing laws or regulations could limit the use or adoption of one or more of our solutions or require us to incur additional cost or impact our ability to develop and market new solutions. However, we may not be able to respond in a reasonable or cost-effective manner, or at all. Even if we make what we believe are appropriate changes, there is no certainty those actions will comply.\nAny alleged or actual violations of any law or regulation, change in law or regulation or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, including government or regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, civil and criminal fines and penalties, and negative publicly, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to properly perform under our contracts or otherwise satisfy our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business model depends in large part on our ability to retain existing work and attract new work from existing customers. If a customer is not satisfied with our products, services or solutions or the timeliness or quality of our work, we may incur additional costs to address the problem, the profitability of that contract may be impaired, we may experience payment delays, it could do harm to our reputation and hinder our ability to win new work from prospective customers. Failure to properly transition new customers to our systems or existing customers to our different systems, properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate contract costs could also result in delays and general customer dissatisfaction. Other than our agreements with customers in the RAC industry, many of our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon specified advance notice without cause. Any failure to properly perform under our contracts or meet our customers\u2019 expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and Europe, and our domestic tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we are subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to certain factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nlabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u2022\nprofitability of our products and services, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nimpairment of long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity relating to products and services we offer;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nexpansion to new markets;\n\u2022\nlegislative changes impacting automated safety solutions or RAC toll pricing models;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in commodity prices; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of COVID-19.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, then the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If any of the analysts that may cover us change their recommendation regarding our securities adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our securities would likely decline. If any analyst that may cover us ceases covering us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our securities to decline.", "PERMNO": 16631, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "VRRM"}
