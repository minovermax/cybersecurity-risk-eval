RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we deem currently to be material, and do not represent all of the risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider material may in the future become material and impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the following:\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur performance and the market value of our securities are subject to risks associated with our investments in real estate assets and with trends in the real estate industry.\nOur economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and, consequently the market value of the Company\u2019s securities, are subject to the risk that our properties may not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses or other obligations. A deficiency of this nature would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the quoted trading price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nA downturn in the housing market or decline in general economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations.\nWe believe that new home sales are an important indicator of future demand for our superpad sites, lots and condominium units. Demand for new homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. The prior economic downturn severely affected both the numbers of homes that could be sold in our MPCs and the prices for which homebuilders could sell them. We cannot predict when another economic downturn in the housing market will occur. If there were another economic downturn in the housing market or in general economic conditions, the resulting decline in demand for new homes and condominium units would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur performance may be negatively impacted by our recently announced management transitions, and we will continue to depend on the services and performance of our other senior management and key employees.\nWe recently announced that our Chief Executive Officer, David R. Weinreb, and our President, Grant Herlitz, have stepped down from the Company, effective October 21, 2019. We have appointed Paul Layne as Chief Executive Officer. Our future performance will depend, in part, on the successful transition of Mr. Layne as our new Chief Executive Officer. If we do not successfully manage our CEO transition, it could be viewed negatively by our customers, employees or investors and could have an adverse impact on our business. Our future performance will also continue to depend on the services and contributions of our other senior management and key employees to execute on our Transformation Plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities.\nThe proposed sale of our non-core assets is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all.\nOn October 21, 2019, we announced our intention to sell our non-core assets. There can be no assurance of the terms, timing or structure of any transaction involving such assets, whether we will be able to identify buyers for the assets on favorable terms or at all, or whether any such transaction will take place at all. In addition, any such transaction is subject to risks and uncertainties, including unanticipated developments, regulatory approvals or clearances and uncertainty in the financial markets, that could delay or prevent the completion of any such transaction.\nThe proposed sale of our non-core assets may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.\nExecuting the proposed sale of our non-core assets will require us to incur costs and will require the time and attention of our senior management and key employees, which could distract them from operating our business, disrupt operations and result in the loss of business opportunities, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulty in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the sale and following its completion, which could harm our business. Even if the proposed sale is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the sale, and the sale may in fact adversely affect our business.\nWe may experience unexpected difficulties and incur unexpected costs in the relocation of our headquarters from Dallas, Texas to The Woodlands, Texas\nAs part of our Transformation Plan, we announced that we would relocate our headquarters from Dallas, Texas to The Woodlands, Texas. There is a possibility that some members of senior management and key employees will decide to leave the Company instead of moving to The Woodlands. The loss of services of members of senior management or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the relocation of our headquarters is a major undertaking and actual costs related to the relocation, including the costs to backfill members of senior management or key employees who choose not to relocate, may exceed our estimates.\nOur MPC segment is highly dependent on homebuilders.\nWe are highly dependent on our relationships with homebuilders to purchase superpad sites and lots at our MPCs. Our business will be adversely affected if homebuilders do not view our MPCs as desirable locations for homebuilding operations or due to a change in demand, our inability to achieve certain pricing arrangements or upon an overall decline in general market conditions. Also, some homebuilders may be unwilling or unable to close on previously committed lot purchases due to our failure to meet certain conditions in our agreements or otherwise. As a result, we may sell fewer lots and, in certain instances suspend any of our MPC developments. This would result in lower land sales revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur development, construction and sale of condominiums are subject to state regulations and may be subject to claims from the condominium owner\u2019s association at each project.\nA portion of our business is dedicated to the development and sale of condominiums. Condominiums are generally regulated by an agency of the state in which they are located or where the condominiums are marketed to be sold. In connection with our development and offering of condominium units for sale, we must submit regulatory filings to various state agencies and engage in an entitlement process by which real property owned under one title is converted into individual units. Responses or comments on our condominium filings may delay our ability to sell condominiums in certain states and other jurisdictions in a timely manner, or at all. Further, we will be required to transfer control of a condominium association\u2019s board of directors once we trigger one of several statutory thresholds, with the most likely triggers being tied to the sale of not less than a majority of units to third-party owners. Transfer of control can result in claims with respect to deficiencies in operating funds and reserves, construction defects and other condominium-related matters by the condominium association and/or third-party condominium unit owners. Any material claims in these areas could negatively affect our reputation in condominium development and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur condominium sales are sensitive to interest rates and the ability of consumers to obtain mortgage financing.\nThe ability of the ultimate buyers of condominiums to finance their purchases is generally dependent on their personal savings and availability of third-party financing. Consequently, the demand for condominiums will be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, unavailability of mortgage financing, increasing housing costs and unemployment levels. Levels of income and savings, including retirement savings, available to condominium purchasers can be affected by declines in the capital markets. Any significant increase in the mortgage interest rates or decrease in available credit could reduce consumer demand for housing, and result in fewer condominium sales, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPurchasers may default on their obligations to purchase condominiums.\nWe enter into contracts for the sale of condominium units that generally provide for the payment of a substantial portion of the sales price at closing when a condominium unit is ready to be delivered and occupied. A significant amount of time may pass between the execution of a contract for the purchase of a condominium unit and the closing thereof. Defaults by purchasers to pay any remaining portions of the sales prices for condominium units under contract may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDownturn in tenants\u2019 businesses may reduce our revenues and cash flows.\nAn office or retail tenant may experience a downturn in its business, which may weaken its financial condition and result in its failure to make timely rental payments or result in defaults under our leases. In the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment.\nWe may be negatively impacted by the consolidation or closing of anchor stores.\nMany of our mixed-used properties are anchored by \u201cbig box\u201d tenants. We could be adversely affected if these or other anchor stores were to consolidate, close or enter into bankruptcy. Given the current economic environment for certain retailers, there is a heightened risk an anchor store could close or enter into bankruptcy. Any losses resulting from the bankruptcy of any of our existing tenants could adversely impact our financial condition. Even if we own the anchor space, we may be unable to re-lease this area or to re-lease it on comparable terms. The loss of these revenues could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Further, the temporary or permanent loss of any anchor would likely reduce customer traffic in the retail center, which could lead to decreased sales at other retail stores. Rents obtained from other tenants may be adversely impacted as a result of co-tenancy\nclauses in their leases. One or more of these factors could cause the retail center to fail to meet its debt service requirements. The consolidation of anchor stores may also negatively affect lease negotiations and current and future development projects.\nSeaport District Operational Risk\nThe Seaport District\u2019s operational results are volatile. The increased volatility is largely the result of: (i) seasonality; (ii) potential sponsorship revenue; (iii) potential event revenue; and (iv) business operating risks from various start-up businesses. We own, either wholly or through joint ventures, and in some instances operate, several start-up businesses in the Seaport District. As a result, the revenues and expenses of these businesses directly impact the net operating income of the Seaport District, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. This is in contrast to our other retail properties where we generally receive lease payments from unaffiliated tenants and are not necessarily impacted by the operating performance of their underlying businesses.\nWe may be unable to renew leases or re-lease available space.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that existing leases will be renewed, available space will be re-leased or that our rental rates will be equal to or above the current rental rates. If the average rental rates for our properties decrease, existing tenants do not renew their leases, or available space is not re-leased, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the quoted trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations at the affected properties could be adversely affected.\nWe may have to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our hotel properties, and any hotel redevelopment or development activities we undertake may be more costly than we anticipate.\nFrom time to time, our hotels will have a need for renovations and other capital improvements, including replacements of furniture, fixtures and equipment. Managers or franchisors of our hotels also require periodic capital improvements pursuant to management agreements we enter into with them or as a condition of maintaining franchise licenses. Generally, we are responsible for the cost of these capital improvements. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we may also develop hotel properties, timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties, including the development of retail, office or apartments, including through joint ventures. Such renovation and development involves substantial risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe disruption of operations and displacement of revenue at operating hotels, including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants or meeting space under renovation are out of service;\n\u2022\nthe cost of funding renovations or developments and inability to obtain financing on attractive terms;\n\u2022\nthe return on our investment in these capital improvements or developments failing to meet expectations;\n\u2022\ngovernmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project or the inability to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and construction permits; and\n\u2022\ndisputes with franchisors or property managers regarding compliance with relevant franchise agreements or management agreements.\nThe occurrence of any of the aforementioned risks or any others not currently known to us could negatively impact certain hotel properties and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe concentration of our properties in certain states may make our revenues and the value of our assets vulnerable to adverse changes in local economic conditions.\nMany of the properties we own are located in the same or a limited number of geographic regions, including Texas, Hawai\u2018i, Nevada, New York and Maryland. Our operations at the properties in these states are generally subject to significant fluctuations by various factors that are beyond our control such as the regional and local economy, which may be negatively impacted by material relocation by residents, industry slowdowns, plant closings, increased unemployment, lack of availability of consumer credit, levels of consumer debt, housing market conditions, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors, as well as the local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, hotel rooms and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants.\nIn addition, some of our properties are subject to various other factors specific to those geographic areas. For example, tourism is a major component of both the local economies in Hawai\u2018i and Nevada. Ward Village, which is located in Honolulu, Hawai\u2018i, and Summerlin, which is located in Las Vegas, Nevada, may be impacted by the local and global tourism industry. These properties are susceptible to any factors that affect travel and tourism related to Hawai\u2018i and Las Vegas, including cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from these regions. Moreover, these properties may be affected by risks such as acts of terrorism and natural disasters, including major fires, floods and earthquakes, as well as severe or inclement weather, which could also decrease tourism activity in Las Vegas or Hawai\u2018i.\nFurther, Summerlin is to some degree dependent on the gaming industry, which could be adversely affected by changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we have no control. The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery, sweepstakes and poker machines, many of which are located outside of Las Vegas. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could negatively impact the population in the Las Vegas area. Expansion of internet gaming in other jurisdictions (both legal and illegal) could further compete with the gaming industry in Las Vegas, which could have a negative impact on the local Las Vegas economy and result in an adverse effect on Summerlin and Downtown Summerlin.\nMarkets and the local economy surrounding our properties in Columbia, Maryland are heavily influenced by government spending and activity. A reduction of government spending in this market generally could decrease the demand for housing and retail space in this geographic region.\nThe Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland in the Houston, Texas region depend significantly on the energy sector. Our success depends to a large extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, employment trends and real estate activity in and around Houston, Texas. In the event that oil prices fall and remain depressed for a sustained period, demand may decrease for housing and commercial space in The Woodlands, Bridgeland and The Woodlands Hills and hotel rooms at our hospitality properties in The Woodlands.\nIf any or all of the factors discussed above were to occur and result in our inability to sell or lease our residential and commercial property, or book an adequate amount of hotel room stays at our hospitality properties, in any of these geographic regions, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the development, redevelopment or construction of our properties.\nOur development, redevelopment and construction activities expose us to risks such as:\n\u2022\ninability to obtain construction financing for the development or redevelopment of properties;\n\u2022\nincreased construction costs for a project that exceeded our original estimates due to increases in materials, labor or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents or condominium prices may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increased construction costs;\n\u2022\nconstruction delays, which may increase project development costs;\n\u2022\nclaims for construction defects after a property has been developed;\n\u2022\npoor performance or nonperformance by any of our joint venture partners or other third parties on whom we rely;\n\u2022\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u2022\neasement restrictions which may impact our development costs and timing;\n\u2022\ncompliance with building codes and other local regulations; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to secure tenants necessary to support commercial projects.\nIf any of the aforementioned risks were to occur during the development, redevelopment or construction of our properties, it could have a substantial negative impact on the project\u2019s success and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nDevelopment of properties entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly entitlement process.\nApproval to develop real property sometimes requires political support and generally entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requires discretionary action by local governments. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. We incur substantial costs to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. An increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that the property is not feasible for development. In addition, our competitors and local residents may challenge our efforts to obtain entitlements and permits for the development of properties. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our development activities.\nSpecifically, our redevelopment plans for the Seaport District are subject to a Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (\u201cULURP\u201d) that requires approval by the New York City Council, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and various other government agencies. Our inability to obtain or modify the ULURP could negatively affect our future redevelopment plans for the Seaport District.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of the development of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our homebuilding or other activities.\nVarious local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the real estate development industry. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state and local policies, rules and regulations and their interpretations and application.\nMunicipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. If municipalities in which we operate take such actions, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. These measures may reduce our ability to open new MPCs and to build and sell other real estate development projects in the affected markets, including with respect to land we may already own, and create additional costs and administration requirements, which in turn may harm our future sales, margins and earnings.\nIn addition, there is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. Such environmental laws may affect, for example, how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. In addition, it is possible that some form of expanded energy efficiency legislation may be passed by the U.S. Congress or federal agencies and certain state legislatures, which may, despite being phased in over time, significantly increase our costs of building MPCs and the sale price to our buyers and adversely affect our sales volumes. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law.\nEnergy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy related taxes and regulations. Our noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations and other sanctions.\nGovernmental regulation affects not only construction activities but also sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\nOur development projects may subject us to certain liabilities.\nWe may hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction, engineering and various other services for wholly-owned development projects or development projects undertaken by real estate ventures in which we hold an equity interest. Certain of these contracts are structured such that we are the principal rather than the agent. As a result, we may assume liabilities in the course of the project and be subjected to, or become liable for, claims for construction defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions by third parties we have engaged.\nAdverse outcomes of disputes or litigation could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly if we have not limited the extent of the damages to which we may be liable, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance that we carry. Moreover, our tenants and condominium owners may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a legal matter, in which case we may determine it necessary to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the tenant or customer relationship or to protect our corporate brand. Acting as a principal may also mean that we pay a contractor before we have been reimbursed by our tenants or have received the entire purchase price of a condominium unit from the purchaser. This exposes us to additional risks of collection in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or a condominium purchaser default. The reverse can occur as well, where a contractor we have paid files for bankruptcy protection or commits fraud with the funds before completing a project which we have funded in part or in full.\nFor example, we are directly paying the costs to repair certain defects at the Waiea condominium tower in Ward Village and will seek to recoup these costs from the general contractor and other responsible parties. In 2018, we recognized a $13.4 million charge for certain window repairs at Waiea, and we currently are in settlement discussions with the Waiea homeowners association, which could result in us agreeing to fund the repair cost for certain other alleged construction defects at Waiea. If we do agree to fund these repair costs, we expect to fully recover these costs from the general contractor or the other responsible parties.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes and the Loans.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our total consolidated debt was approximately $4.1 billion (excluding an undrawn balance of $120.0 million under our revolving facilities) of which $1.6 billion was recourse to the Company. In addition, we have $184.2 million of recourse guarantees associated with undrawn construction financing commitments as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our proportionate share of the debt of our non-consolidated joint ventures (\u201cReal estate and other affiliates\u201d) was $100.3 million based upon our economic ownership. All of the debt of our real estate and other affiliates is non-recourse to us.\nSubject to the limits contained in the indenture governing the $1,000,000,000 5.375% senior notes due 2025 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), the limits contained in the Loan Agreements (as defined below) which mature on September 18, 2023 and any limits under our other debt agreements, we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time, including project indebtedness for developments by our subsidiaries. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify. Specifically, an increased level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Loan Agreements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or finance other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to make non-strategic divestitures, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited, which may adversely impact sales prices;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be allocated to debt service payments instead of other business purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given that certain indebtedness bears interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities, reinvest in and develop properties, and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulations;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which default could result in all or part of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of our secured debt, could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes contains, and our other debt agreements contain, restrictions which may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes contains, and some of our other debt agreements contain, certain restrictions. These restrictions limit our ability or the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness or issue certain equity;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur obligations that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend or other payments to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ncreate or designate unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAdditionally, certain of our debt agreements also contain various restrictive covenants, including minimum net worth requirements, maximum payout ratios on distributions, minimum debt yield ratios, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum interest coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios.\nThe restrictions under the indenture and/or other debt agreements could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities.\nWe may be required to take action to reduce our debt or act in a manner inconsistent with our business objectives and strategies to meet such ratios and satisfy the covenants in our debt agreements. Events beyond our control, including changes in economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to do so. We may not be able to meet the ratios or satisfy the covenants in our debt agreements, and we cannot assure that our lenders will waive any failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios, under our debt agreements would likely result in a default under such debt agreements, which may accelerate the principal and interest payments of the debt and, if such debt is secured, result in the foreclosure on certain of our assets that secure such debt. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios, under our debt agreements also would prevent us from borrowing additional money under such agreements that include revolving credit facilities. A default under any of our debt agreements could, in turn, result in defaults under other obligations and result in other creditors accelerating the payment of other obligations and foreclosing on assets securing such obligations, if any.\nAny such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if the lenders under any of our debt agreements or other obligations accelerate the maturity of those obligations, we cannot assure that we will have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the notes or our other debt.\nThe Loan Agreements governing our $615,000,000 Term Loan and $85,000,000 Revolver Loan contain restrictions which may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe loan agreements governing our Term Loan and Revolver loan (the \u201cLoan Agreements\u201d) contain representations and covenants which are customary for a loan agreement of this type, including financial covenants related to maintenance of interest coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios with respect to the certain mortgaged properties, taken as a whole. The Loan Agreements also contain customary events of default, certain of which are subject to cure periods. These restrictions limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur further indebtedness\n\u2022\ndistribute cash generated from borrowers if financial coverage ratios or other covenants are not met\n\u2022\nenter into or amend lease or other agreements or transactions without lender consent\n\u2022\nsubstitute collateral due to product and geographic concentrations\nThe restrictions under the Loan Agreements could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities.\nWe may be required to take action to reduce our debt or act in a manner inconsistent with our business objectives and strategies to meet such ratios and satisfy the covenants in our Loan Agreements. Events beyond our control, including changes in economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to do so. We may not be able to meet the ratios\nor satisfy the covenants in our Loan Agreements, and we cannot assure you that our lenders will waive any failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios, under our Loan Agreements would likely result in a default under such debt agreements, which may accelerate the principal and interest payments of the debt and, if such debt is secured, result in the foreclosure on certain of our assets that secure such debt. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios, under our Loan Agreements also would prevent us from borrowing additional money under such agreements that include revolving credit facilities. A default under any of our Loan Agreements could, in turn, result in defaults under other obligations and result in other creditors accelerating the payment of other obligations and foreclosing on assets securing such obligations, if any.\nAny such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if the lenders under any of our debt agreements or other obligations accelerate the maturity of those obligations, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the notes or our other debt.\nWe may be unable to develop and expand our properties without sufficient capital or financing.\nOur business objective includes the development and redevelopment of our properties, particularly those in our Strategic Developments segment, which we may be unable to do if we do not have, cannot obtain or cannot generate sufficient capital from MPC land sales or operations, debt capital from lenders or the capital markets, or government incentives, such as tax increment financing, to proceed with planned development, redevelopment or expansion activities. We may be unable to obtain an anchor store, mortgage lender and property partner approvals that are required for any such development, redevelopment or expansion. We may abandon redevelopment or expansion activities already underway that we are unable to complete due to the inability to secure additional capital to finance such activities. This may result in charge-offs of costs previously capitalized. In addition, if redevelopment, expansion or reinvestment projects are unsuccessful, the investment in such projects may not be recoverable, in full or in part, from future operations or sale resulting in impairment charges.\nOur business model includes entering into joint venture arrangements with strategic partners and our strategic partners may have different interests than us.\nWe currently have and intend to enter into joint venture partnerships. These joint venture partners may bring local market knowledge and relationships, development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive advantages. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources, experience and/or skills to locate desirable partners. We also may not be able to attract partners who want to conduct business in the locations where our properties are located, and who have the assets, reputation or other characteristics that would optimize our development opportunities.\nWhile we generally participate in making decisions for our jointly owned properties and assets, we might not always have the same objectives as the partner in relation to a particular asset, and we might not be able to formally resolve any issues that arise. In addition, actions by a partner may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the joint venture agreements, be contrary to our instructions or requests or result in adverse consequences. We cannot control the ultimate outcome of any decision made, which may be detrimental to our interests.\nThe bankruptcy or, to a lesser extent, financial distress of any of our joint venture partners could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties. If this occurred, we would be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. At a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. If the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other partners might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.2 billion of mortgages, notes and loans payable indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In July 2017, the United Kingdom regulator that regulates LIBOR announced its intention to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has proposed replacing USD-LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements - the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such developments and\nany other legal or regulatory changes in the method by which LIBOR is determined or the transition from LIBOR to a successor benchmark may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, and changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR, which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in LIBOR\u2019s determination and, in certain situations, could result in LIBOR no longer being determined and published. If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable after 2021, the interest rates on our mortgage notes, which is indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods, any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if U.S. dollar LIBOR was available in its current form. Further, the same costs and risks that may lead to the unavailability of U.S. dollar LIBOR may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine. Any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, and as a result, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nSignificant competition could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe nature and extent of the competition we face depends on the type of property. With respect to our MPCs, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers in the development of properties within the Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston, Texas; and Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. markets. A number of residential and commercial developers, some with greater financial and other resources, compete with us in seeking resources for development and prospective purchasers and tenants. Competition from other real estate developers may adversely affect our ability to attract purchasers and sell residential and commercial real estate, sell undeveloped rural land, attract and retain experienced real estate development personnel, or obtain construction materials and labor. These competitive conditions can make it difficult to sell land at desirable prices and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our operating retail properties in attracting retailers to lease space. In addition, retailers at these properties face continued competition from other retailers, including internet retailers, retailers at other regional shopping centers, outlet malls and other discount shopping centers, discount shopping clubs, and catalog companies. Competition of this type could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment and development opportunities. These competitors include REITs and private institutional investors.\nWe are subject to risks associated with hedging arrangements.\nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including caps and cash settled forward starting swaps, to mitigate or reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility or to satisfy lender requirements. These agreements expose us to additional risks, including a risk that counterparties of these hedging and swap agreements will not perform. There also could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under a hedging agreement. In addition, our hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on interest rate exposure and have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the value of our tax assets.\nCertain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code could limit our ability to fully utilize certain tax assets if we were to experience a \u201cchange of control.\u201d If such an event were to occur, the cash flow benefits we might otherwise have received would be eliminated. For example, we currently have approximately $457.6 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, $25.0 million of which are subject to the separate return year limitation rules.\nThe effect of comprehensive United States tax reform legislation on the Company and its affiliates, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain.\nChanges to United States federal income tax rules and regulations could have material United States federal income tax consequences for the Company or an investment in the Company. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) that significantly changes the United States federal income tax system. Among a number of significant changes to the current United States federal income tax rules, the Tax Act reduces the marginal United States corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax, limits the deduction for net business interest expense and compensation expense above $1.0 million, shifts the United States toward a more territorial tax system, and imposes new taxes to combat erosion of the United States federal income tax base. The effect of the Tax Act on us, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. We will continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the impact that the Tax Act as a whole will have on us.\nBecause real estate is illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when in our best interest.\nReal estate investments generally, and in particular large office and mixed-use properties like those that we develop and construct, often cannot be sold quickly. The capitalization rates at which properties may be sold could be higher than historic rates, thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale. Consequently, we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. All of these factors reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on demand for homes in our MPCs and demand for our condominium projects, and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. In an inflationary environment, depending on the homebuilding industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising land prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which could significantly reduce our profit margins. In recent years we have been experiencing increases in the prices of labor and materials above the general inflation rate. Our inability to recover increasing costs due to inflation through price increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nSome of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.\nA number of our properties are located in areas which are subject to natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and oil spills. We cannot predict the extent of damage that may result from such adverse weather events, which depend on a variety of factors beyond our control. Some of our properties, including Houston-area MPCs, Ward Village, the Seaport District and the Outlet Collection at Riverwalk are located in coastal regions, and could be affected by increases in sea levels, the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms, or environmental disasters, whether such events are caused by global climate changes or other factors. Additionally, adverse weather events can cause widespread property damage and significantly depress the local economies in which the Company operates and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operations.\nClimate change may adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of climate change, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nSome potential losses are not insured.\nWe carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. If this happens, we might remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.\nLoss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe depend on the efforts of key executive personnel. The loss of the services of any key executive personnel could adversely affect our business and operations. While we believe we have proper succession planning and are confident we could attract and train new personnel if necessary, this could impose additional costs and hinder our business strategy. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.\nA breach of the Company\u2019s privacy or information security systems, or those of our vendors or other third parties, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nThe protection of tenant, business partner, employee and company data is critically important to us. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our\ntenants and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees on our networks. The collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations. Privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to market the Company\u2019s properties and services.\nThe security measures that we and our vendors put in place cannot provide absolute security, and the information technology infrastructure we and our vendors use may be vulnerable to criminal cyber-attacks or data security incidents, including, ransom of data, such as, without limitation, tenant, business partner and/or employee information, due to employee error, malfeasance or other vulnerabilities. Any such incident could compromise our networks or our vendors\u2019 networks (or the networks or systems of third parties that facilitate our business activities or our vendors\u2019 business activities), and the information we or our vendors store could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost or stolen, resulting in fraud, including wire fraud related to our assets, or other harm. Moreover, if a data security incident or breach affects our systems or our vendors\u2019 systems, whether through a breach of our systems or a breach of the systems of third parties, or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, including, without limitation, loss related to the fact that agreements with our vendors, or our vendors\u2019 financial condition, may not allow us to recover all costs related to a cyber-breach for which they alone are responsible for or which we are jointly responsible for, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPrivacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as ransomware, and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. In light of the increased risks, we have dedicated substantial additional resources of expense, labor and time to strengthening the security of our computer systems. In the future, we may expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Despite these steps, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a significant data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on our systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. Any failure in or breach of our information security systems, those of third party service providers or a breach of other third party systems that ultimately impacts our operational or information security systems as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business and results of operations. Further, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as phishing and other forms of human engineering, are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change frequently; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.\nPossible terrorist activity or other acts of violence could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture terrorist attacks in the United States or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult to renew or re-lease properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties, including a high-profile property such as the Seaport District, through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be lower or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that tenants are affected by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. These acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. Any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of new or redeveloped properties, and limit access to capital or increase the cost of capital.\nWe may be subject to potential costs to comply with environmental laws.\nFuture development opportunities may require additional capital and other expenditures to comply with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner\u2019s ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments, and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with our ownership, operation and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or tanks or related claims.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty the magnitude of any expenditures relating to the environmental compliance or the long-range effect, if any, on our operations. Compliance with such laws has not had a material adverse effect on our operating results or competitive position in the past but could have such an effect on our operating results and competitive position in the future.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act may be a significant cost for us.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (\u201cADA\u201d), requires that all public accommodations and commercial facilities, including office buildings, meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with ADA requirements could involve the removal of structural barriers from certain disabled persons\u2019 entrances which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other federal, state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such accesses. Noncompliance with the ADA or similar or related laws or regulations could result in the United States government imposing fines or private litigants being awarded damages against us. In addition, changes to existing requirements or enactments of new requirements could require significant expenditures. Such costs may adversely affect our business, financial and results of operations.\nSome of our directors are involved in other businesses including real estate activities and public and/or private investments and, therefore, may have competing or conflicting interests with us.\nCertain of our directors have and may in the future have interests in other real estate business activities and may have control or influence over these activities or may serve as investment advisors, directors or officers. These interests and activities, and any duties to third parties arising from such interests and activities, could divert the attention of such directors from our operations. Additionally, certain of our directors are engaged in investment and other activities in which they may learn of real estate and other related opportunities in their non-director capacities. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors expressly provides, as permitted by Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), that our non-employee directors are not obligated to limit their interests or activities in their non-director capacities or to notify us of any opportunities that may arise in connection therewith, even if the opportunities are complementary to, or in competition with, our businesses. Accordingly, we have no expectation that we will be able to learn of or participate in such opportunities. If any potential business opportunity is expressly presented to a director exclusively in his or her director capacity, the director will not be permitted to pursue the opportunity, directly or indirectly through a controlled affiliate in which the director has an ownership interest, without the approval of the independent members of our board of directors.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile due to the stock market\u2019s routine periods of large or extreme volatility. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies, including ours. Factors that affect our trading price include the following:\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, including our ability to finance and achieve operational success at the Seaport District project;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally, particularly those in the real estate industry;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new significant real-estate developments, acquisitions, joint ventures, other strategic relationships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions, including increases in interest rates, or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in business or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe successful transition of our new Chief Executive Officer and the services and contribution of our other senior management and key employees to execute on our Transformation Plan and to identify new opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe sale of our non-core assets;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to litigation;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance, or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nevents or factors resulting from natural disasters, such as the impact of Hurricane Harvey in the Houston, Texas area; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, acts of terrorism, or responses to these events.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, Delaware law, stockholder\u2019s rights agreement and certain other agreements may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following limitations:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting without 15% or more of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\na requirement that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, certain proceedings against or involving us or our directors or officers be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware; and\n\u2022\nthat certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nIn addition, we are a Delaware corporation, and Section 203 of the DGCL applies to us. In general, Section 203 prevents an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d from engaging in certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with us for three years following the date that person becomes an interested stockholder subject to certain exceptions. The statute generally defines \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d as any person that is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock or is our affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination.\nWe have granted a waiver of the applicability of the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL to Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., PS Management GP, LLC and William A. Ackman, chairman of our Board (together, \u201cPershing Square\u201d) such that Pershing Square may increase its position in our common stock up to 26% of the outstanding shares without being subject to Section 203\u2019s restrictions on business combinations. As such, Pershing Square, through its ability to accumulate more common stock than would otherwise be permitted under Section 203, has the ability to become a large holder that would be able to affect matters requiring approval by Company stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The Board also amended the Company\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines to reflect that it will grant to any\nstockholder a waiver of the applicability of Section 203 of the DGCL to the acquisition of up to 26% of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock upon the request of such stockholder, subject to the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties and applicable law.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. There also may be dilution of our common stock from the exercise of outstanding warrants, which may materially adversely affect the market price and negatively impact a holder\u2019s investment.", "PERMNO": 12373, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "HHC"}
