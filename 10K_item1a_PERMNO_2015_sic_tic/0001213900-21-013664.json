{"cik": "1494891", "company": "Sensus Healthcare, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in Sensus\u2019 common stock contains a high degree of risk. An investor should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision. Sensus\u2019 business could be harmed if any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known or deem immaterial, could materialize. The trading price of Sensus\u2019 common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\nRisks Related to our Business\nIf third-party payors do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the use of our products, it is unlikely that our products will be widely used, and our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nIn the U.S., the commercial success of Sensus\u2019 existing products and any future products will depend, in part, on the extent to which governmental payors at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for procedures using these products. Neither hospitals nor physicians are likely to use Sensus\u2019 products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement payments for the procedures using these products.\nSome private payors in the U.S. may base their reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions determined by the Center of Medicare and Medical Services, or CMS, which administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer the Medicaid program. Others may adopt different coverage or reimbursement policies for procedures performed using Sensus\u2019 products, while some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, have reimbursement policies that vary from state to state, some of which may not pay an amount that supports the selling price of Sensus\u2019 products, if at all. A Medicare national or local coverage decision denying coverage for any of the procedures performed using the Company\u2019s products could result in private and other third-party payors also denying coverage. Medicare (Part B) and a number of private insurers in the U.S. currently cover and pay for both non-melanoma skin cancer and keloid treatments using the SRT-100. A withdrawal, or even contemplation of a withdrawal, by CMS, Medicaid or private payors of reimbursements, or any other unfavorable coverage or reimbursement decisions by government programs or private payors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nReimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be cleared for sale in that country. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. Sensus\u2019 products may not be considered cost-effective by international third-party payors or governments managing healthcare systems. Furthermore, reimbursement may not be available or, if available, third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell products profitably. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement are not available for Sensus\u2019 products, in either the U.S. or internationally, the demand for these products and, consequently, the Company\u2019s revenues will be adversely affected.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health epidemics, including COVID-19, that are beyond our control.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases, public health epidemics and other adverse public health developments in countries where we, our customers, or our suppliers operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our sales as social distancing and related concerns forced physicians to temporarily close their practices in 2020 and is expected to continue to adversely impact our business, and the nature and extent of the impact is highly uncertain and beyond our control. Uncertain factors relating to COVID-19 include the duration, spread and severity of the virus, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, vendors and suppliers, and the actions or perception of actions that may be taken to contain or treat its impact, including declarations of states of emergency, business closures, manufacturing restrictions and a prolonged period of travel, commercial and/or other similar restrictions and limitations.\nAs a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain its spread, our sales have been, and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. If our suppliers\u2019 operations are impacted, we may need to seek alternate suppliers, which may be more expensive, may not be available, or may result in delays in shipments to us and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. The duration of the related financial impact to us, cannot be estimated at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our essential employees who are unable to telework become ill or otherwise incapacitated, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nConsistent with rapidly changing federal, state and local governmental orders and recommendations, we have implemented informal telework policies for appropriate categories of our employees. Employees that are unable to telework continue to work at our facilities, and we have implemented appropriate safety measures, including social distancing, face covering mandates, temperature checking, and increased sanitation standards in an attempt to maintain the health and safety of our workforce. We are following guidance from the Center for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) regarding suspension of nonessential travel, self-isolation recommendations for employees returning from certain geographic areas, confirmed reports of any COVID-19 diagnosis among our employees, and the return of such employees to our workplace. Pursuant to updated guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, we are engaging in limited and appropriate inquiries of employees regarding potential COVID-19 exposure, based on the direct threat that such exposure may present to our workforce. We continue to address other unique situations that arise among our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic on a case-by-case basis. While we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to ensure the health and wellbeing of our employees, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to COVID-19 outside of our workplace. If a number of our essential employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable to continue working during the current or any future epidemic, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nSubstantially all of Sensus\u2019 revenue is generated from the sale of the SRT-100 and related products, and any decline in the sales of these products or failure to gain market acceptance of these products will negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is focused heavily on the development and commercialization of a limited number of products for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions with superficial radiotherapy. From the Company\u2019s inception in 2010 through December 31, 2020, revenue has primarily been derived from sales of the SRT-100 product line and related services and ancillary products. Although Sensus has introduced new products, the Company expects most of revenue in 2021 to be derived from or related to sales of the SRT-100 product line.\nSensus has a single preferred supplier for the x-ray tubes and other major components used in the Company\u2019s products and the loss of this preferred supplier could adversely affect the Company.\nSensus has a single preferred supplier for the x-ray tubes and other major components used in the Company\u2019s products. Although other suppliers exist in the market, the Company believes that our preferred supplier\u2019s products are of a superior quality. The loss of the preferred supplier, or the inability to supply the Company or third party manufacturer with adequate components could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to effectively produce the Company\u2019s products to meet existing demand levels, especially if Sensus were unable to timely procure them from other suppliers in the market, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize products and increase revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s customers are concentrated in the U.S. and China (including one U.S. customer accounting for a significant portion of our sales), and economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies or patterns of the Company\u2019s customers in these countries could have a significant impact on future business and operating results.\nMost of the Company\u2019s sales have been made to customers located in the U.S. (91% and 93% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively). For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 9% and 3%, respectively, of product sales were to Chinese customers and approximately 0% and 4%, respectively, were to Israeli customers. Additionally, a single customer in the U.S. accounted for approximately 39% and 68% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because of these geographic and customer concentrations, revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, competitive products, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with, these countries or this customer. A reduction or delay in orders for the Company\u2019s products from these countries and this customer could materially harm business and results of operations, including any adverse impact of the coronavirus epidemic\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may negatively impact the value of its securities.\nQuarterly revenues and results of operations may fluctuate due to the following reasons, among others:\n\u25cf physician and hospital acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf the timing, expense and results of research and development activities, and obtaining future regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf fluctuations in expenses associated with expanding operations;\n\u25cf the introduction of new products and technologies by competitors;\n\u25cf sales representatives\u2019 productivity;\n\u25cf supplier, manufacturing or quality problems with products;\n\u25cf the timing of stocking orders from distributors;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of competitors or suppliers; and\n\u25cf changes in third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies.\nBecause of these and other related or similar factors, it is likely that in some future period the Company\u2019s operating results will not meet expectations. Failure to meet or exceed analyst expectations could cause a decrease in the trading price of the Sensus\u2019 securities.\nSensus may be required to obtain additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nSensus\u2019 operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. Sensus may need to seek additional capital, as the existing financial resources including our existing revolving line of credit, may not allow the Company to conduct all of the activities that would be beneficial for future growth.\nThe Company may need to seek funds in the future. The Company\u2019s existing revolving line of credit restricts the ability to incur certain indebtedness or permit certain encumbrances on assets without the prior written consent of the lender. If Sensus is unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, the Company may not be able to support commercialization efforts, increase research and development activities, meet debt and other contractual obligations, and the growth of business may be negatively impacted. As a result, Sensus may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe Company\u2019s cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from current estimates and depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the results of commercialization efforts for products;\n\u25cf the need for additional capital to fund development programs;\n\u25cf the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property;\n\u25cf the establishment of high-volume manufacturing and increased sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; and\n\u25cf success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties.\nTo the extent that Sensus raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of the existing stockholders will be diluted. Moreover, the terms of newly issued securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect common stockholders\u2019 rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring distributions or dividends. If Sensus raises additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, the Company may have to relinquish valuable rights to technologies, products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable. Any of these events could adversely affect the ability to declare dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and to achieve future product development and commercialization goals and have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future revenues and operating income.\nThe medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater market presence. Health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for the combined companies. As a result, the disruption in the healthcare industry caused by consolidation may lead to further competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future revenues and operating income.\nRisks Related to our Regulatory Environment\nSensus is subject to various federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nSensus\u2019 operations are, and will continue to be, directly and indirectly affected by various federal, state and foreign healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, those described below.\n\u25cf Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S. Code \u00a71320a-7b), which prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce the referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the referring, ordering, purchasing or leasing of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\u25cf Federal \u201cSunshine\u201d (42 U.S. Code \u00a71320a-7h) law, which requires us to track and report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians, and their immediate family members. We are also subject to similar foreign \u201csunshine\u201d laws or codes of conduct, which vary country by country.\n\u25cf Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false records or statements to obtain payment from, or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act (31 U.S. Code \u00a73729-3733), it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Many of the physicians that use our products will file for reimbursement from governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. As a result, we may be subject to the False Claims Act if we knowingly \u201ccause\u201d the filing of false claims.\n\u25cf Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, statute, which, among other things, created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nAdditionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and applicable implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on entities subject to the law, such as health plans, clearinghouses, and healthcare providers and their business associates. Internationally, substantially every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we must comply, including the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and national implementation of the Directive in the member states of the European Union.\nMany states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with healthcare professionals and entities, and require the Company to track and report payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees, provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. Additionally, certain states require a certificate of need prior to the installation of a radiation device, such as the SRT-100. Sensus is also subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country.\nIf the Company\u2019s operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply now or in the future, Sensus may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business and financial results.\nSensus is required to comply with medical device reporting requirements and must report certain malfunctions, deaths, and serious injuries associated with its products, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the U.S. Food and Drug Administration medical device reporting regulations (21 CFR 803), medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the European Economic Area are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell (MEDDEV 2.12-1) to the Competent Authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred through the European Vigilance process.\nIf an event subject to medical device reporting requirements occurs, Sensus will need to comply with the reporting requirements, which would adversely affect its reputation and subject the Company to actions by regulatory authorities, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Furthermore, any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of time and capital and will distract management from business operations. Any of the foregoing would further harm the Company\u2019s reputation and financial results.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on Sensus\u2019 business.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, included, among other things, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013. This excise tax imposed a significant increase in the tax burden on the medical device industry. This excise tax was repealed in 2018. Other elements of this law, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions, may significantly affect the payment for, and the availability of, healthcare services and may result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs, any of which may materially affect numerous aspects of our business.\nOther healthcare reform measures may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the reimbursement received for procedures utilizing our products. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the law discussed above was enacted that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues. Changes to existing laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on Sensus\u2019 business and financial operations. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the Company from being able to increase revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize its devices. In addition, other legislative changes may be enacted or existing regulations, guidance or interpretations may be changed, each of which may adversely affect operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf the Company\u2019s patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect its products, we may lose market share to competitors and be unable to operate business profitably.\nSensus\u2019 success significantly depends on its ability to protect proprietary rights to the technologies used in its products. The Company relies on two U.S. patents and two foreign patents, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions, to protect proprietary technology. The Company also has patent applications currently pending and in the process of being submitted. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect its rights or permit Sensus to gain or keep any competitive advantage. For example, some or all of the pending patent applications or any future pending applications may be unsuccessful. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in the pending patent applications or future patent applications, and patents issued as a result of these patent applications, if any, may not provide Sensus with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous. Sensus could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of its inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in its issued patents. Third parties may successfully challenge issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, which would render these patents invalid or unenforceable, which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to stop competitors from marketing and selling related products. In addition, pending patent applications include claims to aspects of the Company\u2019s products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents, and third parties may successfully patent those aspects before us or otherwise challenge Sensus\u2019 rights to these aspects.\nBoth the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may be able to design around Sensus\u2019 patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable to the Company\u2019s products. Although Sensus has entered into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with certain of its employees, consultants and advisors in order to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary technology, these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. In addition, Sensus has not sought patent protection in all countries where it sells products. If Sensus fails to timely file a patent application in any such country or major market, Sensus may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Competitors may use the Company\u2019s technologies in jurisdictions where Sensus has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which Sensus has patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., if at all.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon one of the Company\u2019s patents or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents and rights may be difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to defend these patents against challenges or to enforce Sensus\u2019 intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention. Moreover, the Company may not have sufficient resources to defend patents against challenges or to enforce intellectual property rights, any of which would adversely affect its ability to compete.\nIf Sensus\u2019 trademarks or trade names are not adequately protected, then the Company may be unable to build name recognition in markets of interest and business may be adversely affected.\nSensus\u2019 registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to infringe other marks. Sensus may be unable to protect the rights to these trademarks and trade names, which the Company needs to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in markets of interest. If these trademarks are challenged, infringed upon, circumvented, or declared generic or infringing, or if the Company is unable to establish name recognition based on these trademarks and trade names, then it may be unable to compete effectively and the Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive patent litigation, and if Sensus becomes subject to litigation, it could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention, require the Company to pay significant damages or royalty payments, or prevent the Company from marketing and selling existing or future products.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. Determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. As the number of participants in the market for skin cancer and general oncology devices and treatments increases, the possibility of patent infringement claims against Sensus increases. Any infringement claims, litigation or other proceedings would place a significant strain on the Company\u2019s financial resources, divert the attention of management from the core business and harm Sensus\u2019 reputation.\nAdverse outcomes in litigation or similar proceedings could adversely impact business.\nSensus may in the future be, named as a party to litigation or other similar legal proceedings. Adverse outcomes in any or all of these proceedings could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect its ability to continue conducting business. If an unfavorable final outcome in any such matter becomes probable and reasonably estimable, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Sensus\u2019 Securities\nWe have a history of net losses. If we do not achieve profitability, our financial condition and the value of our common stock could suffer.\nSensus has a history of net losses. The historical losses from inception through December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $21.9 million. The Company has significantly reduced its research and development expenses and is planning to continue to control these expenses as it competes the research and development of the final stages for the Sculptura. However, there can be no assurances that this and other actions will result in the Company\u2019s profitability.\nLimited trading activity for shares of Sensus\u2019 common stock may contribute to price volatility.\nWhile Sensus\u2019 common stock are listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there has been limited trading activity in the Company\u2019s shares. Due to the limited trading activity of Sensus\u2019 common stock, relativity small trades may have a significant impact on the price of these securities.\nThe Company does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, investors must rely on price appreciation of Sensus\u2019 common stock for a return on its investment in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company expects to retain any funds and future earnings to support the operation, growth and development of its business and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, a return on an investor\u2019s investment in the near future will occur only if the Company\u2019s share price appreciates. Sensus\u2019 common stock price may not appreciate in value or maintain the price at which an investor purchased these securities, and in either case, may not realize a return on investment or could lose all or part of an investment in Sensus\u2019 securities.\nAny future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of Sensus\u2019 Board of Directors and will be subject to compliance with applicable laws and covenants under any credit facilities, which may restrict or limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends. For example, the Company\u2019s current revolving line of credit restricts the ability to pay dividends or make any distributions or payments or redeem, retire or purchase any capital stock without the prior written consent of the lender, provided that Sensus may pay dividends solely in common stock. Also, the form, frequency and amount of dividends will depend upon the Company\u2019s future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. Sensus may not pay dividends as a result of any of the foregoing, and in these cases, an investor would need to rely on price appreciation of Sensus\u2019 common stock for a return on investment.\nGeneral stock market volatility could result in significant declines in the trading price of our securities, and an investor could lose all or a substantial part of an investment.\nStock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. In addition, limited trading volume of Sensus\u2019 securities may contribute to its future volatility. Price declines in Sensus\u2019 securities could result from general market and economic conditions, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, and a variety of other factors, including any of the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of Sensus\u2019 securities, regardless of the Company\u2019s operating performance, and could cause an investor to lose all or part of an investment in Sensus\u2019 securities since an investor might be unable to sell these securities at or above the price paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of Sensus\u2019 securities include the following:\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u25cf volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of medical device company stocks;\n\u25cf changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other medical device companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u25cf sales of Sensus\u2019 securities by the Company or stockholders;\n\u25cf failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of the Company, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow Sensus or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf the financial projections the Company may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or failure to meet those projections;\n\u25cf rumors and market speculation involving Sensus or other companies in the industry;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in the Company\u2019s results of operations or fluctuations in results of operations;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated developments in the Company\u2019s business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u25cf litigation involving Sensus, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into the Company\u2019s operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning Sensus\u2019 intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by the Company or our competitors;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to the business;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf any significant change in the Company\u2019s management; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of the Company\u2019s markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against Sensus, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nSensus is both an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nSensus is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. As such,the Company can take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company\u2019s periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u25cf exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nSensus is expected to remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021, following which it would continue to be a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d which will enable it to continue to take advantage of many of these exemptions, as discussed below. Investors may find Sensus\u2019 common stock less attractive if the Company chooses to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find Sensus\u2019 common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and the price of its common stock may be more volatile.\nSensus is also a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that its \u201cpublic float\u201d - the outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates - had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. Thus, even if the Company is no longer an emerging growth company, as a smaller reporting company, the Company could take advantage of certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of Sensus\u2019 internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, Sensus takes advantage of the ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial prospects, as the information provided to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one holds shares.\nSensus\u2019 executive officers and directors may exert control over the Company and may exercise influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nSensus\u2019 executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock as of February 8, 2021. Accordingly, these stockholders, if they act together, may exercise substantial influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control over the Company, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market value of Sensus\u2019 common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about Sensus\u2019 business, the price of the Company\u2019s securities and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for Sensus\u2019 securities depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about the Company or business. Sensus may be unable to attract or sustain coverage by well-regarded securities and industry analysts. If either none or only a limited number of securities or industry analysts cover the Company, or if these securities or industry analysts are not widely respected within the general investment community, the trading price for Sensus\u2019 securities would be materially and negatively impacted. In the event the Company obtains securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover Sensus downgrades the securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company, the price of Sensus\u2019 securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Sensus, or fail to publish reports on the Company regularly, demand for the Company\u2019s securities could decrease, which might cause the price of its securities and trading volume to decline.\nSensus\u2019 certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring the Company and may prevent attempts by the Company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove the current directors and management.\nProvisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (where the Company is incorporated), and the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which an investor might otherwise receive a premium for its stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by the Company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove the current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove the Company\u2019s board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u25cf requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s stock and assets;\n\u25cf eliminating the ability of stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf dividing the Company\u2019s Board of Directors into three classes so that only one third of the directors will be up for election in any given year; and\n\u25cf providing that the Company\u2019s directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of Sensus\u2019 then-outstanding common stock and only for cause.\nIn addition, Sensus is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that could result in a premium over the market price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions will apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the Company\u2019s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Sensus and its stockholders and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Sensus\u2019 common stock.\nSensus\u2019 certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between the Company and its stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees.\nSensus\u2019 certificate of incorporation provides that, unless the Company consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage these lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Sensus may incur additional costs associated with resolving the action in other jurisdictions, which could harm business and financial condition.\nIf Sensus fails to maintain proper and effective internal controls, the Company\u2019s ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of the Company or its business could be harmed, resulting in a decrease in value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs a public company, Sensus is required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal controls. In addition, the Company is required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting beginning with the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K following the date on which Sensus is no longer an emerging growth company or the date Sensus no longer qualifies as a smaller reporting company. Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require the Company to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. If Sensus is unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or the Company and the independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of Sensus\u2019 common stock could decline and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be impaired if information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems are critically important to operating business efficiently. Sensus\u2019 relies on information technology systems to manage business data, communications, employee information, and other business processes. The Company outsources certain business process functions to third-party providers and similarly relies on these third parties to maintain and store confidential information on their systems. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as the Company anticipates could disrupt business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing business and results of operations to suffer.\nAlthough Sensus protects our information technology systems, Sensus has experienced varying degrees of cyber-incidents in the normal conduct of business, including viruses, worms, phishing and other malicious activities. Although there have been no serious consequences to date, such breaches could result in unauthorized access to information including customer, supplier, employee, or other company confidential data. Sensus carries insurance against these risks, perform penetration tests from time to time, and design business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, the Company\u2019s efforts to mitigate these risks may be unsuccessful for security breaches not to occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. The Company has experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber security threats and incidents, none of which has been material to Sensus to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on operations and subject the Company to consequences such as direct costs associated with incident response.", "PERMNO": 16145, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SRTS"}
