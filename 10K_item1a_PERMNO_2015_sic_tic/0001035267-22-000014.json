{"cik": "1035267", "company": "INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider each of the following risk factors, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nPUBLIC HEALTH CRISES OR EPIDEMIC DISEASES, OR THE PERCEPTION OF THEIR EFFECTS, HAVE AND COULD CONTINUE TO MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as the current outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, our supply chains and distribution systems, and our expenses, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments are taking. In addition, hospitals are also experiencing staffing shortages and supply chain issues that could impact their ability to provide patient care. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of that disease. In addition, our customers have delayed, cancelled, or redirected and, in the future, may delay, cancel, or redirect planned capital expenditures in order to focus resources on COVID-19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID-19. For example, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, in the first half of 2020, we experienced a significant decline in procedure volume in the U.S. and Western Europe, as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. In addition, U.S. and global public health bodies have, at times, recommended delaying elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, and surgeons and medical societies are evaluating the risks of minimally invasive surgeries in the presence of infectious diseases, which we expect will continue to negatively impact the usage of our products and the number of da Vinci procedures performed. Also, as we are conducting IDE studies to support 510(k) submission for da Vinci platforms and for seeking new indications, we may experience delays in obtaining new product approvals, certifications, or clearances from the FDA or foreign approvals or certifications from foreign authorities or notified bodies or delays in recruiting patients in our ongoing and planned clinical studies.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced significant business disruptions, including restrictions on our ability to travel as well as distribute and service our products, temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers, and a reduction in access to our customers due to diverted resources and priorities and the business hours of hospitals, as governments institute prolonged shelter-in-place and/or self-quarantine mandates. For example, our corporate headquarters and many of our operations, including certain of our manufacturing facilities, are located in California, which previously instituted risk reduction orders applicable to our employees in that region, significantly impacting the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products and hampering our products from moving through the supply chain. These unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus taken by local governments and healthcare authorities globally, including the deferral of elective medical procedures and social distancing measures, have had, and we expect will continue to have, a negative impact on our operations and financial results. Furthermore, our future ways of working changes, including fully remote and hybrid work environments, may present additional risks, uncertainties, and costs that could affect our performance, including increased operational risk, uncertainty regarding office space needs, heightened vulnerability to cyber attacks due to remote work, potential reduced productivity, changes to our company culture, and increased costs to ensure our offices are safe and functional as hybrid offices that enable effective collaboration of both remote and in-person colleagues.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the economies and financial markets of many countries, which may result in a period of regional, national, and global economic slowdown or regional, national, or global recessions that could curtail or delay spending by hospitals and affect demand for our products as well as increased risk of customer defaults or delays in payments. Our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase, lease, or service of our products due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures, or other reasons. COVID-19 and the current financial, economic, and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, volume of business, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOutbreaks of other epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as, historically, the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or the H1N1 virus, could also divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of that disease. An outbreak of other contagious diseases could negatively affect hospital admission rates or disrupt our business similar to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted above. Any of these\noutbreaks could negatively impact the number of procedures performed and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOUR RELIANCE ON SOLE AND SINGLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS AND OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF MATERIALS, PARTS, AND COMPONENTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR WITHIN BUDGET.\nSome of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers or single-sourced suppliers. We generally purchase components through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. While alternative suppliers exist and could be identified for single-sourced components, the disruption or termination of the supply of components, or inflationary pressure in our supply chain, could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our operating results. A disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction, and damage our reputation and our brand. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The time and processes associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products on schedule or within budget, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, our ability to meet customers\u2019 demands depends, in part, on our ability to timely obtain an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components from our suppliers. An information technology systems interruption, including cybersecurity attacks, could adversely affect the ordering, distribution, and manufacturing processes of our suppliers. Difficulties in obtaining a sufficient supply of semiconductor and other component materials continue to increase, and we expect such difficulties to persist in the foreseeable future. Prices of such materials have also increased, and global supply has become significantly constrained due to the increased demand for materials, including semiconductors, to support expansion of server and cloud networks as a greater proportion of the global population worked remotely, the introduction of 5G, and the continued electrification of vehicles. We engage in activities to seek to mitigate such supply disruptions by, for example, increasing our communications with our suppliers and modifying our purchase order coverage and inventory levels. However, notwithstanding these activities, the global semiconductor and materials supply shortage is likely to remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. Such global shortages in important components have resulted in, and will continue to cause, inflationary pressure in our supply chain, which would impact our profits and profit margin. If shortages and price increases in important supply-chain materials in the semiconductor or other markets continue, we could also fail to meet product demand, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nBECAUSE OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE TO PURCHASE OUR COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MAY NOT ACCEPT DA VINCI ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.\nRobotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System is a technology that competes with established and emerging treatment options in both disease management and reconstructive medical procedures. These competitive treatment options include conventional MIS, open surgery, interventional approaches, and pharmacological regimens. Some of these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and, in many cases, have a long history of use. Technological advances could make such treatments more effective or less expensive than using our products, which could render our products obsolete or unmarketable. Studies could be published that show that other treatment options are more beneficial and/or cost-effective than robotic-assisted surgery. We cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will continue to be competitive with current or future technologies.\nAdditionally, we face or expect to face competition from companies that develop or have developed wristed, robotic-assisted, or computer-assisted surgical systems and products. Companies have introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field including, but not limited to, the following companies: Asensus Surgical, Inc.; avateramedical GmbH; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson; Medicaroid, Inc.; Medrobotics Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; MicroPort Scientific Corporation; Olympus Corporation; Samsung Group; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; and Titan Medical Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become competitors. Our revenues may be reduced due to pricing pressure or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective or less expensive than our products. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues will suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, or cash flows. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors, especially those with greater resources.\nIn addition, third-party service providers that provide services to da Vinci Surgical System operators may emerge and compete with us on price or offerings. To date, substantially all of our customers have sourced services on their da Vinci Surgical Systems from us through service contract commitments or time and materials contracts. Furthermore, there are third-party service providers offering consulting services targeted at analyzing the cost-effectiveness of hospitals\u2019 robotic-assisted surgery programs, including procedures performed, placement of systems, and consumption of instruments and accessories. We currently provide similar services and analysis to our customers, but it is difficult to assess the impact that this may have on our business. If we are unable to compete successfully with any third-party service providers, our revenues may suffer.\nTHE INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nChanges in economic conditions and supply chain constraints and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs, could lead to higher inflation than previously experienced or expected, which could, in turn, lead to an increase in costs. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation. Impacts from inflationary pressures could be more pronounced and materially adversely impact aspects of our business with revenue streams and cost commitments linked to contractual agreements that extend further into the future, as we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust pricing, reduce costs, or implement counter measures.\nIF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.\nThe da Vinci Surgical System and our other products represent a fundamentally new way of performing medical procedures. Achieving and maintaining physician, patient, and third-party payor acceptance of robotic-assisted medical procedures as a preferred method of performing these procedures is crucial to our success. If our products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, customers will not purchase our products, and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that physicians\u2019 and third-party payors\u2019 acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing techniques. Even if we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical studies, physicians may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example, cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional heart surgery simply because such surgery is already widely accepted. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly in light of ongoing healthcare reform initiatives and the evolving U.S. healthcare environment.\nWe expect that there will continue to be a learning process involved for patient care teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Broad use of our products requires training of patient care teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to rapidly train patient care teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products.\nIF INSTITUTIONS OR SURGEONS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR PROCEDURES USING OUR PRODUCTS, OR IF REIMBURSEMENT IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT SALES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.\nIn the U.S., hospitals generally bill for the services performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other government programs, and private insurance plans. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if government and private payors\u2019 policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In addition, to the extent that there is a shift from an inpatient setting to outpatient settings, we may experience pricing pressure and a reduction in the number of procedures performed. Our success in OUS markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for coverage and reimbursement through government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors. Reimbursement practices vary significantly by country. Many OUS markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Other foreign markets have both private insurance systems and government-managed systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement in any country within a particular time. In addition, healthcare cost containment efforts similar to those in the U.S. are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we sell, and intend to sell, our products, and these efforts are expected to continue. Please see our risk factor below titled \u201cChanges in Healthcare Legislation and Policy May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional risks related to the ability of institutions or surgeons to obtain reimbursements.\nIF OUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN DEFECTS OR ENCOUNTER PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS, WE MAY HAVE TO RECALL OUR PRODUCTS, INCUR ADDITIONAL UNFORESEEN COSTS, AND OUR REPUTATION MAY SUFFER.\nOur success depends on the quality and reliability of our products. While we subject components sourced and products manufactured to stringent quality specifications and processes, our products incorporate mechanical parts, electrical components, optical components, and computer software, any of which may contain errors or exhibit failures, especially when products are first introduced. Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, the patient. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures, due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure, we and our customers have an increased sensitivity to such defects. In the past, we have voluntarily recalled certain products. Although our products are subject to stringent quality processes and controls, we cannot provide assurance that our products will not experience component aging, errors, or performance problems. If we experience product flaws or performance problems, any or all of the following could occur:\n\u2022delays in product shipments;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022delay in market acceptance;\n\u2022diversion of our resources;\n\u2022damage to our reputation;\n\u2022product recalls, which can include, but not be limited to, product withdrawals from the market, labeling changes, design changes, customer notifications, and notifications to global regulatory bodies;\n\u2022regulatory actions;\n\u2022increased service or warranty costs; or\n\u2022product liability claims.\nCosts associated with defects or performance problems of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS RELATING TO THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, DIVERT MANAGEMENT\u2019S ATTENTION, AND HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nWe are, and may become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. Certain current lawsuits and pending proceedings to which we are party, including purported class actions, product liability litigation, and patent litigation, are described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nIn particular, our business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims, which are inherent to the medical device industry. Product liability claims have been brought against us by, or on behalf of, individuals alleging that they have sustained personal injuries and/or death as a result of purported product defects, the alleged failure to warn, and/or the alleged inadequate training by us of physicians regarding the use of the da Vinci Surgical System. The individuals who have brought the product liability claims seek recovery for their alleged personal injuries and, in many cases, punitive damages. Current product liability claims have resulted in negative publicity regarding our Company, and these and any other product liability or negligence claims or product recalls also could harm our reputation. Please see our risk factor below titled \u201cNegative Publicity, Whether Accurate or Inaccurate, Concerning Our Products or Our Company Could Reduce Market Acceptance of Our Products and Could Result in Decreased Product Demand and a Decline in Revenues\u201d for additional risks related to the potential effects of negative publicity on our business.\nThe outcome of these product liability claims and other legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. We currently self-insure our product liability risk and maintain third-party insurance coverage for certain other liabilities. However, we cannot determine whether our insurance coverage from third-party carriers, or our self-insurance of product liability risk, would be sufficient to cover the costs or potential losses related to these lawsuits and proceedings or otherwise be excluded under the terms of any third-party policy. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant legal costs (including settlements, judgments, legal fees, and other related defense costs) and diversion of management attention. If we do not prevail in the purported class actions, product liability litigation, or other legal proceedings, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT, UNINSURED LIABILITIES.\nFor certain risks, we do not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or availability. For example, we self-insure our product liability risks, and we indemnify our directors and officers for third-party claims and do not carry insurance to cover that indemnity or the related underlying potential losses. We also do not carry, among other types of coverage, earthquake insurance. In addition, in the future, we may not continue to maintain certain existing insurance coverage or adequate levels of coverage. Premiums for many types of insurance have increased significantly in recent years and, depending on market conditions and our circumstances, in the future, certain types of insurance, such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Because we retain some portion of our insurable risks and, in some cases, we are entirely self-insured, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insurance coverage could require us to pay substantial amounts, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNEGATIVE PUBLICITY, WHETHER ACCURATE OR INACCURATE, CONCERNING OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR COMPANY COULD REDUCE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND COULD RESULT IN DECREASED PRODUCT DEMAND AND A DECLINE IN REVENUES.\nThere have been articles published and reports questioning patient safety and efficacy associated with robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci Surgical System and its cost relative to other disease management methods and the adequacy of surgeon training. Negative publicity, including statements made by public officials, whether accurate or inaccurate, concerning our products or our Company could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and a decline in revenues. In addition, significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, regardless of whether these claims are meritorious. The number of claims could be further increased by plaintiffs\u2019 law firms that use a wide variety of media to advertise their services and solicit clients for product liability cases against us.\nIF WE LOSE KEY PERSONNEL OR ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WILL BE HARMED AND INCREASES IN LABOR COSTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. For example, our product development plans depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain engineers with experience in mechanics, electronics, software, and optics. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the constrained labor market and competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies. Moreover, we may encounter higher recruiting expenses, wage rates, and retention benefits. The extent and duration of the impact of labor market challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, availability of qualified and highly skilled persons in the markets where we operate and unemployment levels within these markets, behavioral changes, such as fully engaging employees and earning loyalty, prevailing wage rates, health and other insurance and benefit costs, inflation, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations or government programs, safety levels of our operations, and our reputation within the labor market. The loss of any of our qualified personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete and related expenses could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWE EXPERIENCE LONG AND VARIABLE CAPITAL SALES CYCLES AND SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS, WHICH MAY CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nThe sales and purchase order cycle of our systems is lengthy, because the systems are major capital items and their purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and government bodies, as applicable. In addition, sales to some of our customers are subject to competitive bidding or public tender processes. These approval and bidding processes can be lengthy. As a result, hospitals may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with the timing of their capital budget timelines. Further, IDN groups are creating larger networks of system users with increasing purchasing power and are increasingly evaluating their robotic-assisted surgery programs to optimize the efficiency of surgeries using da Vinci Surgical Systems. Further, the introduction of new products could adversely impact our sales cycle as customers take additional time to assess the benefits and costs of such products. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the length of capital sales cycles and, therefore, the exact timing of capital sales. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset.\nWe have experienced procedure growth for a number of benign conditions, including hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexies, hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and certain other surgeries. Many of these types of surgeries may be postponed in the short term by patients to avoid vacation periods and for other personal scheduling reasons. Patients may also accelerate procedures to take advantage of insurance funding cut-off dates. Historically, we have experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters of the year and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters of the year. The timing of procedures\nand changes in procedure growth directly affect the timing of instrument and accessory purchases and capital purchases by customers.\nThe above factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Because of these fluctuations, it is possible that, in future periods, our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations, among other factors, also mean that our operating results in any particular period may not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nNEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS AND INTRODUCTIONS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nWe develop and introduce new products with enhanced features and extended capabilities from time to time. We may introduce new products that target different markets than what our existing products target. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful research and development, regulatory clearances, approvals, or certifications, pricing, competition, market and consumer acceptance, the effective forecasting and management of product demand, inventory levels, the management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.\nWe invest substantially in various research and development projects to expand our product offerings. Our research and development efforts are critical to our success, and our research and development projects may not be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers or meet our expectations. Our research and development investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. In addition, the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or reduce demand for our current products, thereby offsetting any benefits of successful product introductions and potentially leading to challenges in managing inventory of existing products.\nOur products are subject to various regulatory processes, and we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications in order to sell our new products. If a potential purchaser believes that we plan to introduce a new product in the near future or if a potential purchaser is located in a country where a new product that we have introduced has not yet received regulatory clearance or certification, planned purchases may be deferred or delayed. In the past, we have experienced a slowdown in demand for existing products in advance of new product introductions and may experience a slowdown in demand in the future as well. It is also possible that a new product introduction could cause downward pressure on the prices of our existing products or require us to change how we sell our products, either of which could have material adverse effect on our revenues.\nIf we fail to effectively develop new products and manage new product introductions in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS DUE TO OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.\nWe manufacture, perform research and development activities, and distribute our products in OUS markets. Revenue from OUS markets accounted for approximately 33%, 32%, and 30% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our OUS operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022failure to obtain or maintain the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights as we have in the U.S.;\n\u2022multiple OUS regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products;\n\u2022changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022protectionist laws, policies, and business practices that favor local competitors or lead to non-U.S. customers favoring domestic technology solutions, which could slow our growth in OUS markets;\n\u2022local or national regulations that make it difficult or impractical to market or use our products;\n\u2022U.S. relations with the governments of the other countries in which we operate;\n\u2022inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;\n\u2022the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing OUS operations, including differing labor relations;\n\u2022the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets;\n\u2022building and maintaining an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations, including appropriate business procedures and controls;\n\u2022anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials;\n\u2022antitrust and anti-competition laws;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; and\n\u2022business interruptions due to natural disasters, outbreak of disease, climate change, and other events beyond our control.\nWe have increased, and will continue to increase, our operations in China. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China and the U.S., that political, diplomatic, military, or other events could result in business disruptions, including increased regulatory enforcement against companies, tariffs, trade embargoes, and export restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers and restructuring business relationships. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending. Any of these events could reduce customer demand, increase the cost of our products and services, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses and results of operations.\nFor example, in 2020, the U.S. government amended the Entity List rules to expand the requirement to obtain a license prior to the export of certain technologies. In addition, in 2020, a new U.S. regulation seeks to prohibit the U.S. government from contracting with companies who use the products or services of certain Chinese companies. We believe that these regulations do not materially impact our business at this time but cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future. These actions or similar actions may result in policies and regulations in response that could adversely affect our business operations in China, or may otherwise limit our ability to offer our products and services in China and other parts of the world.\nFollowing a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d), the UK formally withdrew from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its relationship with the EU. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTCA\u201d) was applied provisionally as of January 1, 2021, and entered into force on May 1, 2021. The TCA does not specifically refer to medical devices. However, as a result of Brexit, the Medical Devices Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the \u201cEU Medical Devices Regulation\u201d) will not be implemented in the UK, and previous legislation that sought to mirror the EU Medical Devices Regulation in the UK law has been revoked. The regulatory regime for medical devices in Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) continues to be based on the requirements derived from previous EU legislation, and the UK may choose to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the EU Medical Devices Regulation going forward. CE markings will continue to be recognized in the UK, and certificates issued by EU-recognized notified bodies will be valid in the UK until June 30, 2023. For medical devices placed on the market in Great Britain after this period, the UK Conformity Assessed (\u201cUKCA\u201d) marking will be mandatory. In contrast, UKCA marking and certificates issued by UK notified bodies will not be recognized on the EU market. The TCA does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions). For medical devices that are locally manufactured but use components from other countries, the \u201crules of origin\u201d criteria will need to be reviewed. Depending on which countries products will ultimately be sold in, manufacturers may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in Great Britain. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and our business would likely be impacted and the demand for our products could be depressed.\nIn addition, the U.S. federal government has made changes to U.S. trade policy, including entering into a successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d), known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), effective as of July 1, 2020. In addition, the U.S. federal government has implemented, or is considering the imposition of, tariffs on certain foreign goods. Such tariffs and, if enacted, any further legislation or actions taken by the U.S. federal government that restrict trade, such as additional tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist or retaliatory measures taken by governments in Europe, Asia, and other countries, could adversely impact our ability to sell products and services in our OUS markets. Tariffs could increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that we earn on our products, which could make our products less\ncompetitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit our ability to offer our products and services.\nFurthermore, a large portion of our OUS sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive and/or less affordable in OUS markets.\nIf we are unable to meet and manage these risks, our OUS operations may not be successful, which would limit the growth of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, or cash flows.\nDISRUPTION OF CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR MATERIAL BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, CUSTOMER RELATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nInformation technology is critical to the success of our digital products, helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain our supply chain and manufacturing operations, operate effectively and efficiently, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, security breaches of our digital products, or the unauthorized access to, loss of, or damage to intellectual property, confidential information, or personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, security incidents, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast, and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations would be impaired, and could be materially impaired. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personal information. This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of security breaches by unauthorized persons, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems.\nIn addition, unauthorized persons may attempt to hack into our products or systems to obtain personal data relating to patients or employees, our confidential or proprietary information, or confidential information we hold on behalf of third parties. If the unauthorized persons successfully hack into or interfere with our connected products or services, they may create issues with product functionality that could pose a risk of loss of data, a risk to patient safety, and a risk of product recall or field activity, which could adversely impact our business and reputation. We have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents, and we make ongoing improvements to our information-sharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or steal personal information or intellectual property, or sabotage systems containing personal information or intellectual property, change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may not be able to anticipate and prevent these intrusions or mitigate them when and if they occur.\nWe also rely on external vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. The systems of these external vendors may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security of our own systems, and we are dependent on these third parties to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems. In addition to potential exposure to data breaches, security incidents, or other actions that may compromise the security of or interfere with the function of our systems, defects or vulnerabilities in the software or systems of our external vendors may expose failures in our internal controls and risk management processes, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows and may also harm our reputation, brand, and customer relationships.\nWhile we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We may experience attacks on or a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect personal information, confidential data, or sensitive data. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, including several years or longer. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations and could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products, impact the price of the Company\u2019s stock, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines, or judgments against the Company. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs, and security\nvulnerabilities could be significant. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personal information, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, and use of our products and services could decrease. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability, and regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGlobally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate, and recover from incidents.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPLEX AND EVOLVING LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO INFORMATION COLLECTION.\nThere are numerous state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, decisions, and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of different types of personal data and personal information and other customer or other data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. We may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for any failure to comply with such laws, regulations, and directives.\nFor example, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which is in effect across the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including, for example, imposing strict standards when obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, requiring robust disclosures to individuals, providing individual data rights, imposing short timelines for data breach notifications, limiting retention periods and secondary use of information, imposing certain requirements pertaining to health data as well as pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, as well as additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR provides that EEA member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EEA member states may result in fines of up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year and other administrative penalties. Compliance with the new data protection rules imposed by GDPR may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, beginning in January 1, 2021, companies have been subject to the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g., fines up to 4% of worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/extends that decision and remains under review by the Commission during this period. The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated in the long term. These changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.\nIn the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder, imposes privacy, security, and breach notification obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities and their covered subcontractors. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, as the result of a breach of unsecured personal information, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.\nEven when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), violating consumers\u2019 privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.\nFurther, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) went into effect on January 1, 2020, and gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information and how their personal information is used. The CCPA imposes compliance burdens on many organizations doing business in California who collect personal information about California residents. The CCPA\u2019s definition of personal information is very broad and specifically includes biometric information. The CCPA allows for significant fines by the state attorney general, as well as a private right of action from individuals in relation to certain security breaches. The enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other US states and creating the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. These developments are increasing our compliance burden and our risk, including risks of regulatory fines, litigation and associated reputational harm. Additionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d) recently passed in California. The CPRA will substantially expand the requirements of the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.\nIn addition, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cCJEU\u201d) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (\u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d) under which personal data could be transferred from the EU to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of EU-specified standard contractual clauses (a form of contract approved by the EU commission as an adequate personal information transfer mechanism), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that their use must be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the surveillance laws and right of individuals in the destination country. The CJEU went on to state that, if the competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the recipient country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer unless the data exporter has already done so itself. The European Commission has published revised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the EEA. The revised clauses must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021. Existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. We will be required to implement the revised standard contractual clauses in relation to relevant existing contracts and certain additional contracts and vendor arrangements within the relevant time frames. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR.\nWe rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer personal data from our EU business to the U.S. (including having previously relied on Privacy Shield) and are evaluating whether additional mechanisms will be required to establish adequate safeguards for personal data. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations or fines. Moreover, if we are unable to transfer Personal Information between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services and could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn Israel, The Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981 (the \u201cIsraeli Privacy Law\u201d) regulates the protection of privacy and personal data, along with several other specific regulations enacted thereunder and, in particular, the Privacy Protection Regulations (Data Security), 5777-2017 (together with Israeli Privacy Law, the \u201cIsraeli Privacy Law and Regulations\u201d). Under the Israeli Privacy Law and Regulations, organizations are subject to various privacy and data protection requirements, including mandatory registration of databases with the Israeli Registrar of Databases (if certain conditions are met), executing data processing agreements with data recipients, safeguarding the collection and processing of personal data, safeguarding the transfer of personal data (which is specifically subject to the requirements of the Privacy Protection Regulations), personal data breach notification obligations, and other requirements. The Privacy Protection Authority (the \u201cPPA\u201d) is responsible for enforcement of the Israeli Privacy Law and Regulations and periodically publishes opinions and guidelines on privacy matters. In terms of enforcement, failure to comply with the Israeli Privacy Law and Regulations can result in PPA investigations, administrative fines or sanctions, and civil or criminal actions (civil proceedings may include statutory damages without the need to prove actual damages).\nFurthermore, any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with or make effective modifications to our policies or to comply with any federal, state, or international privacy, data-retention, or data-protection-related laws, regulations, orders, or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, a loss of customer confidence, damage to our brand and reputation, and a loss of customers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, various federal, state, and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data-retention, and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our business or our reputation with customers. For example, some countries have adopted laws mandating that some personal information regarding\ncustomers in their country be maintained solely in their country. Having to maintain local data centers and redesign product, service, and business operations to limit personal information processing to within individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly.\nIF WE FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRE OR INTEGRATE NEW BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, AND TECHNOLOGY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED BENEFITS OR OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED.\nWe need to grow our businesses in response to changing technologies, customer demands, and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may decide to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products, or technologies rather than through internal development.\nIdentifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. In addition, completing an acquisition can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could harm our business and affect our financial results. Even if we complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products, technologies, or employees into our operations or may not fully realize some of the expected synergies. An acquired company may have deficiencies in product quality, regulatory marketing authorizations or certifications, or intellectual property protections, which are not detected during due diligence activities or which are unasserted at the time of acquisition. It may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for us to re-establish market access, regulatory compliance, or cure such deficiencies in product quality or intellectual property protection in such cases, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIntegrating an acquisition can also be expensive and time-consuming and may strain our resources. In many instances, integrating a new business will also involve implementing or improving internal controls appropriate for a public company at a business that lacks them. In addition, we may be unable to retain the employees of acquired companies or the acquired company\u2019s customers, suppliers, distributors, or other partners for a variety of reasons, including that these entities may be our competitors or may have close relationships with our competitors. In 2019, we acquired certain assets and operations from Sch\u00f6lly Fiberoptic GmbH, a supplier of endoscopes and other visualization equipment and, in 2020, we acquired Orpheus Medical Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (\u201cOrpheus Medical\u201d) to deepen and expand our integrated informatics platform. The integration of these acquisitions involves complex operations across different geographic locations and new products, distribution networks, and legal jurisdictions. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we can successfully integrate either or both of these acquisitions or realize the expected benefits from these acquisitions. Failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, JOINT VENTURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, OR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM SUCH ALLIANCES, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.\nFrom time to time, we enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships to complement or augment our research and development, product development, training, procedure development, and marketing efforts. For example, in 2016, we entered into an agreement to form the Joint Venture. In January 2019, the Joint Venture acquired certain assets related to the da Vinci distribution business of Chindex, a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, which has been our distribution partner for da Vinci Surgical Systems in China since 2011, following which the Joint Venture began direct distribution operations for da Vinci products and services in China. There can be no assurance that we and the Joint Venture can successfully complete the development of robotic-assisted, catheter-based medical devices, or that we and the Joint Venture will successfully commercialize such products. There can also be no assurance that the Joint Venture will not require additional contributions to fund its business, that the Joint Venture will become profitable, or that the acquired Chindex assets will be successfully integrated and that the expected benefits will be realized. Proposing, negotiating, and implementing collaborations, in-licensing agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. In addition, other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology, or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. As a result, we may not identify, secure, or complete any such arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or on otherwise favorable terms, if it all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits from these alliances. In addition, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding any collaboration or other arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our alliances may have economic or business interests that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our interests. It is possible that conflicts may arise in these relationships, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations, termination rights, or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the\ncollaboration. These alliances can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of the parties involved, and we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.\nThere can be no assurance that we will realize a return on our strategic investments. Further, if we acquire privately held companies, valuations of such companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that our investments in privately held companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record impairments, which could be material and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThese alliances may also involve significant expense and divert the focus and attention of our management and other key personnel. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, or disrupt our ordinary business activities. Such arrangements may also expose us to numerous known and unknown risks, including unique risks with respect to the economic, political, and regulatory environment of any foreign entities with whom we partner, including Fosun Pharma. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOUR CUSTOMERS MAY USE UNAUTHORIZED, UNAPPROVED, OR UNCERTIFIED INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated through our sales of instruments and accessories. Third parties have attempted to and may discover ways to manufacture and sell counterfeit reprocessed instruments and/or alter instruments that are compatible and function with the da Vinci Surgical System, and such activities may reduce our market share. While our sales arrangements with customers generally prohibit the use of unauthorized, unapproved, or uncertified instruments and accessories with da Vinci Surgical Systems, warranties will be void if such instruments and accessories are used, and a programmed memory chip inside each instrument is designed to prevent the instrument from being used for more than the prescribed number of procedures to help ensure that its performance meets specifications during each procedure, these measures may not prevent the use of unauthorized, unapproved, or uncertified instruments and accessories by our customers. In addition to potential reductions to our revenues and market share, sales of unauthorized instruments and accessories by third parties may create safety and health risks to da Vinci patients and could cause negative publicity for us if these products cause injuries and/or do not function as intended when used with da Vinci Surgical Systems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE EXPECT GROSS PROFIT MARGINS TO VARY OVER TIME, AND CHANGES IN OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGINS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur gross profit margins have fluctuated from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Our gross profit margins may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including the mix of system models sold or leased;\n\u2022changes in the portion of sales involving a trade-in of another system and the amount of trade-in credits given;\n\u2022introduction of new products, which may have lower margins than our existing products;\n\u2022our ability to maintain or reduce production costs;\n\u2022changes to our pricing strategy;\n\u2022changes in competition;\n\u2022changes in production volume driven by demand for our products;\n\u2022changes in material, labor, or other manufacturing-related costs, including the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for foreign currency-denominated costs;\n\u2022changes to U.S. and foreign trade policies, such as the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. including, but not limited to, goods imported from Mexico where we manufacture a majority of our instruments that we sell;\n\u2022inventory obsolescence and product recall charges; and\n\u2022market conditions.\nIf we are unable to offset the unfavorable impact of the factors noted above by increasing the volume of products shipped, reducing product manufacturing costs, or otherwise, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWE UTILIZE DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PORTION OF OUR SALES AND SERVICE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO A NUMBER OF RISKS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nWe have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products in certain countries. If these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to sell or service our products in the markets serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits against our distributors related to sales or service of our products performed by them. Please see our risk factor below titled \u201cWe Are Subject to Product Liability and Negligence Claims Relating to the Use of Our Products and Other Legal Proceedings That Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Divert Management\u2019s Attention, and Harm Our Business.\u201d Our distributors may affect our ability to effectively market our products in certain countries or regulatory jurisdictions if a distributor holds the regulatory authorization or certification in such countries or within such regions and causes, by action or inaction, the suspension of such marketing authorization or certification or sanctions for non-compliance. It may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for us to re-establish market access or regulatory compliance in such cases.\nWE OFFER ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL ACQUISITION APPROACHES. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE RISK OF LOSSES OF REVENUE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES.\nWe believe customer financing through leasing is an important consideration for some of our customers and have experienced an increase in demand for customer financing. We may experience loss from a customer\u2019s failure to make payments according to the contractual lease terms. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors.\nAlthough we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements. If the level of credit losses we experience in the future exceed our expectations, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our leasing arrangements allow customers to cancel, return, or upgrade the systems leased prior to the end of the lease term without incurring a financial penalty. We also lease our systems to certain qualified customers where the lease payments are based on their usage of the systems. While leases and usage-based arrangements enable our customers to upgrade and get access to new technologies faster, it may also enable competitors to more easily induce customers to switch to a competitor system. If customers do not perform a sufficient number of procedures on systems leased under usage-based arrangements, or return or terminate leases prematurely, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, or cash flows.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS.\nOur investment portfolio includes both domestic and international investments. The credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity concerns, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could fluctuate substantially. Our other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of investments, impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments, changes in interest rates, increases or decreases in cash balances, volatility in foreign exchange rates, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty could increase the risk that actual amounts realized on our investments may differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.\nOur Intuitive Ventures fund plans to invest in early-stage companies, which involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, uncertainties inherent in research and development; uncertainties regarding the ability of Intuitive Ventures to identify investment candidates; uncertainties regarding the success of Intuitive Ventures\u2019 investments; uncertainties and variables inherent in the operating and financial performance in investments made, including, among other things, competitive developments and general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and market conditions; future exchange and interest rates; and changes in tax and other laws, regulations, rates and policies.\nWhile we have not realized any significant losses on our cash equivalents, marketable securities, or other investments, future fluctuations in their value could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE MAY INCUR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE.\nOur operating results are subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects our foreign currency-denominated revenue. Margins on OUS revenue could also be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as we may not be able to raise local prices to fully offset the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to our foreign currency-denominated revenue and earnings, may cause us to reduce pricing on our products in our OUS markets and may cause us to incur losses on our foreign currency hedging instruments, thereby limiting the benefit that strengthened foreign currencies could have on our results of operations.\nWe attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. Although we have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily related to transactions denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, British Pound, and Swiss Franc, and we regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary, our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact caused by unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional discussion on the impact of foreign exchange risk.\nWE MAY ENCOUNTER MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS OR DELAYS THAT COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE.\nManufacturing our products is a complex process. We (or our critical suppliers) may encounter difficulties in scaling up or maintaining production of our products, including:\n\u2022problems involving production yields;\n\u2022quality control and assurance;\n\u2022component supply shortages;\n\u2022import or export restrictions on components, materials, or technology;\n\u2022shortages of qualified personnel; and\n\u2022compliance with state, federal, and foreign regulations.\nIf demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to develop or maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities or build new manufacturing capabilities or facilities on schedule or within budget, our ability to generate revenue and maintain profit margins as expected will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nDISRUPTIONS AT THE FDA AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR NOTIFIED BODIES CAUSED BY FUNDING SHORTAGES OR GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERNS COULD HINDER THEIR ABILITY TO HIRE, RETAIN, OR DEPLOY KEY LEADERSHIP AND OTHER PERSONNEL, OR OTHERWISE PREVENT PRODUCTS FROM BEING DEVELOPED, CLEARED, CERTIFIED, APPROVED, OR COMMERCIALIZED IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nHospital, health systems, and physicians depend on a number of government agencies and services to effectively deliver healthcare to their patients. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, or approvals or could cause other situations that could impede their ability to effectively deliver healthcare, including attempts to reduce payments and other reimbursements to hospitals by federal healthcare programs. These situations could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to perform procedures with our devices and/or their decisions to purchase additional products from us.\nIn addition, the ability of the FDA, foreign authorities, and notified bodies to review and clear, approve, or certify new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies or notified bodies, including a prolonged government shutdown, may cause significant regulatory delays and, therefore, delay our efforts to seek clearances, approvals, or certifications from the FDA, foreign authorities, and notified bodies and adversely affect business travel and import and export of products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\nor cash flows. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020 and, subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, on July 10, 2020, the FDA resumed certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA utilized this risk-based assessment system to assist in determining when and where it was safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. In May 2021, the FDA outlined a detailed plan to move toward a more consistent state of inspectional operations and, in July 2021, the FDA resumed standard inspectional operations of domestic facilities and was continuing to maintain this level of operation as of September 2021. Subsequently, in November 2021, the FDA announced its intention to resume certain prioritized inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities, including surveillance and application-related inspections, starting in February 2022. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or notified bodies from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or notified bodies to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor instance, in the EU, notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. While several notified bodies have been designated, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly slowed down their designation process, and the current designated notified bodies are facing a large number of requests with the new regulation, as a consequence of which review times have lengthened. This situation could impact our ability to grow our business in the EU and EEA.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT.\nThe development of our facilities is subject to risks relating to our ability to complete our projects on schedule or within budget. Factors that may result in a development project being prevented or delayed from completion or exceeding budget include, but are not limited to (i) construction delays, defects, or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs; (ii) cost escalations associated with materials, including changes in availability, proximity, and cost of materials, such as steel, cement, concrete, aggregates, oil, fuel, and other construction materials, including changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries, as well as cost escalations associated with subcontractors and labor; (iii) the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues; (iv) an inability to obtain, or a significant delay in obtaining, zoning, construction, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations; (v) difficulty in complying with local, city, county, and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities, and water quality, as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats; (vi) insufficient infrastructure capacity or availability (e.g., water, sewer, and roads) to serve the needs of our projects; (vii) failure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy levels; and (viii) condemnation of all or parts of development or operating properties, which could adversely affect the value or viability of such projects.\nCONTINUED CONSOLIDATION IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe healthcare industry has been consolidating, and organizations continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators, and third-party payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power within the markets in which we sell our products. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify, resulting in pricing pressures and decreased average selling prices. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further consolidation, which may exert further downward pressure on prices of our products and services and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPANY.\nUncertainty about global economic conditions, including credit and sovereign debt concerns in certain European countries and concerns about slowed economic growth in China and other OUS markets, has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the financial credit markets, volatile currency exchange rates, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, and liquidity concerns. Customers and distributors may choose to postpone or reduce spending due to financial difficulties or may be unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products due to restraints on credit. There could be additional effects from adverse conditions in the credit\nmarkets on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance the development and/or manufacturing of our products resulting in product delays.\nIn addition, our business is closely tied to the overall U.S. healthcare system, relating to which there are concerns and uncertainties as a result of efforts made by the U.S. federal government to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. In addition, the U.S. federal government has called for, or enacted, substantial changes to trade, fiscal, and tax policies, which may include changes to existing trade agreements including, but not limited to, the replacement of NAFTA by the USMCA (effective July 1, 2020), that may have a significant impact on our operations. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes could have on our business.\nIf economic conditions worsen or new legislation is passed related to the healthcare system or trade, fiscal, or tax policies, customer demand may not materialize to the levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULT IN LOSS OF REVENUE OR HIGHER EXPENSES.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, and other business disruptions including, but not limited to, internet security threats and violence motivated by political or social causes, could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and their aftermath created economic uncertainty and disrupted economic activities in Japan, including a reduction in hospital spending. Moreover, global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Our corporate headquarters and many of our operations, including certain of our manufacturing facilities, are located in California, which has experienced both severe earthquakes and other natural disasters in the past and is vulnerable to climate change effects. For example, increasing intensity of drought throughout the state and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages in the communities where we work and live. This danger has the potential to impact our employees\u2019 abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay connected effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not have multiple-site capacity for all of our operations in the event of a business disruption. In addition, global climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations resulting in the aforementioned natural disasters as well as other extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operations of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. The impacts of global climate change on water resources may result in water scarcity, which could impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs.\nConcern over global climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations, and the distribution of our products. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to our service offerings. Furthermore, parties in our supply chain and our customers are similarly vulnerable to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen, and severe adverse events. A natural disaster or a triggered global climate change event in any of our major markets, or an unanticipated business disruption caused, for example, by internet security threats, damage to global communication networks, or similar events, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions around the world. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate, including:\n\u2022the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;\n\u2022changes in share-based compensation; and\n\u2022changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to the tax laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE USE ESTIMATES, MAKE JUDGMENTS, AND APPLY CERTAIN METHODS IN DETERMINING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND IN MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF OUR BUSINESS. AS THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND METHODS CHANGE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRESS OF OUR BUSINESS COULD VARY.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nWe utilize methods for determining surgical market sizes as well as the number and type (cancerous or benign) of certain da Vinci procedures performed that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our estimates of surgical market sizes or the number and type of da Vinci procedures performed do not have an impact on our results of operations but are used to estimate the progress of our business. Estimates and judgments for determining surgical market sizes and the number and type of da Vinci procedures and the accuracy of these estimates may be impacted over time with changes in treatment modalities, hospital reporting behavior, system internet connectivity, distributor reporting behavior, increases in procedures per field employee, and other factors. In addition, from time to time, we may change the method for determining market sizes and the number and type of da Vinci procedures, causing variation in our reporting.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nCOMPLYING WITH FDA REGULATIONS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS, AND OUR FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLY COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.\nBecause our products, including the da Vinci Surgical System, are commercially distributed, numerous quality and post-market regulatory requirements apply, including the following:\n\u2022continued compliance to the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the development and manufacturing process;\n\u2022labeling regulations;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against false or misleading statements in the labeling or promotion of products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses;\n\u2022stringent complaint reporting and Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;\n\u2022adequate use of the corrective and preventive actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant, systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest the same; and\n\u2022the reporting of corrections and removals, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA recalls and field corrective actions taken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFFDCA\u201d) that may pose a risk to health.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from inspectional observations (as set forth on FDA Form 483) to a public Warning Letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions, including the seizure of our products and equipment or ban on the import or export of our products. The FDA has, in the past, issued and could, in the future, issue Warning Letters or other adverse communications to us. If we fail to satisfy or remediate the matters discussed in any such Warning Letters or communications, the FDA could take further enforcement action, including prohibiting the sale or marketing of the affected product. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The receipt of a Warning Letter could place certain limits on the ability to obtain FDA-issued Certificates to Foreign Government (\u201cCFGs\u201d) used for new and re-registration of products in certain other countries.\nThe FDA also strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion, and other activities relating to the marketing of our products. Medical devices may be promoted only for their cleared or approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the cleared or approved label. It is possible that federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they\nconsider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under a variety of statutory authorities, including under the FFDCA as well as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, any modification or change of medical devices cleared for market requires the manufacturer to make a determination whether the change is significant enough to require new 510(k) clearance. We have created labeling, advertising, and user training for the da Vinci Surgical System to describe specific surgical procedures that we believe are fully within the scope of our existing 510(k) indications for use stated in our 510(k) clearances. Although we have relied on expert in-house and external staff, consultants, and advisors, some of whom were formerly employed by the FDA and are familiar with the FDA perspective, we cannot provide assurance that the FDA would agree that all such specific procedures are within the scope of the existing general clearance or that we have compiled adequate information to support the safety and efficacy of using the da Vinci Surgical System for all such specific procedures. From time to time, we modify our products, including the hardware and software in the da Vinci Surgical System, after we obtain 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the devices in ways that we do not believe require new 510(k) clearance. We cannot provide assurance that the FDA would agree in all cases with our determinations not to seek new 510(k) clearance for any of these changes. If the FDA disagrees with our assessments that a new 510(k) clearance was not required prior to commercializing the devices with these changes or modifications, then the FDA could impose enforcement sanctions and/or require us to obtain 510(k) clearance or other FDA marketing authorization for any modification to our products. We may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until such marketing authorization is granted.\nWe have a wholly owned manufacturing facility located in Mexicali, Mexico, which manufactures reusable and disposable surgical instruments. This facility is registered with the FDA as well as with Mexican authorities. The facility is operated under U.S. and international quality system regulations, including those applicable to Canada, the EU, and Japan among others. Our wholly owned manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico has an FDA Establishment Registration but has not been inspected by the FDA to date. If the FDA were to identify non-conformances in our product documentation or quality system compliance, it could hold indefinitely the importation of instruments at the border, which would deprive us of the ability to sell and supply the majority of our customers until the FDA requirements have been satisfied. Similar supply disruptions could occur if key suppliers outside of the U.S. were to encounter non-conformances with their documentation or quality system compliance.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY AND UNCERTAIN DOMESTIC REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY DOMESTIC REGULATORY AUTHORIZATIONS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE U.S.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, promotion, sales, distribution, and post-market support and medical device reporting in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In order for us to market products for use in the U.S., we generally must first obtain clearance from the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FFDCA or approval of the product through the premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) pathway. Clearance under Section 510(k) requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered (\u201cpre-amendment\u201d) status and for which a PMA is not required. If we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered status, we may be required to obtain marketing authorization through the more burdensome PMA process or alternatively through the de novo classification process, which is a path to market for novel devices that are low to moderate risk and for which a predicate device is not available. A PMA is typically a much more complex, lengthy, and burdensome application than a 510(k) or a de novo classification request. To support a PMA, the FDA would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses. In some cases, such studies may also be required to support a 510(k) application or a de novo classification request. The FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its review of any marketing application submissions, or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA, either of which could delay or preclude the sale of new products in the U.S. In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition of granting marketing authorization. Product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following marketing authorization. Any delays or failure to obtain FDA marketing authorization for new or modified products that we develop, any limitations imposed by the FDA on new product use, or the costs of obtaining FDA clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may change their policies, adopt additional regulations, revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. We may be found non-compliant as a result of future changes in, or interpretations of, regulations by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical\ndata and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals include plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which any proposals, if adopted, could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances, or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.\nMore recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised guidance describing an optional \u201csafety and performance based\u201d premarket review pathway for manufacturers of \u201ccertain, well-understood device types\u201d to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list device types appropriate for the \u201csafety and performance based\u201d pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the recommended testing methods, where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our competitors seek or currently have received clearance, and it is unclear the extent to which such performance standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.\nIn order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an IDE application. Many of our products to date have been or would be considered significant risk devices requiring IDE approval prior to investigational use. We may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the U.S. for any new devices that we intend to market in the U.S. in the future.\nIf we do obtain such approvals, we may not be able to conduct studies which comply with the IDE and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device. Clinical testing is difficult to design and implement, can take many years, can be expensive, and carries uncertain outcomes and, if we fail to complete our planned or ongoing clinical trials or if such clinical trials produce negative or inconclusive results, we may be delayed or prevented from obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to commercialize our products for new or expanded indications. Additionally, we may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials for any number of reasons, which could adversely affect the costs, timing, or successful completion of our clinical trials. Moreover, the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting, or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. If we fail to complete our planned and ongoing clinical trials or if such clinical trials produce negative or inconclusive results, we may be delayed or prevented from obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to commercialize our products for new or expanded indications, which may limit the market for our products.\nFailure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certainty that clinical trials will meet desired endpoints, produce meaningful or useful data, and be free of unexpected adverse effects or that the FDA will accept the validity of foreign clinical study data cannot be assured, and such uncertainty could preclude or delay market clearance or authorizations resulting in significant financial costs and reduced revenue.\nOUR PRODUCTS MAY CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE MEDICAL EVENTS OR BE SUBJECT TO FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND, IF WE FAIL TO DO SO, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS THAT COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are subject to the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations and similar foreign regulations, which require us to report to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware\nof a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, approval, or certification, seizure of our products or delay in clearance, approval, or certification of future products.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects, or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Product defects or other errors may occur in the future.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new clearances, approvals, or certifications for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such clearances, approvals, or certifications may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA or foreign regulatory authorities warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. If the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities disagree with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls, and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us, and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nIF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE, OR OTHER MANUFACTURING STANDARDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR PART OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND/OR RECALL SOME PRODUCTS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT DELIVERY DELAYS AND LOST REVENUE.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and notified bodies, and our operations will continue to be regulated and inspected by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and notified bodies for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements contained in the QSR and other regulatory requirements. We are also required to comply with International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) quality system standards as well as EU legislation and norms in order to produce products for sale in the EU. In addition, many countries, such as Canada and Japan, have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing. If we fail to continue to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, as well as ISO or other regulatory standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations.\nWe continue to be subject to FDA and certain other inspections by other regulatory authorities and notified bodies at any time. Maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly. We cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO standards and other regulatory requirements in future inspections and audits by regulatory authorities and notified bodies.\nWe are currently participating in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (\u201cMDSAP\u201d), which allows an MDSAP-recognized auditing organization to conduct a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer that evaluates the Company\u2019s quality system to assess compliance with the requirements of multiple regulatory jurisdictions, including the U.S., Japan, Brazil, Australia, and Canada. The information collected in an MDSAP audit is shared and reviewed amongst all the regulatory authorities participating in the MDSAP, who may or may not determine that additional information or auditing is required.\nOur Sunnyvale, California facility is licensed by the State of California to manufacture medical devices. We have been subject to periodic inspections by the California Department of Health Services Food and Drug Branch and, if we are unable to maintain this license following any future inspections, we will be unable to manufacture or ship some products, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, both our Sunnyvale, California and Mexicali, Mexico facilities are subject to periodic inspections by other regulatory bodies, including third-party auditors on behalf of national regulatory authorities. Compliance with multiple regulatory standards is complex, difficult, and costly to maintain, and material\ndeficiencies could result in significant limitations on our ability to manufacture, transport, and sell our products in one or more countries.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY PROCESSES AND APPROVAL OR CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY APPROVALS OR CERTIFICATIONS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.\nTo be able to sell our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certifications and comply with the regulations of those countries, which may differ substantially from those of the U.S. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or certifications and the time required for regulatory review, and vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or certifications is complex, and timing to obtain clearances or certifications in those countries varies; therefore, we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals or certifications in any other country in which we plan to market our products or obtain such approvals or certifications on a favorable schedule. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or certification in any other country in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate revenue will be harmed. In particular, if the FDA refuses to provide CFGs, our ability to register products or renew such registrations may be delayed or denied.\nFor instance, one of the most significant moving targets related to the regulatory landscape is in the EU; more specifically, the medical devices regulation has recently evolved. On May 25, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation entered into force, which repeals and replaces the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the \u201cEU Medical Devices Directive\u201d). Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them) in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021, may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. In January 1999, further to their certification by our notified body, we affixed the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments and have maintained these certifications continuously since that time. Subsequent products and accessories have received certifications by our notified body, Presafe. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new, or reinforced, requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance, and vigilance requirements.\nSubject to the transitional provisions, in order to sell our products in EU member states, our products must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the former EU Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the European Conformity (\u201cCE\u201d) mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. It is the responsibility of the Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (\u201cPRRC\u201d) to ensure such requirements are fulfilled and in place in the company. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks that may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification and may include a technical documentation assessment and an onsite audit. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility, metrology, or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design, and final inspection of our devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements and we have the organizational structure to support it (i.e., PRRC), the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be unable to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the EU or any countries recognizing the CE mark.\nIn the EU, we must inform the notified body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices that we market or sell in the EU and the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our quality system or substantial changes to our medical devices that could affect compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation or cause a substantial change to the intended use for which the device has been CE marked.\nThe notified body will then assess the planned changes and verify whether they affect the products\u2019 ongoing conformity with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. If the assessment is favorable, the notified body will issue a new certificate of conformity or an addendum to the existing certificate attesting compliance with the general safety and performance requirements and quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the EU Medical Devices Regulation.\nIn addition, we are subject to annual regulatory audits in order to maintain the certifications we have already obtained, including inspection of our compliance to EU legislation and required standards. We cannot be certain that we will be able to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or that we will continue to meet the quality and performance standards required to maintain the certifications that we have already received. If we are unable to maintain our certifications, we will no longer be able to sell our products in EU member states and many affiliated countries that accept the CE mark, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the regulations applied to end users of our products may increase over time, forcing us to provide additional solutions to regulations that do not apply directly to us but which apply indirectly, as they may limit our customers\u2019 ability to use our products.\nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. Non-compliance with the above requirements would also prevent us from selling our products in these countries.\nFurther, Switzerland, which is the country from which we import our products into the EU and where our EU regulatory team is based, has not yet entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU that covers the Medical Device Regulation and allows medical devices to move freely between Switzerland and the EU. Therefore, for future needs, we will adjust the manner in which we bring our products into the EU market. Any such adjustments could cause temporary disruptions in and have adverse financial implications to our business in Europe.\nTo date, we received approvals from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for our da Vinci S, Si, Xi, and X Surgical Systems and various associated instruments and accessories for use in certain da Vinci procedures. We may seek additional approvals for other products and/or indications; however, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted. In addition, because not all of our instruments have received product approvals and reimbursement is an additional process to generate market acceptance, it is possible that procedures will be adopted slowly or not at all. Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are reimbursed by governmental health administration authorities. In April 2012 and April 2016, we have received reimbursement approval for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, respectively. An additional 12 procedures were granted reimbursement for Japan in April 2018, including gastrectomy, anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. An additional 7 procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2020. These additional 19 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these 19 procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da Vinci procedures. There are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures including those that require in-country clinical data and which are considered for reimbursed status in April of even-numbered years. If we are not successful in obtaining the necessary reimbursement approvals or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products could be limited. These limitations could eliminate a significant market opportunity for our products in Japan.\nOur capital sales in China are subject to importation authorizations and purchasing tender processes. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. After an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020 (ref. NHC Financial Notice [2020] 315), the government will allow for the total sale of 225 new Endoscopic Surgical Instrument Control Systems (surgical robots) into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Future system sales and our ability to grow future procedure volumes are dependent on the completion of these purchasing tender authorizations. The timing and magnitude of these future authorizations, which may determine our system placements in future years, is not certain, and we expect to continue to experience variability in the timing of capital sales in China.\nCHANGES IN HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION AND POLICY MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIn the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which made changes that have impacted and are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.\nThe ACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansions among other things. This included a number of Medicare payment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models and appropriated funding for comparative effectiveness research.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive branch, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021, for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. MACRA repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019, which are based on various performance measures and physicians\u2019 participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. It is unclear what impact new quality and payment programs, such as MACRA, may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nWe expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes to, or uncertainty with respect to, future reimbursement rates or changes in hospital admission rates could impact our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFurther, the federal, state, and local governments, Medicare, Medicaid, managed-care organizations, and foreign governments have, in the past, considered, are currently considering, and may, in the future, consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the U.S. or other countries, including retroactive and prospective rate and coverage criteria changes, competitive bidding or tender processes for certain products and services, and other changes intended to reduce expenditures along with uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future, what effect such policies would have on our business, or what effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN LAWS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, WHICH, IF VIOLATED, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES. ADDITIONALLY, CHALLENGES TO, OR INVESTIGATION INTO, OUR PRACTICES COULD CAUSE ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND BE COSTLY TO RESPOND TO AND, THUS, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of any tantalum, tin, gold, and tungsten used in manufacturing that may originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions (so called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d). These metals are central to the technology industry and are present in some of our products as component parts. In most cases, no acceptable alternative material exists that has the necessary properties. Because it is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis, we must obtain a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials from parties in our supply chain. The components that incorporate those metals may originate from many sources, and we purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used. Accordingly, components and assemblies we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We are required to carry out a diligent effort to determine and disclose the source of these materials. There can be no assurance that we can obtain this information accurately or reliably, or at all, from intermediate producers who may be unwilling or unable to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or to notify us if these sources change. In addition, these metals are subject to price fluctuations and shortages that can affect our ability to obtain the manufactured materials that we rely on at favorable terms or from consistent sources. These changes could have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and market our devices and products.\nWe are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, payments or other remuneration that could be considered to induce hospitals, physicians, or other potential purchasers of our products either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease, or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and any other third-party payor programs. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similar laws must be complied with in foreign jurisdiction.\nThe federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Although we do not submit claims directly to government payors, manufacturers can be held liable under the federal false claim act if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which created additional federal criminal statutes prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.\nThese laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements that we may have with hospitals, physicians, or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, speaker, education, and training programs, physician consulting, and other service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. Violating anti-kickback laws and false claims laws can result in civil and criminal fines and penalties, which can be substantial and include monetary damages and penalties, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs for non-compliance. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to defend and, thus, could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe federal Physicians Payments Sunshine Act imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on certain device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians (including family members), as defined by statute, certain non-physician practitioners, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals. Such information must be made publicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, as well as any transfers of value made to such physician owners and investors, during the preceding calendar year. Similar requirements apply in foreign jurisdictions. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year.\nMany states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices, and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians or marketing expenditures and pricing information. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may be found out of compliance with one or more of the requirements, subjecting us to significant civil monetary penalties.\nAdditionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our OUS operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties in the U.S. and/or abroad. These numerous, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations include U.S. laws, such as the FCPA, and similar laws in other countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nOur operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe upon these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and government investigations involving labor and employment. Such claims, lawsuits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, manufacturers, suppliers, and any other third parties we may engage in connection with development and commercialization may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless, and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) the laws of the FDA and other similar regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete, and accurate information to such authorities; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) data privacy, security, fraud, and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete, and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or the creation of fraudulent data in clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, other U.S. federal healthcare programs, or healthcare programs in other jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations.\nIF HOSPITALS AND OTHER SURGERY FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE, OR OTHER REGULATORY STANDARDS, THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR PART OF THEIR DA VINCI UTILIZATION.\nOur global customers are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities. Our customers are required to comply with applicable local and international regulations, including with respect to the reprocessing of da Vinci instruments and accessories. Hospitals may not follow cleaning and sterilization instructions properly, or equipment used for cleaning and sterilization may malfunction or be used improperly. If our customers deviate from cleaning and sterilization instructions, regulatory authorities may require them to suspend use of da Vinci Surgical Systems.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY PROTECT AND SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM USE BY THIRD PARTIES, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET MAY BE HARMED.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for the proprietary technologies contained in our products and on successfully defending our patents against infringing products and/or services in litigation or administrative proceedings, including patent oppositions, reviews, or reexaminations. We incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and, if necessary, defending our patent rights. We do not know whether we will be successful in obtaining the desired patent protection for our new proprietary technologies or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable when challenged. The success of defending our proprietary rights can be highly uncertain, because it involves complex and often evolving legal issues and procedures that are dependent on the particular facts of each case.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on other intellectual property rights, such as trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws to protect proprietary technologies. We further utilize nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as technical measures to protect our proprietary technologies. Nevertheless, these measures may be inadequate in protecting our technologies. If these measures are proved to be inadequate in protecting our technologies, our competitive advantages may be reduced. Moreover, we may not have adequate remedies for potential breaches by employees, consultants, and others who participate in developing our proprietary technologies against their agreements with us regarding intellectual property. As a\nresult, our trade secrets may be lost. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal to or superior to our technologies without infringing any of our intellectual property, which would harm our ability to compete in the market.\nAs foreign markets become more significant in revenue for us, our foreign operations and strategic alliances with foreign entities will likely increase. Our exposure to risks associated with these operations requires us to increase our reliance on protecting our intellectual property against infringing products and/or services in markets outside the U.S. The laws and judicial systems in these countries may introduce yet another level of uncertainty to our effort to obtain the desired protection as well as defending our rights.\nOTHERS MAY BE SUCCESSFUL IN ASSERTING THAT OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES AND/OR ENJOIN US FROM COMMERCIALIZING OUR PRODUCTS.\nAs we continue to introduce and commercialize new products and technologies, there may be U.S. and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to our products. Some of these patents may be broad enough to cover one or more aspects of our products. We do not know whether any of these patents, if challenged, would be held valid, enforceable, and infringed. From time to time, we receive, and likely will continue to receive, letters from third parties accusing us of infringing and/or inviting us to license their patents. We may be sued by, or become involved in an administrative proceeding with, one or more of these third parties.\nWe cannot be certain that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses that we may have concerning invalidity, unenforceability, or non-infringement of any third-party patent. In addition, other parties may have filed or will file patent applications covering products that are similar to or identical to ours. We cannot be certain that patents issuing from our own patent applications covering our products will have a priority date over any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party.\nThe medical device industry has experienced extensive intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings. If third parties assert infringement claims or institute administrative proceedings against us, our technical and management personnel will need to spend significant time and effort, and we will incur large expenses in defending against these attacks. We cannot be certain that we will prevail in defending against infringement, validity, or enforceability claims against us. If plaintiffs in patent administrative proceedings are successful, our patent portfolio may be adversely affected. If plaintiffs in any patent action are successful, we may be enjoined from selling or importing our products, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, or we may be required to obtain a license that requires us to pay substantial royalties or relocate our manufacturing facilities. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline.\nOUR PRODUCTS RELY ON LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE LOSE ACCESS TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES, OUR REVENUES COULD DECLINE.\nWe rely on technology that we license from others, including technology that is integral to our products. There is no assurance that we can obtain licenses on acceptable terms or at all. The license agreements we have entered into with several industry partners may be terminated for breach. If any of these agreements are terminated, we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms or at all. The failure to obtain or maintain the licenses could prevent or delay further development or commercialization of our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE BELOW SECURITIES ANALYSTS\u2019 OR INVESTORS\u2019 EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.\nDue to the nascent nature of our industry, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business. The revenue and income potential of our market are unproven, and we may be unable to maintain or grow our revenue. Our products typically have lengthy sales cycles. In addition, our costs may be higher than we anticipated. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to forecast, because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving. Our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u2022the extent to which our products achieve and maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022actions relating to regulatory matters;\n\u2022product quality and supply problems;\n\u2022our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022demand for our products;\n\u2022the size and timing of particular sales and any collection delays related to those sales;\n\u2022the progress of surgical training in the use of our products;\n\u2022our ability to develop, introduce, and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022third-party payor reimbursement policies;\n\u2022our ability to protect our proprietary rights and defend against third-party challenges;\n\u2022our ability to license additional intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022the progress and results of any clinical trials.\nOur operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable indication of our future performance. It is possible that, in future periods, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock and the value of your investment will likely decline.\nOUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate significantly in the future. For example, during 2019, it reached a high of $199.60 and a low of $150.08; during 2020, it reached a high of $272.70 and a low of $122.58; and during 2021, it reached a high of $365.42 and a low of $228.30. Our stock price can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022announcements about us or our competitors;\n\u2022variations in operating results and financial guidance;\n\u2022introduction or abandonment of new technologies or products;\n\u2022regulatory approvals and enforcement actions;\n\u2022changes in product pricing policies;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022changes in accounting policies;\n\u2022economic changes and overall market volatility;\n\u2022announcements relating to product quality and the supply chain for our products;\n\u2022litigation;\n\u2022media coverage, whether accurate or inaccurate, fair or misleading;\n\u2022political uncertainties;\n\u2022short sales on shares of our common stock or other activities by short sellers; and\n\u2022our stock repurchase program.\nIn addition, stock markets generally have experienced, and in the future may experience significant price and volume volatility. This volatility has a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies. Further, the securities of many medical device companies, including us, have historically been subject to extensive price and volume fluctuations that may affect the market price of their common stock. If these broad market fluctuations continue, it may have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nCHANGES TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing standards or the reevaluation of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.", "PERMNO": 88352, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ISRG"}
