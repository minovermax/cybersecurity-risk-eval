{"cik": "872912", "company": "DELCATH SYSTEMS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Condition\nAn investment in our securities involve a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this annual report, before you decide to purchase our securities. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. In that event, the trading price of our common stock and the market value of the securities offered hereby could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nDrug development is an inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development. Delcath received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding our Melphalan/HDS Kit system, declining to approve our existing New Drug Application, or NDA, in its current form.\nPreclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of clinical development. Drug development is very risky, and it takes several years to complete clinical trials. The start or end of a clinical trial is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator treatment or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes including insufficient efficacy, safety concerns, or our own financial constraints.\nIn response to our New Drug Application (NDA), which the Company submitted to FDA in August 2012 seeking approval for use of our Melphalan/HDS Kit for the treatment of patients with ocular melanoma of the liver, in September 2013, the FDA denied approval of the NDA in its current form and issued a complete response letter (CRL). A CRL is issued by the FDA when the review of a file is completed, and questions remain that preclude approval of the NDA in its current form. The FDA comments in the CRL included, but were not limited to, a statement that Delcath must perform additional \u201cwell-controlled randomized trial(s) to establish the safety and efficacy of Melphalan/HDS Kit using overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome measure\u201d and which \u201cdemonstrates that the clinical benefits of Melphalan/HDS Kit outweigh its risks.\u201d The FDA also required that the additional clinical trial(s) be conducted using the product the company intends to market. Prior to conducting additional clinical trials, Delcath must satisfy certain other requirements of the CRL, including, but not limited to, product quality testing and human factors. Further, in January 2016 Delcath received agreement on a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) from the FDA and has initiated a pivotal Phase 3 overall survival clinical trial in ocular melanoma liver metastases.\nA SPA is a process whereby a sponsor and FDA reach agreement on clinical trials and protocol elements, as well as planned analyses. While a SPA agreement is not a guarantee that FDA will accept a NDA for filing or that the clinical trial design and results will be adequate to support approval it is hoped that clinical trial quality will be improved.\nIn addition, Delcath conducts and participates in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints to support additional indications for Melphalan/HDS Kit and HDS with other drug therapies. In 2014, Delcath initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial with Melphalan/HDS Kit for HCC in both the United States and Europe. In 2015, the Phase 2 clinical trial for HCC was expanded to include a cohort of patients with ICC. The trial for this cohort will be conducted at the same centers participating in the Phase 2 HCC trial. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from clinical trials, including the Phase 2 clinical trial for HCC, the market\u2019s perception of this clinical data or FDA\u2019s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain approval, and the financial condition. Additionally, even if the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial for HCC and ICC are positive, there is a substantial risk that it will fail to have positive results in Phase 3 clinical trials with regard to efficacy, safety or other clinical outcomes and may never obtain regulatory approval.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm issued a report dated March 16, 2018 in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2017, which included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our notes to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a disclosure describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital and/or enter into strategic alliances when needed or on attractive terms, Delcath would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or any commercialization efforts. The Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is likely that holders of its common stock will lose all of their investment.\nThe Company does not expect to generate significant revenue for the foreseeable future.\nDelcath\u2019s entire focus has been on developing, commercializing, and obtaining regulatory authorizations and approvals of CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS and currently has only developed this system for the treatment of cancers in the liver. If CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS for the treatment of cancers in the liver fails as a commercial product, the Company has no other products to sell. In addition, since CHEMOSAT is currently only authorized for marketing in the EEA and limited other jurisdictions, if Delcath is unsuccessful in commercializing the product in the EEA and if Melphalan/HDS is not approved in the United States and elsewhere, there will be no means of generating revenue. In September 2013, the FDA issued a CRL with respect to the Company\u2019s NDA for Melphalan/HDS. A CRL is issued by the FDA when the review of a file is completed and questions remain that preclude approval of the NDA in its then current form. Accordingly, Delcath does not expect to realize any revenues from product sales in the United States in the next several years, if at all. As a result, our revenue sources are, and will remain, extremely limited until the\nCompany\u2019s product candidates are approved by the FDA or other additional foreign regulatory agencies and successfully marketed. CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS may not be successful in clinical trials, approved by the FDA or other additional foreign regulatory agency or marketed at any time in the foreseeable future or at all.\nContinuing losses may exhaust our capital resources.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $4.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Delcath has had minimal revenue to date, and has a substantial accumulated deficit, recurring operating losses and negative cash flow. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred net losses of approximately $45.1 million, $18.0 million and $14.7 million, respectively and expects to continue to incur losses in 2018. Management believes its capital resources are adequate to fund operations through May 2018. To date, the Company has funded operations through a combination of private placements and public offerings of its securities, including convertible notes. If Delcath continues to incur losses, the Company may exhaust its capital resources, and as a result may be unable to complete its clinical trials, product development, regulatory approval process and commercialization of CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS or any other versions of the system. If Delcath is unable to raise capital or generate sufficient revenue, it may not be able to pay its debts when they become due and may have to seek protection from the bankruptcy courts or enter into a receivership.\nIf the Company cannot raise additional capital, its potential to generate future revenues will be significantly limited since it may not be able to further commercialize CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS, complete its clinical trials or conduct future development and clinical trials.\nThe Company will require additional financing to complete its clinical trial program or seek other approvals, to conduct future development and clinical trials and to further commercialize its product in the EEA and any other markets where the Company may receive approval for its system. In addition, Delcath is obligated to make payments under long-term research and development obligations and lease agreements. If financing is unavailable to make the required payments under these agreements, the Company could be subject to legal liability and its ability to complete development projects or clinical trials could be impaired. The Company does not know if additional financing will be available when needed at all or on acceptable terms. If unable to obtain additional financing as needed, the Company may not be able to commercialize CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS, obtain regulatory approvals or complete its development projects or clinical trials, which would result in a complete loss of your investment.\nOur liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nclinical studies, including a Phase 3 clinical trial to investigate overall survival in ocular melanoma liver metastases and a registration trial in ICC;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs of our various United States and foreign regulatory filings, obtaining approvals and complying with regulations;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs associated with developing our manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of product commercialization activities, including marketing and distribution arrangements overseas;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of competing technological and market developments.\nInsufficient funds may require us to curtail or stop our commercialization activities, regulatory submissions or ongoing activities for regulatory approval, research and development and clinical trials, which will significantly limit our potential to generate future revenues.\nRisks Related to FDA and Foreign Regulatory Approval\nOur failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS is subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Failure to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to either civil or criminal administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions and/or other penalties.\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. Melphalan/HDS is subject to regulation by the FDA as a combination product, which means it is composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would therefore be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its pre-market review and regulation based on a determination of the product\u2019s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of Melphalan/HDS, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over its pre-market development and review.\nThe Company is not permitted to market Melphalan/HDS in the United States unless and until it obtains regulatory approval from the FDA. To market the product in the United States, Delcath must submit to the FDA and obtain FDA approval of an NDA. An NDA must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the applicable product candidate. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. Despite the time and expense associated with preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and the Company could encounter problems that cause it to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies, CMC studies or clinical trials. The FDA and similar foreign authorities could delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including because they:\n\u2022\nmay not deem a product candidate to be adequately safe and effective;\n\u2022\nmay not find the data from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials to be sufficient to support a claim of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nmay interpret data from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials significantly differently than the Company;\n\u2022\nmay not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nmay change approval policies (including with respect to our product candidates\u2019 class of drugs) or adopt new regulations; or\n\u2022\nmay not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any product candidate that Delcath develops could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or cause us to evaluate the future of our development programs. The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain. As part of the U.S. Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal to review and act on a percentage of all submissions in a given time frame. In August 2012, the Company submitted the Melphalan/HDS NDA seeking an indication for ocular melanoma liver metastases. In September 2013, the FDA declined to approve the NDA and issued a CRL. The FDA comments in the CRL included, but were not limited to, a statement that the Company must perform additional \u201cwell-controlled randomized trial(s) to establish the safety and efficacy of Melphalan/HDS using overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome measure\u201d and which \u201cdemonstrates that the clinical benefits of Melphalan/HDS outweigh its risks.\u201d The FDA also requires that the additional clinical trial(s) be conducted using the product the Company intends to market. Prior to conducting additional clinical trials, Delcath must satisfy certain other requirements of the CRL, including, but not limited to, product quality testing and human factors. However, even if the Company completes its clinical trials and satisfies all the requirements of the CRL, it may not obtain regulatory approval from the FDA. Continued failure to obtain, or additional delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the commercialization of the current version of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS or any products that the Company develops in the future;\n\u2022\nimpose additional costs on Delcath;\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that may be attained; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues.\nDeclath has obtained the right to affix the CE Mark for the Delcath Hepatic CHEMOSAT Delivery System as a medical device for the delivery of melphalan. Since the Company may only promote the device within this specific indication, if physicians are unwilling to obtain melphalan separately for use with CHEMOSAT, Delcath\u2019s ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT in the EEA will be significantly limited.\nIn the EEA, CHEMOSAT is regulated as a Class IIb medical device indicated for the intra-arterial administration of a chemotherapeutic agent, melphalan hydrochloride, to the liver with additional extracorporeal filtration of the venous blood return. Delcath\u2019s ability to market and promote CHEMOSAT is limited to this approved indication. To the extent that the Company\u2019s promotion of CHEMOSAT is found to be outside the scope of its approved indication, Delcath may be subject to fines or other regulatory action, limiting its ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT in the EEA.\nThe Company is limited to marketing CHEMOSAT in the EEA as a medical device for the delivery of melphalan. If physicians are unwilling to obtain melphalan separately for use with CHEMOSAT, Delcath\u2019s ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT in the EEA will be significantly limited. Delcath\u2019s product instructions and indication reference the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan. However, no melphalan labels in the EEA reference Delcath\u2019s product, and the labels vary from country to country with respect to the approved indication of the drug and its mode of administration. As a result, the delivery of melphalan with Delcath\u2019s device may not be within the applicable label with respect to some indications in some Member States of the EEA where the drugs are authorized for marketing. Physicians intending to use CHEMOSAT must obtain melphalan separately for use with CHEMOSAT and must use melphalan independently at their discretion. If physicians are unwilling to obtain melphalan separately from CHEMOSAT and/or to prescribe the use of melphalan independently, the Company\u2019s sales opportunities in the EEA will be significantly impaired.\nWhile the Company has obtained the right to affix the CE Mark, it will be subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight in the EEA and in any other country where it receives marketing authorization or approval.\nIn April 2012, the Company obtained the required certification from its European Notified Body, enabling Delcath to complete an EC Declaration of Conformity with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive and affix the CE Mark to the Generation Two CHEMOSAT system. In order to maintain the right to affix the CE Mark in the EEA, the Company is subject to compliance obligations, and any material changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes, product improvements or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review. Additionally, the Company is subject to ongoing audits by its European Notified Body, and the right to affix the CE Mark to the Generation Two CHEMOSAT system may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product.\nTo the extent that CHEMOSAT or Melphalan/HDS is approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, Delcath will be subject to similar ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight in those countries where approval is obtained. For example, the Company may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA approves a product candidate, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs, good clinical practices (GCPs), and good laboratory practices, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all products in clinical development, for any clinical trials that the Company conducts post-approval. In addition, post-marketing requirements for CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS may include implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) program to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS may include a Medication Guide, a patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare professionals and/or other elements to assure safe use of the product.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrefusals or delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nrefusal of a regulatory authority to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls or seizures;\n\u2022\nfines, Warning Letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nimport or export restrictions;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product administration, requirements for additional clinical trials or changes to product labeling or REMS programs; or\n\u2022\nrecommendations by regulatory authorities against entering into governmental contracts with us.\nIf the Company is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, it may lose any marketing approval that it may have obtained and may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe development and approval process in the United States will take many years, require substantial resources and may never lead to the approval of Melphalan/HDS by the FDA for use in the United States.\nThe Company cannot sell or market Melphalan/HDS with melphalan or other chemotherapeutic agents in the United States without prior FDA approval of an NDA for Melphalan/HDS. Although melphalan and other drugs have been approved by the FDA for use as chemotherapeutic agents, regulatory approval is required in the United States for the combined medical device component and drug component and the specific indication, dose and route of administration of melphalan or other chemotherapeutic agent used in our system. The Company is seeking approval of Melphalan/HDS for a substantially higher dose of melphalan than prior approved doses of melphalan and such other drugs. Delcath must obtain separate regulatory approvals for Melphalan/HDS with melphalan and every other chemotherapeutic agent or other compound used with the system that Delcath intends to market, and all the manufacturing facilities used to manufacture components or assemble our system must be inspected and meet legal requirements. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the product\u2019s safety, efficacy, potency and purity for each intended use. The pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of Melphalan/HDS with melphalan or any other chemotherapeutic agent or compound the Company uses in its system must comply with the regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local government authorities in the United States. Clinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays. Delcath may encounter delays or rejections for various reasons, including its inability to enroll enough patients to complete the clinical trials. Moreover, approval policies or regulations may change. If the Company does not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its system and the use of melphalan or other chemotherapeutic agents, the value of the Company, results of operations and its ability to raise additional capital will be harmed.\nIn August 2012, Delcath submitted a NDA seeking an indication for ocular melanoma liver metastases for our Melphalan/HDS. In September 2013, the FDA issued a CRL. The FDA comments in the CRL included a statement that the Company must perform additional well-controlled randomized trial(s) to establish the safety and efficacy of Melphalan/HDS using overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome measure and which demonstrates that the clinical benefits of Melphalan/HDS outweigh its risks. Failure to obtain FDA approval will have a material adverse effect on Delcath\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if the Company obtains regulatory approval for the Melphalan/HDS system in the United States, its ability to market the Melphalan/HDS system would be limited to those uses that are approved.\nThe FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. If the FDA approves an application for the Melphalan/HDS, our ability to market and promote the Melphalan/HDS would be limited to the approved indication, so even with FDA approval, the Melphalan/HDS system may only be promoted in this limited market. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use, and FDA approval may otherwise limit our sales practices and our ability to promote, sell and distribute the product. Thus, the Company may only market the Melphalan/HDS, if approved by the FDA, for its approved indication and could be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, Delcath may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the development of additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, Warning Letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.\nIf future clinical trials are unsuccessful, significantly delayed or not completed, the Company may not be able to market Melphalan/HDS for other indications.\nThe clinical trial data on our product is limited to specific types of liver cancer. In 2010, the Company concluded a Phase 3 clinical trial of Melphalan/HDS in patients with metastatic ocular and cutaneous melanoma to the liver and also completed a multi-arm Phase 2 clinical trial of Melphalan/HDS in patients with primary and metastatic melanoma stratified into four arms.\nIn January 2016 the Company received agreement on a SPA from the FDA and has initiated a pivotal Phase 3 overall survival clinical trial in ocular melanoma liver metastases. In March 2017, Delcath received agreement on a SPA from the FDA for a registration trial to treat patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a trial the Company expects to initiate when financial resources permit.\nIt may take several years to complete the testing of Melphalan/HDS for use in the treatment of these indications, and failure can occur at any stage of development, for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nany pre-clinical or clinical test may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\npre-clinical or clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from a pre-clinical study or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a pre-clinical study or clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities can place a clinical hold on a trial if, among other reasons, it finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury;\n\u2022\nDelcath may encounter delays or rejections based on changes in regulatory agency policies during the period in which it is developing a system or the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any system or result in marketable products;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may request additional clinical trials, including an additional Phase 3 trial, relating to the Company\u2019s NDA submissions;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations that may negatively affect or delay Delcath\u2019s ability to bring a system to market or require additional clinical trials; and\n\u2022\na system may not be approved for all the requested indications.\nThe failure or delay of clinical trials could cause an increase in the cost of product development, delay filing of an application for marketing approval or cause the Company to cease the development of Melphalan/HDS for other indications. If Delcath is unable to develop Melphalan/HDS for other indications the future growth of our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, Delcath has limited clinical data relating to the effectiveness of Melphalan/HDS in certain types of cancer. Such limited data could slow the adoption of CHEMOSAT/ Melphalan/HDS and significantly reduce Delcath\u2019s ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT/ Melphalan/HDS.\nThe Company relies on third parties to conduct certain elements of the clinical trials for CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS, and if they do not perform their obligations to Delcath, the Company may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for its system.\nThe Company designs the clinical trials for Melphalan/HDS, but relies on academic institutions, corporate partners, contract research organizations and other third parties to assist in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out these trials. Delcath relies heavily on these parties for the execution of its clinical studies and control only certain aspects of their activities. Accordingly, the Company may have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if Delcath conducted them entirely on their own. The Company relies upon third parties to conduct monitoring and data collection of its ongoing and future clinical trials, including its Phase 3 ocular melanoma trial and pivotal ICC trial. Although Delcath relies on these third parties to manage the data from these clinical trials and are responsible for confirming that each of its clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require Delcath to comply with GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA enforces these GCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. The Company\u2019s reliance on third parties does not relieve it of these responsibilities and requirements, and if Delcath or the third parties upon whom the Company relies for its clinical trials fail to comply with the applicable GCPs, the data generated in its clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies may require Delcath to perform additional trials before approving our marketing application. The Company cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of its clinical trials comply or complied with GCPs. In addition, Delcath\u2019s clinical trials must be conducted with product that complies with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with these regulations may require it to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process, and may result in a failure to obtain regulatory approval for Melphalan/HDS if these requirements are not met.\nPurchasers of CHEMOSAT in the EEA may not receive third-party reimbursement or such reimbursement may be inadequate. Without adequate reimbursement, Delcath may not be able to successfully commercialize CHEMOSAT in the EEA.\nThe Company has obtained the right to affix the CE Mark for CHEMOSAT, and Delcath intends to seek third-party or government reimbursement within those countries in the EEA where it expects to market and sell CHEMOSAT. In Germany, the Company has received a ZE diagnostic-related group code, which permits hospitals in Germany to obtain reimbursement for CHEMOSAT procedures beginning in 2016. Negotiations on the amount of reimbursement to be received under the code were concluded in 2016 and the procedure is reimbursed under this system in 2017. The ZE system is an annual process and negotiations are underway to set reimbursement levels for 2018. Consequently, reimbursement obtained may not be for the full amount sought. In countries where Delcath is able to obtain reimbursement, local policy could limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain adequate and consistent reimbursement and limit other sales opportunities in those countries.\nIn other countries, until Delcath obtains government reimbursement, it will rely on private payors or local pre-approved funds where available. New technology payment programs may provide interim funding, but there are no assurances that Delcath will qualify for such funding. Even if the Company does qualify, the amount and the duration of this funding may be limited. There are also no assurances that third-party payors or government health agencies of Member States of the EEA will reimburse the product\u2019s use in the long term or at all. Further, each country has its own protocols regarding reimbursement, so successfully obtaining third party or government health agency reimbursement in one country does not necessarily translate to similar reimbursement in other EEA countries. Physicians, hospitals and other health care providers may be reluctant to purchase CHEMOSAT if they do not receive substantial reimbursement for the cost of using the product from third-party payors or government entities. The lack of adequate reimbursement may significantly limit sales opportunities in the EEA.\nThe success of our products may be harmed if the government, private health insurers and other third-party payers do not provide sufficient coverage or reimbursement.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to commercialize its system successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Melphalan/HDS is currently not approved by the FDA. Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance plans and their foreign equivalents will not reimburse the use of Melphalan/HDS since the product is currently not approved outside the EEA. Delcath will seek reimbursement by third-party payors of the cost of Melphalan/HDS after its use is approved, but there are no assurances that adequate third-party coverage will be available for Delcath to establish and maintain price levels sufficient for the Company to realize an appropriate return on its investment in developing new therapies. Government, private health insurers and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing. Accordingly, even if coverage and reimbursement are provided by government, private health insurers and third-party payors for uses of our products, market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected if the reimbursement available proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers.\nImplementation of healthcare reforms in the United States and in significant overseas markets may limit the ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT/ Melphalan/HDS and the demand for CHEMOSAT/ Melphalan/HDS. Healthcare providers may respond to such cost-containment pressures by choosing lower cost products or other therapies. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (ACA) were enacted into law in the United States, which included a number of provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs. The President and members of Congress have recently introduced legislative proposals to significantly alter the ACA. It is uncertain if such proposals will be enacted or what consequences these proposals or the implementation of existing provisions will have on our efforts to commercialize CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS.\nCHEMOSAT/ Melphalan/HDS may not achieve sufficient acceptance by the medical community to sustain our business.\nThe commercial success of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS will depend upon its acceptance by the medical community and third-party payers as clinically useful, cost effective and safe. Acceptance by the medical community may depend on the extent to which leaders in the scientific and medical communities publish scientific papers in reputable academic journals. If testing and clinical practice do not confirm the safety and efficacy of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS or even if further testing and clinical practice produce positive results but the medical community does not view these favorably, and CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS as effective and desirable, our efforts to market CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS may fail, which would cause us to cease operation.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the medical device industry. Group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts in the United States and foreign markets may result in a consolidation of purchasing decisions for potential healthcare provider customers. The Company expects that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the price of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS is not used in accordance with established payor protocols regarding cost effective treatment methods or is used outside its approved indication or for forms of cancer or with drugs not specifically approved by the FDA or other foreign regulatory bodies in the future. Without reimbursement, physicians, hospitals and other health care providers will be less likely to purchase CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS, thereby harming our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing, Commercialization and Market Acceptance of the CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS\nThere are three third-party manufacturers of melphalan in certain countries of the EEA of which the Company is aware. If any of these manufacturers fails to provide end-users with adequate supplies of melphalan or fails to comply with the requirements of regulatory authorities, Delcath may be unable to successfully commercialize our product in the EEA.\nUnder the current regulatory scheme in the EEA, CHEMOSAT is approved for marketing as a device only, and doctors will separately obtain melphalan for use with CHEMOSAT. Although melphalan has been approved in the EEA for over a decade, the Company is aware that there are currently three approved manufacturers of melphalan in certain countries of the EEA. As a result, there may not be sufficient supply of melphalan for use with its system, and any adverse change in the sole manufacturer\u2019s commercial operations or regulatory approval status may seriously impair Delcath\u2019s sales opportunities in the EEA. Additionally, melphalan is not available in certain foreign countries outside the EEA where Delcath may seek to market CHEMOSAT. If supply of melphalan remains limited or unavailable, the Company will be unable to commercialize our product in these markets, thereby limiting future sales opportunities.\nIf the Company cannot maintain or enter into acceptable arrangements for the production of melphalan and other chemotherapeutic agents it will be unable to successfully commercialize the Delcath system in the United States or complete its global Phase 3 in ocular melanoma liver metastases, registration trial in ICC, or any future clinical trials.\nThe Company has entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Synerx Pharma, LLC (Synerx) and Bioniche Teoranta (Bioniche) an affiliate of Mylan, Inc., for the supply of its branded melphalan for injection. The agreement with Synerx and Bioniche currently represents Delcath\u2019s sole source of branded melphalan in the United States. The Company intends to use the melphalan supplied by Synerx and Bioniche to conduct its global Phase 3 trials for ocular melanoma liver metastases and ICC. Delcath may pursue agreements with additional contract manufacturers to produce melphalan and other chemotherapeutic agents that it will use in the future for its clinical trial program and the commercialization of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS, as well as for labeling and finishing services. The Company may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. To manufacture melphalan or other chemotherapeutic agents on its own, Delcath would first have to develop a manufacturing facility that complies with FDA requirements and regulations for the production of melphalan and each other chemotherapeutic agent the Company chooses to manufacture for its system. Developing these resources would be an expensive and lengthy process and would have a material adverse effect on its revenues and profitability. If Delcath is unable to obtain sufficient melphalan and labeling services on acceptable terms, if it should encounter delays or difficulties in its relationships with current and future suppliers or if current and future suppliers of melphalan do not comply with applicable regulations for the manufacturing and production of melphalan, Delcath\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nIf we cannot successfully manufacture CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS, our ability to develop and commercialize the system would be impaired.\nWe manufacture CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS for distribution worldwide in our Queensbury, NY facility. We have a limited manufacturing history and we may not be able to manufacture the system in sufficient commercial quantities, in a cost-effective manner or in compliance with the regulatory requirements applicable to such manufacturing. Additionally, we may have difficulty obtaining components for the system from our third-party suppliers in a timely manner or at all which may adversely affect our ability to deliver CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS to purchasers.\nIn addition to limiting sales opportunities, delays in manufacturing CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval in other jurisdictions. Our ability to conduct timely clinical trials in the United States and abroad depends on our ability to manufacture the system, including sourcing the chemotherapeutic agents or other compounds through third parties in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. If we are unable to manufacture CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS in a timely manner, we may not be able to conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product.\nIf our Queensbury, NY facility fails to maintain compliance with ISO 13485, a comprehensive management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices, and FDA cGMP or fails to pass facility inspection or audits, our ability to manufacture at the facility could be limited or terminated. In the future, we may manufacture and assemble CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS in the EEA, and any facilities in the EEA would have to obtain and maintain similar approvals or certifications of compliance.\nThe Company does not have written contracts with all of its suppliers for the manufacture of components for CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS.\nThe Company does not have written contracts with all suppliers for the manufacture of components for CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS. If Delcath is unable to obtain an adequate supply of the necessary components or negotiate acceptable terms, it may not be able to manufacture the system in commercial quantities or in a cost-effective manner, and commercialization of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS in the EEA may be delayed. In addition, certain components are available from only a limited number of sources.\nComponents of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS are currently manufactured for Delcath in small quantities and may require significantly greater quantities to further commercialize the product. The Company may not be able to find alternate sources of comparable components. If Delcath is unable to obtain adequate supplies of components from existing suppliers or needs to switch to an alternate supplier and obtain FDA or other regulatory agency approval of that supplier, commercialization of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS may be delayed.\nThe Company has limited experience in marketing and commercializing its products, and as a result, may not be successful in commercializing CHEMOSAT in the EEA.\nThe Company has not previously sold, marketed or distributed any products and have limited experience in building a sales and marketing organization and in entering into and managing relationships with third-party distributors. Even though Delcath has obtained the right to affix the CE Mark, it currently has limited sales, marketing, commercial or distribution capabilities in any countries in the EEA. In order to pursue the Company\u2019s strategy to commercialize CHEMOSAT in the EEA, Delcath must acquire or internally develop a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and/or enter into strategic alliances to perform these services. The development of sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure is difficult, time consuming and requires substantial financial and other resources. If Delcath cannot successfully develop the infrastructure to market and commercialize CHEMOSAT, its ability to generate revenues in the EEA may be harmed, and Delcath may not generate sufficient revenue to sustain its business or may be required to enter into strategic alliances to have such activities carried out on its behalf, which may not be on favorable terms.\nCompetition for sales and marketing personnel is intense, and Delcath may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain skilled sales and marketing personnel or to reach an agreement with a third party could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, since Delcath\u2019s marketing strategy in the EEA includes establishing a network of third-party distributors, the Company must enter into collaborative arrangements with these third-party distributors. The Company may not be able to enter into such arrangements on reasonable terms or at all.\nEven if the Company receives FDA or other foreign regulatory approvals, Delcath may be unsuccessful in commercializing CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS in markets outside the EEA, because of inadequate infrastructure or an ineffective commercialization strategy.\nOutside the EEA, even if the Company obtains regulatory approval from the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, its ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS may be limited due to Delcath\u2019s inexperience in developing a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure. If the Company is unable to develop this infrastructure in the United States or elsewhere or to collaborate with an alliance partner to market its products in the United States or foreign countries, particularly in Asia, Delcath\u2019s efforts to commercialize CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS or any other product outside of the EEA may be less successful.\nEven if the Company is successful in commercializing CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS in the EEA, Delcath may not be successful in the United States and other foreign countries. Each country requires a different commercialization strategy, so the Company\u2019s EEA strategy may not translate to other markets. Without a successful commercialization strategy tailored for each market, Delcath\u2019s efforts to promote and market CHEMOSAT in each of its target markets may fail in any or all of those markets.\nThe Company\u2019s plan to use collaborative arrangements with third parties to help finance and to market and sell CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS may not be successful.\nThe Company may be unable to enter into collaborative agreements without additional clinical data or unable to continue a collaborative agreement as a result of unsuccessful future clinical trials. Additionally, Delcath may face competition in its search for alliances. As a result, the Company may not be able to enter into any additional alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. The Company\u2019s collaborative relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS or any other product. The success of any collaboration will depend upon Delcath\u2019s ability to perform its obligations under any agreements as well as factors beyond its control, such as the commitment of its collaborators and the timely performance of their obligations. The terms of any such collaboration may permit Delcath\u2019s collaborators to abandon the alliance at any time for any reason or prevent us from terminating arrangements with collaborators who do not perform in accordance with the Company\u2019s expectations or its collaborators may breach their agreements with the Company. In addition, any third parties with which the Company collaborates may have significant control over important aspects of the development and commercialization of its products, including research and development, market identification, marketing methods, pricing, composition of sales force and promotional activities. Delcath is not able to control or influence the amount and timing of resources that any collaborator may devote to the Company\u2019s research and development programs or the commercialization, marketing or distribution of its products. The Company may not be able to prevent any collaborators from pursuing alternative technologies or products that could result in the development of products that compete with CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS or the withdrawal of their support for its products. The failure of any such collaboration could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nIf the Company fails to overcome the challenges inherent in international operations, its business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nCurrently the Company has only received authorization to market CHEMOSAT in the EEA, and intends to seek similar authorization or approvals in other foreign countries. As a result, Delcath expects international sales of its products to account for a significant portion of its revenue, which exposes Delcath to risks inherent in international operations. To accommodate the Company\u2019s international sales, Delcath will need to further invest financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure that will meet the needs of its customers. Accordingly, Delcath will face additional risks resulting from its international operations including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables in a timely manner through the legal systems of many countries outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe failure to satisfy foreign regulatory requirements to market its products on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022\navailability of, and changes in, reimbursement within prevailing foreign healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing foreign relationships and operations, including any relationships that the Company establishes with foreign sales or marketing employees and agents;\n\u2022\nlimited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax its foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of any material shipping delays;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in the political, regulatory, safety or economic conditions in a country or region;\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors; and\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, including the imposition of, or significant changes to, the level of tariffs, customs duties and export quotas.\nIf the Company fails to overcome the challenges it encounters in its international operations, Delcath\u2019s business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nCHEMOSAT has been used a limited number of times in a clinical setting in the EEA, so market acceptance of CHEMOSAT will depend on EEA healthcare professionals\u2019 efforts to learn about the product.\nSince all of the Company\u2019s prior clinical studies were conducted in the United States and CHEMOSAT has had limited use in a clinical setting in the EEA, physicians in the EEA have limited clinical experience with the product. As a result, CHEMOSAT may not gain significant market acceptance among physicians, hospitals, patients and healthcare payors in the EEA until healthcare professionals are properly educated about the procedure. Market acceptance of CHEMOSAT in the EEA will depend upon a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nwhether future clinical trials demonstrate significantly improved patient outcomes;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to educate and train physicians to perform the procedure and drive acceptance of the use of CHEMOSAT;\n\u2022\nDelcath\u2019s ability to obtain adequate reimbursement and convince healthcare payors that use of CHEMOSAT results in reduced treatment costs and improved outcomes for patients;\n\u2022\nwhether CHEMOSAT replaces and/or complements treatment methods in which many hospitals have made a significant investment; and\n\u2022\nwhether doctors and hospitals are willing to replace their existing technology with a new medical technology until the new technology\u2019s value has been demonstrated.\nThe Company intends to establish clinical training and centers of excellence to educate and train physicians and healthcare payors in the EEA, but the key opinion thought leadership required for initial market acceptance within the healthcare arena may take time to develop. Without effort from healthcare professionals to become educated about Delcath\u2019s product, the market may not accept CHEMOSAT and its efforts to commercialize CHEMOSAT in the EEA may be unsuccessful.\nSimilar considerations apply in any other market where the Company receives approval. Successful commercialization of CHEMOSAT in these markets will depend on market acceptance by healthcare professionals.\nRapid technological developments in treatment methods for liver cancer and competition with other forms of liver cancer treatments could affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve meaningful revenues or profit.\nCompetition in the cancer treatment industry is intense. CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS competes with all forms of liver cancer treatments that are alternatives to the \u201cgold standard\u201d treatment of surgical resection. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources and considerable experience in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals. If these competitors develop more effective or more affordable products or treatment methods, or achieve earlier product development, Delcath\u2019s revenues or profitability will be substantially reduced.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to develop CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS for other indications could affect its orphan drug exclusivity. Delcath has the following six designations:\n\u2022\ntwo orphan drug designations for the drug melphalan for the treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma as well as patients with ocular melanoma (November 2008)\n\u2022\norphan drug designation of the drug melphalan for the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (May 2009)\n\u2022\norphan drug designation of the drug doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer (August 2009)\n\u2022\norphan drug designation of the drug melphalan for the treatment of HCC (October 2013)\n\u2022\norphan drug designation of the drug melphalan or the treatment of ICC(July 2015)\nIf CHEMOSAT and Melphalan/HDS is approved for an indication different than the indications for which Delcath has received orphan drug designations, the Company will not obtain orphan drug exclusivity, which could increase its competition. If another company has orphan drug designations for these same indications and receives marketing approval before Delcath does, then the Company will be blocked from marketing approval for seven years from the date of its approval for the same indication of use.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe loss of a member of the Company\u2019s senior executive staff could harm its business. Competition for experienced personnel is intense. If Delcath cannot retain its current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, Delcath\u2019s ability to compete could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these event may cause us to have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary rights in the technologies and inventions used in or embodied by our product. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality, license and other contractual restrictions in our manufacturing, consulting, employment and other third party agreements. These legal means may afford only limited protection, however, and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage.\nWe have not and may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product and technologies in any or all countries throughout the world could be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from copying our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection that covers the commercial products to develop their own competing products that are the same or substantially the same as our commercial product and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but judicial systems do not adequately enforce patents to cause infringing activities to be ceased.\nWe do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market exists or may exist in the future. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we do have patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our product.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nMoreover, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our product and technologies.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents, which can be an expensive, time consuming, and uncertain process, and the value of the patents is dependent in part on the breadth of coverage and the relationship between the coverage and the commercial product.\nThe patent position of medical drug and device companies is generally highly uncertain. The degree of patent protection we require may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us sufficient exclusivity, or to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nany patents we obtain or license from others in the future may not encompass commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nany patents we obtain or license from others in the future may not be valid or enforceable; and\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable\nThe process of applying for patent protection itself is time consuming and expensive and we cannot assure you that we have prepared or will be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is possible that innovation over the course of development and commercialization may lead to changes in the CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS methods and/or devices that cause such methods and/or devices to fall outside the scope of the patent protection we have obtained and the patent protection we have obtained may become less valuable. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. In addition, our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example, with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. Moreover, we cannot assure you that all of our pending patent applications will issue as patents or that, if issued, they will issue in a form that will be advantageous to us.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS prior to the expiration of our patent protection.\nDue to the uncertainty of the patent prosecution process, there are no guarantees that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent. Even if we are successful in obtaining a patent, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS methods and devices, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such methods and devices.\nWe may in the future become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, or to defend our products against assertion of intellectual property by a third party, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To stop any such infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary. Our intellectual property has not been tested in litigation. There is no assurance that any of our issued patents will be upheld if later challenged or will provide significant protection or commercial advantage. A court may declare our patents invalid or unenforceable, may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question, or may interpret the claims of our patents narrowly, thereby substantially narrowing the scope of patent protection they afford. Because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new medical drugs and devices to the market, the healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable emphasis on patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies. Other parties may challenge patents, patent claims or patent applications licensed or issued to us or may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed.\nIn addition, third parties may initiate legal or administrative proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights, or may allege an ownership right in our patents, as a result of their past employment or consultancy with us. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Competing products may also be sold in other countries in which our patent\ncoverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, alleging our infringement of a competitor\u2019s patents, we could be prevented from marketing our product in one or more foreign countries.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by frequent and extensive intellectual property litigation. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our products and the methods employed in our products are covered by their patents. Although we have performed a search for third-party patents and believe we have adequate defenses available if faced with any allegations that we infringe these third-party patents, it is possible that CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS could be found to infringe these patents. It is also possible that our competitors or potential competitors may have patents, or have applied for, will apply for, or will obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, have made, use, sell, import or export our product. If our products or methods are found to infringe, we could be prevented from manufacturing or marketing our product.\nCompanies in the medical drug/device industry may use intellectual property infringement litigation to gain a competitive advantage. In the United States, patent applications filed in recent years are confidential for 18 months, while older applications are not publicly available until the patent issues. As a result, avoiding patent infringement may be difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or assigned to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from our business. There are no guarantees that we will receive a favorable outcome in any such litigation. If a third party claims that we infringed its patents, any of the following may occur:\n\u2022\nwe may become liable for substantial damages for past infringement if a court decides that our technologies infringe upon a competitor\u2019s patent;\n\u2022\na court may prohibit us from selling or licensing our product without a license from the patent holder, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or which may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents; and\n\u2022\nwe may have to redesign our product so that it does not infringe upon others\u2019 patent rights, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims such as trade secrets, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time-consuming, and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, treble damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees, and could prohibit us from using technologies essential to our product, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our product unless we can obtain licenses to use technology or ideas covered by such patents. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we cannot obtain these licenses, we could be forced to design around those patents at additional cost or abandon the product altogether. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf others have filed patent applications with respect to inventions for which we already have patents issued to us or have patent applications pending, we may be forced to participate in interference or derivation proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could also be costly and could divert our attention from our business. If the USPTO declares an interference and determines that our patent or application is not entitled to a priority date earlier than that of the other patent application, our ability to maintain or obtain those patent rights will be curtailed. Similarly, if the USPTO declares a derivation proceeding and determines that the invention covered by our patent application was derived from another, we will not be able to obtain patent coverage of that invention.\nBecause of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS or any other product can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. Not all of our United States patent rights have corresponding patent rights effective in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. Similar considerations apply in any other country where we are prosecuting patent applications, have been issued patents, or have decided not to pursue patent protection relating to our technology. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do laws of the United States.\nWe maintain a patent license arrangement with a third party, and our future business may depend, in part, upon the maintenance of that arrangement.\nCertain aspects of our next generation products may be covered by United States patents and United States patent applications owned by a third party and exclusively licensed to us. If we breach the terms of the license agreement, the license may be terminated by the licensor. If we do not meet certain commercialization obligations by 2019, the license may be converted to a non-exclusive license by the licensor. We cannot guarantee that the license will not be terminated or converted in the future. Without the patent license we will not be able to prevent others from practicing the technology covered by the licensed patent. Moreover, without the patent license, we may be subject to allegations of patent infringement by the patent owner. We cannot guarantee that the third party will fulfill its responsibilities under the license arrangement.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product and our technologies.\nLegislation introduced earlier this decade increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation, and switch the United States patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. As case law continues to develop in response to this legislation, it is not yet clear what the full impact of the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement, and defense of our patents and applications. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain and enforce or defend additional patent protection in the future.\nOur trademarks may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe rely on our trademarks as one means to distinguish our product from the products of our competitors, and we have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. The USPTO or foreign trademark offices may deny our trademark applications, however, and even if published or registered, these trademarks may be ineffective in protecting our brand and goodwill and may be successfully opposed or challenged. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks. In addition, third parties may use marks that are confusingly similar to our own, which could result in confusion among our customers, thereby weakening the strength of our brand or allowing such third parties to capitalize on our goodwill. In such an event, or if our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our product, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademark rights in the face of any such infringement.\nWe may rely primarily on trade secret protection for important proprietary technologies in the European Economic Area.\nIn addition to patent and trademark protection, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. Specifically in the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on design patent and trade secret protection for CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS. Without utility patent protection in the EEA covering the current version of CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS, CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS will only be covered by design patent and trade secret protection. Unlike patents, trade secrets are only recognized under applicable law if they are kept secret by restricting their disclosure to third parties. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. However, certain consultants and third parties with whom we have business relationships, and to whom in some cases we have disclosed trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge, may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry, including companies, universities and research organizations that are developing competing products. In addition, some of our former employees who were exposed to certain of our trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge in the course of their employment may seek employment with, and become employed by, our competitors. We cannot be assured that consultants, employees and other third parties with whom we have entered into confidentiality agreements will not breach the terms of such agreements by improperly using or disclosing our trade secrets or other proprietary knowledge. Monitoring unauthorized uses\nand disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nTrade secret protection does not prevent independent discovery of the technology or proprietary information or use of the same. Competitors may independently duplicate or exceed our technology in whole or in part. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If we are not successful in maintaining the confidentiality of our technology, the loss of trade secret protection or know-how relating to CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS will significantly impair our ability to commercialize CHEMOSAT in the EEA, and our value and results of operations will be harmed. In particular, we rely on trade secret protection for the filter media, which is a key component of our system.\nSimilar considerations apply in other foreign countries not mentioned above in the Intellectual Property and Other Rights section where we receive approval. Since we do not have issued patents for the current version of CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS in these countries, our ability to successfully commercialize CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS will depend on our ability to maintain trade secret protection in these markets.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers, competitors, or other third parties. Although we endeavor to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of a former employer or competitor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our product, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers or other third parties. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our product may prevent us from selling our product. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our product.\nRisks Related to Products Liability\nThe Company may be the subject of product liability claims or product recalls, and it may be unable to maintain insurance adequate to cover potential liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s business exposes Delcath to potential liability risks that may arise from clinical trials and the testing, manufacture, marketing, sale and use of CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS. In addition, because CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS is intended for use in patients with cancer, there is an increased risk of death among the patients treated with Delcath\u2019s system which may increase the risk of product liability lawsuits related to clinical trials or commercial sales. The Company may be subject to claims against it even if the injury is due to the actions of others. For example, if the medical personnel that use Delcath\u2019s system on patients are not properly trained or are negligent in the use of the system, the patient may be injured, which may subject Delcath to claims. Were such a claim asserted, the Company would likely incur substantial legal and related expenses even if Delcath prevails on the merits. Claims for damages, whether or not successful, could cause delays in clinical trials and result in the loss of physician endorsement, adverse publicity and/or limit the Company\u2019s ability to market and sell the system, resulting in loss of revenue. In addition, it may be necessary for Delcath to recall products that do not meet approved specifications, which would also result in adverse publicity, as well as resulting in costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue. A successful products liability claim or product recall would have a material adverse effect on Delcath\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company currently carries product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage, but it may be insufficient to cover one or more large claims.\nRisks Related to Delcath\u2019s Common Stock\nThe market price of Delcath common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe trading price for Delcath\u2019s common stock has been, and the Company expects it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which Delcath\u2019s common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including historical and anticipated operating results, the Company\u2019s financial situation, announcements of technological innovations or new products by Delcath or its competitors, its ability or inability to raise the additional capital needed and the terms on which it may be raised, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of Delcath\u2019s common stock and affect the volume of trading, regardless of the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. Among the factors that may cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in quarterly operating results or the operating results of competitors;\n\u2022\nvariance in financial performance from the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of its markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;\n\u2022\nfailure of its products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the markets served;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing policies or the pricing policies of competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;\n\u2022\nthe commencement or outcome of litigation involving Delcath, its general industry or both;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nactual or expected sales of common stock by stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of Delcath\u2019s common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets, in general, the OTCQB and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in Delcath\u2019s common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of its business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of Delcath\u2019s common stock and expose it to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe exercise price and number of certain outstanding warrants may be adjusted in future offerings.\nThe 7.0 million warrants issued in the Company\u2019s February 2015, July 2015 and October 2016 offerings, and in transactions signed in October and November 2017 are subject to an exercise price adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations or similar events affecting Delcath\u2019s common stock. The exercise price of the warrants is also subject to anti-dilution adjustments for any issuance of common stock or rights to acquire common stock for consideration per share less than the exercise price of the warrants. In addition to the potential dilutive effect of this provision, there is the potential that a large number of the shares may be sold in the public market at any given time, which could place additional downward pressure on the trading price of Delcath\u2019s common stock.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, or from issuing securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. As of March 16, 2018, the Company had an aggregate of 500 million shares of common stock authorized and of that 58.0 million not issued or outstanding, including 38.0 million pre-funded warrants and 7.0 million shares issuable upon the exercise of the outstanding warrants at a weighted average price of $0.61. The Company may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by its shareholders. Delcath may expand its business through complementary or strategic business combinations or acquisitions of other companies and assets, and may issue shares of common stock in connection with those transactions. The market price of Delcath\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of the issuance of a large number of shares of common stock, particularly if the per share consideration received for the stock issued is less than the per share book value of Delcath\u2019s common stock or if the Company is not expected to be able to generate earnings with the proceeds of the issuance that are as great as the earnings per share generated before the issuance of the additional shares. In addition, any shares issued in connection with these activities, the exercise of warrants or stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by investors. The Company cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price of its common stock.\nThe Company has a history of reverse splits, which have severely impacted its common stock price.\nSince Delcath\u2019s initial public offering in 2000, it has executed three reverse stock splits, for a cumulative ratio since its IPO of 1:89,600. Each such reverse split has resulted in an effective decline in the price of Delcath\u2019s common stock. For example, the most recent reverse split of 1:350 was effected on November 6, 2017, resulting in an opening price of $10.50. By November 30, 2017, Delcath\u2019s common stock closed at $0.09 and has continued to decline. As part of the offer of Series D warrants in February 2018, the Company is obligated to seek stockholder approval for both an increase in the number of authorized shares and a further reverse stock split in a ratio to be approved by its shareholders. There can be no assurance that such reverse split will not result in a further significant diminution of the value of Delcath\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company does not have sufficient shares of common stock authorized to exercise the Series D warrants.\nThe Company currently has 500 million shares of its common stock authorized for issuance under its Certificate of Incorporation and approximately 435 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Series D warrants, in the aggregate, require reservation of 500 million shares of common stock for issuance upon exercise. Unless and until the Company is able to amend its certificate of incorporation to increase its authorized common shares by at least an additional 500 million shares, there are insufficient shares authorized for exercise of the Series D warrants. An increase in authorized common shares requires approval of the Company\u2019s shareholders, and there is no assurance that its shareholders will approve this increase in authorized shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may reduce the likelihood of a potential change of control, or make it more difficult for its stockholders to replace management.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for its stockholders to replace management at a time when a substantial number of stockholders might favor a change in management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding for a staggered board; and\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships or increase the size of its board of directors.\nFurthermore, Delcath\u2019s board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the rights and preferences of the shares of any such series without stockholder approval. Any series of preferred stock is likely to be senior to the common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The board\u2019s ability to issue preferred stock may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus adversely affecting the market price of Delcath\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company is subject to the risks relating to penny stocks.\nTrading in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally institutions. These additional requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. A penny stock is defined generally as any non-exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Company has never declared or paid any dividends to the holders of its common stock and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company currently intends to retain all earnings for use in connection with the expansion of its business and for general corporate purposes. The board of directors will have the sole discretion in determining whether to declare and pay dividends in the future. The declaration of dividends will depend on profitability, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Company\u2019s board of directors. Delcath\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends in the future could be limited or prohibited by the terms of financing agreements that it may enter into or by the terms of any preferred stock that may be authorized and issued. The Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, holders of Delcath\u2019s common stock must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nIf the Company engages in acquisitions, reorganizations or business combinations, it will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect its business operations or its stockholders.\nThe Company may consider strategic alternatives, such as acquiring businesses, technologies or products or entering into a business combination with another company. If Delcath does pursue such a strategy, the Company could, among other things:\n\u2022\nissue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt that may place strains on its operations;\n\u2022\nspend substantial operational, financial and management resources in integrating new businesses, personnel intellectual property, technologies and products;\n\u2022\nassume substantial actual or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nreprioritize its programs and even cease development and commercialization of CHEMOSAT/Melphalan/HDS;\n\u2022\nsuffer the loss of key personnel, or\n\u2022\nmerge with, or otherwise enter into a business combination with, another company in which Delcath stockholders would receive cash or shares of the other company or a combination of both on terms that certain of the Company\u2019s stockholders may not deem desirable.\nAlthough we intend to evaluate and consider different strategic alternatives, we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisition, reorganization or business combination at this time.", "PERMNO": 89169, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "DCTH"}
