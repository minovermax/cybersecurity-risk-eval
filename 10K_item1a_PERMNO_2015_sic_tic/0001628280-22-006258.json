RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the Business\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider each of the risks and uncertainties described in this section and all of the other information in this document before deciding to invest in our common stock. Any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The market price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks or uncertainties develops into actual events, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nCOVID-19 has had and may continue to have a material, adverse impact on us.\nA novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, has spread globally, including to the United States, Germany, and Poland where we have significant operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to directly and indirectly materially and adversely affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The extent to which these adverse impacts will continue will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted with precision or certainty at this time.\nAcross our operations, although most governmental restrictions on certain medical procedures have been lifted, the pandemic has adversely impacted our business activities, as healthcare resources are still being prioritized for the treatment and management of the outbreak in some cases. Consequently, there are delays in delivering certain elective and non-emergent procedures and significant volatility or reductions in demand for such procedures may continue. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that hospitals and other healthcare providers may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease or due to shutdowns that have been and may continue to be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Further, disruptions in the manufacture or distribution of our products or in our supply chain may occur as a result of the pandemic or pandemic-related events that result in staffing shortages, production slowdowns, stoppages, or disruptions in delivery systems, any of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or distribute our products, or to obtain the raw materials and supplies necessary to manufacture and/or distribute our products, in a timely manner, or at all.\nCOVID-19 has had an adverse effect on the overall productivity of our workforce, and we may be required to continue to take extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of our employees and those of our business partners. In\naddition, our employees may be required to take time off for extended periods of time due to illness, or as a result of government-imposed changes to daily routines. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue.\nAs the global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, it could continue to both materially and adversely affect our revenues, cash flows, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for an indeterminate period of time. Notwithstanding recent developments with respect to vaccines for COVID-19, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing pandemic will have due to numerous factors that are not within our control, including its duration and severity. Stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, business closures, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions, employee illness or quarantines, and other extended periods of interruption to our business have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions to our operations. These interruptions have had and could continue to have adverse impacts on the growth of our business, have caused and could continue to cause us to cease or delay operations, and could prevent our customers from receiving shipments or processing payments. Any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and available capital sources to finance capital expenditures and other working capital needs and to finance contingent consideration and forward contract arrangements when they become due.\nOur business operations generally require significant upfront capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2021, we had capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $51.3 million. We will continue to expend substantial cash resources for the foreseeable future, for, among other things, the development of our digital health solutions platform, including applications based on the HOLOTM AI technology, inventory, the investments in our product pipeline, and other operating expenses. These expenditures will include costs associated with marketing and selling our products, obtaining certain regulatory approvals, and expanding our technology pipeline. In connection with prior acquisitions, we are required to make contingent consideration earnout payments to the sellers if certain metrics relating to the acquired businesses have been achieved. As of December 31, 2021, we had accrued $51.9 million in contingent consideration as liabilities that we owe in connection with our prior acquisitions. In addition we have $10.0 million related to forward contracts that we may owe if certain milestones are met based on the INN acquisition. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient cash on hand or available capital to finance our capital expenditures and other working capital needs or fund contingent consideration payments when they become due, and failure to do so may result in a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nWe have a history of net losses, we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a history of net losses from our continuing operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses from continuing operations of $122.9 million, $194.2 million, and $248.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $569.6 million. We have incurred significant net losses and have relied on our ability to fund our operations through revenues from the sale of our products and through various forms of financings. A successful transition to sustained profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. This may not occur and, unless and until it does, we will continue to need to raise additional capital. We may seek additional funds from public and private equity or debt financings, borrowings under debt facilities or other sources to fund our projected operating requirements. However, we may not be able to obtain further financing on reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds on a timely basis, or at all, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Acceptance of our products by spine surgeons, patients, hospitals and third-party payers;\n\u2022Demand and pricing of our products;\n\u2022The mix of our products sold, because profit margins differ among our products;\n\u2022Timing of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022Our ability to grow and maintain a productive sales and marketing organization and distributor network;\n\u2022Regulatory approvals and legislative changes affected the products we may offer or those of our competitors;\n\u2022The effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022Levels of third-party reimbursement for our products;\n\u2022Interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\n\u2022Our ability to produce or obtain products of satisfactory quality or in sufficient quantities to meet demand; and\n\u2022Changes in our ability to obtain FDA, state and international approval or clearance for our products.\nThe effect of one of the factors discussed above, or the cumulative effects of a combination of factors, could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nOur auditors have issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d audit opinion.\nOur current and former independent auditors have indicated in their report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders, in the event of liquidation.\nFurther, we are projecting that we will continue to generate significant negative operating cash flows over the next 12 months and beyond. In consideration of these projected negative cash flows, as well as, (i) contingent consideration amounts payable in cash in connection with the Holo Surgical and INN acquisitions; (ii) additional payment obligations we may owe to our suppliers in respect of minimum purchase requirements under our supply contracts; (iii) uncertainties related to potential settlements from ongoing litigation and regulatory investigations; (iv) the unsecured promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $10.6 million issued to the sellers in connection with the INN acquisition; and (v) uncertainties related to COVID-19, we have forecasted the need to raise additional capital in order to continue as a going concern. Our operating plan for the next 12-month period also includes continued investments in our product pipeline that will necessitate additional debt and/or equity financing in addition to the funding of future operations through 2022 and beyond. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Further, if there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and no assurance can be given that future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements through 2022, we may be required to scale back operations, reduce research and development expenses, and postpone, as well as suspend, capital expenditures, in order to preserve liquidity, or be forced to liquidate the Company, in which case it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment.\nWe are involved in an ongoing government investigation by the SEC, the results of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting advisors, conducted an internal investigation of matters relating to our revenue recognition practices for certain contractual arrangements, primarily with OEM customers, including the accounting treatment, financial reporting and\ninternal controls related to such arrangements (the \u201cInvestigation\u201d). The Investigation also examined transactions to understand the practices related to manual journal entries for accrual and reserve accounts. The Investigation was precipitated by an investigation that the SEC is currently conducting of prior period matters relating to our revenue recognition practices (the \u201cSEC Investigation\u201d). We are currently in discussions with the SEC regarding a potential settlement of the SEC Investigation. It is uncertain at this time whether any settlement will be reached or the terms of any such settlement, which could include the payment of significant monetary amounts. If we are unable to reach a settlement with the SEC, or if the terms of such settlement involve significant monetary payments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, along with our reputation with customers and business partners, could be significantly adversely affected.\nIn the future, we may become subject to additional litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations that could result in additional unanticipated legal costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation. If we are not successful in any such litigation, we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. While we maintain insurance coverages that are intended to address certain aspects of such proceedings and any litigation that may arise, such insurance may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNumerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators, and third-party payers to curb rising healthcare costs, in addition to other economic factors, have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create new companies with greater market power, including hospitals. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become, and will likely continue to become, more intense. This in turn has resulted, and will likely continue to result in, greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from various market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our existing and prospective customers. We expect the market demand, government regulation, and third-party reimbursement policies, among other potential factors, will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and prospective customers, which may reduce competition among our existing and prospective customers, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our implants and may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site and off-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, viruses, breaches, or interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance, terrorist attacks, hurricanes, fire, flood, other natural disasters, power loss, computer systems failure, data network failure, internet failure, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates, but these measures may not adequately protect us from any risks. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also interrupt our operations, including our ability to receive and ship orders from customers, bill our customers, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to maintain existing strategic relationships or are unable to identify distributors of our implants, our revenues may decrease.\nWe currently derive a significant amount of our revenues through distributors. Variations in the timing and volume of orders by our distributors, particularly those who distribute a significant amount of our implants, may have a material effect upon our revenues. Further, if our relationships with our distributors are terminated or impaired for any reason and we are unable to replace these relationships with other means of distribution, we could suffer a material decrease in revenues.\nWe may need, or decide it is otherwise advantageous to us, to obtain the assistance of additional distributors to market and distribute our new implants and technologies, as well as to market and distribute our existing implants and technologies, to existing or new markets or geographical areas. We may not be able to find additional distributors who will agree to and are able to successfully market and distribute our implants and technologies on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to establish additional distribution relationships on favorable terms, our revenues may decline. In addition, our distributors may choose to favor the products of our competitors over ours and give preference to them.\nAlso, our financial results are dependent upon the service efforts of our distributors. If our distributors are unsuccessful in adequately servicing our products, our sales could significantly decrease and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely impacted.\nSupply chain disruptions could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nGlobal supply chains have been disrupted, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Accordingly, the availability of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products may be adversely impacted. Additionally, even when we and our suppliers are able to source such materials and components, they may cost more and may only be available on a delayed basis. Higher materials and component costs could adversely affect our margins if we are unable to pass such costs along to customers in the form of price increases. Delays in receipt of materials and components could also interrupt our production and cause us to go into back order on certain of our products, further exacerbating the effect of the global supply chain disruption.\nIf we, our suppliers, or parties who manufacture our products fail to maintain the high quality standards that implants require, if we are unable to procure processing capacity as required, or if the parties who manufacture our products experience disruptions in their ability to procure materials to manufacture our products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nImplants require careful calibration and precise, high-quality processing and manufacturing, and we rely on a small number of suppliers for the manufacturing of our implants. Achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our suppliers. If we or our suppliers fail to achieve and maintain these high standards, or fail to avoid processing and manufacturing errors, we could be forced to recall, withdraw, or suspend distribution of our implants; our implants and technologies could fail quality assurance and performance tests; production and deliveries of our implants could be delayed or cancelled, and our processing and manufacturing costs could increase. For example, our former OEM Businesses notified us that they are issuing a voluntary recall of their Cervalign\u00ae ACP System, for which we are a distributor, and is in the process of conducting an internal quality review of the system\u2019s locking mechanism. In connection with the voluntary recall, we are asking our customers and distributors to return any inventory of the Cervalign\u00ae ACP System they have in their possession. We incurred a charge of approximately $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of our write-off of Cervalign\u00ae ACP System inventory. The design has been modified, manufacturing has produced quality replacements, and commercialization resumed in a controlled manner in September 2021.\nAlthough we are not aware of any injuries caused by the defect in this product, there can be no assurance that we will not receive claims with respect to any such injuries in the future for which we may have liability and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In general, the reporting of product defects or voluntary recalls to the FDA or analogous regulatory bodies outside the United States, including the Cervalign\u00ae ACP System recall, which was reported to the FDA on January 22, 2021, could result in manufacturing audits, inspections and broader recalls or other disruptions to our and/or our suppliers\u2019 businesses. This and future recalls, whether voluntary or required, could result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.\nIn addition, since we rely on a small number of parties to manufacture our products, any interruption or cancellation in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material for such parties could materially harm their ability to\nmanufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, a change in parties who manufacture our products will require qualification of the new party to ensure they comply with our quality standards. Delays in qualifying a new party could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur success depends on the continued acceptance of our surgical implants and technologies by the medical community, and rapid technological changes could result in reduced demand for our implants and products.\nNew implants, technologies or enhancements to our existing implants may never achieve broad market acceptance, which can be affected by numerous factors, including lack of clinical acceptance of implants and technologies; introduction of competitive treatment options that render implants and technologies too expensive or obsolete; lack of availability of third-party reimbursement; and difficulty training surgeons in the use of implants and technologies.\nMarket acceptance will also depend on our ability to demonstrate that our existing and new implants and technologies are an attractive alternative to existing treatment options. Our ability to do so will depend on surgeons\u2019 evaluations of the clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability and cost-effectiveness of these treatment options and technologies.\nIf we are unable to achieve the improvements in our implants necessary for their successful commercialization, the demand for our implants will suffer.\nWe face intense competition, which could result in reduced acceptance and demand for our implants and technologies.\nThe medical technology industry is intensely competitive. We compete with companies in the United States and internationally that engage in the development and production of medical technologies and processes including biotechnology, orthopedic, pharmaceutical, biomaterial and other companies; academic and scientific institutions; and public and private research organizations.\nMany of our competitors have much greater financial, technical, research, marketing, distribution, service, and other resources than we do. Moreover, our competitors may offer a broader array of medical devices, surgical instruments and technologies and have greater name recognition in the marketplace. Our competitors also include several development-stage companies, that may develop or market technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our technologies, or that may render our technologies obsolete.\nWe or our competitors may be exposed to product or professional liability claims which could cause us to be liable for damages or cause investors to think we will be liable for similar claims in the future.\nOur business of designing and marketing medical devices and surgical instruments exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in such activities. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.\nOur product and professional liability insurance may not be adequate for potential claims if we are not successful in our defenses. Moreover, insurance covering our business may not always be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If our insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may not have sufficient funds to do so, which would harm our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, successful product liability claims made against one of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us or expose us to a perception that we are vulnerable to similar claims. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, may also hurt our ability to obtain surgeon acceptance of our implants or to expand our business.\nA disruption in our relationship with our former OEM Businesses could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur former OEM Businesses will continue to manufacture certain metal, synthetic and tissue-based implants and associated instrumentation and process certain sterilized allograft implants for us pursuant to distribution agreements with Ardi Bidco Ltd. and certain of its affiliates. During portions of the term of such distribution agreements, the OEM Businesses will also provide certain supply chain services (including warehousing and drop-shipment services) and design and development services to us. The distribution agreements have an initial term of five years with a possibility of renewal. Our former OEM Businesses in the past have experienced and continue to experience delays, as a result of employee\nturnover or otherwise, which have and may in the future cause us to experience delays in receiving supplies under the distribution agreements. Any disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with the OEM Businesses could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs.\nIf we are not successful in expanding our distribution activities into international markets, we will not be able to pursue one of our strategies for increasing revenues.\nOur international distribution strategies vary by market, as well as within each country in which we operate. Our international operations will be subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks we face in the United States, including the need to obtain regulatory approvals in additional foreign countries before we can offer our implants and technologies for use; the potential burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; longer distribution-to-collection cycles, as well as difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; dependence on local distributors; limited protection of intellectual property rights; fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies; and political and economic instability.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe were recently involved in stockholder class action and derivative litigation, as well as intellectual property litigation, and may in the future become involved in other class actions, derivative actions, private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, competitors, government agencies, or others. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Although some of the costs and expenses of such claims may be covered by insurance, any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time, and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are dependent on our key management and technical personnel for continued success.\nOur senior management team is concentrated in a small number of key members, and our future success depends to a meaningful extent on the services of our executive officers and other key team members, including members of our scientific staff. Generally, our executive officers and employees can terminate their employment relationship at any time. The loss of any directors or key employees or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCompetition for qualified leadership and scientific personnel in our industry is intense, and we compete for leadership and scientific personnel with other companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified leadership and scientific personnel, and there can be no assurance that we are able to do so. Any difficulty in hiring or retaining needed personnel, or increased costs related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are dependent on the services of our Chief Medical Officer, Kris Siemionow, for the Company\u2019s growth strategy in digital health to further the Company\u2019s growth strategy in digital surgery. The Company acquired Holo Surgical and equity interests in INN from entities directly or indirectly owned by Mr. Siemionow and/or Paul Lewicki, a director of the Company, pursuant to which we made covenants to Mr. Siemionow and Mr. Lewicki. For example, (i) we may be required to pay contingent consideration to Mr. Siemionow and Mr. Lewicki as a result of achievement of certain milestones under the Holo Surgical purchase agreement; (ii) we may be required to pay consideration to entities wholly owned by Mr. Siemionow and Mr. Lewicki in satisfaction of the contingent obligation to purchase additional equity interests in INN as a result of achievement of certain milestones under the INN purchase agreement; (iii) we are required to maintain a research and development team in Poland until October 23, 2023 subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in the Holo Surgical purchase agreement; and (iv) we cannot materially decrease the number of employees and independent\ncontractors providing services to INN and cannot otherwise materially reduce support for INN\u2019s product development, approval, marketing and sales, as further described in the INN purchase agreement.\nAny acquisitions, strategic investments, divestures, mergers, or joint ventures we make may require the issuance of a significant amount of equity or debt securities and may not be scientifically or commercially successful.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions to obtain additional businesses, product and/or process technologies, capabilities, and personnel. If we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes securities, we may be required to issue a substantial amount of equity, debt, warrants, convertible instruments, or other similar securities. Such an issuance could dilute your investment in our Common Stock or increase our interest expense and other expenses. In addition, we may be required to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized capital stock in order to fully satisfy all such contingent consideration share payments, to the extent they become payable. Any such charter amendment would permit us to issue additional shares for future acquisitions or other purposes, which may lead to further dilution of your investment in our Common Stock.\nOur long-term strategy may include identifying and acquiring, investing in, or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms, divesting of certain business lines or activities, or entering into joint ventures. In particular, over time we may acquire, make investments in, or merge with providers of product offerings that complement our business or may terminate such activities. Mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures include a number of risks and present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Failure to derive the expected benefits of the acquisitions;\n\u2022Difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, technology and personnel of an acquired business;\n\u2022Our inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business;\n\u2022Our inability to maintain relationships with customers and key third parties, such as alliance partners;\n\u2022Exposure to legal claims for activities of an acquired business prior to the acquisition;\n\u2022The potential need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources;\n\u2022The potential for internal control deficiencies in the internal controls of acquired operations;\n\u2022Potential inexperience in a business area that is either new to us or more significant to us than prior to an acquisition;\n\u2022The diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022The potential impairment of goodwill and write-off of in-process research and development costs, adversely affecting our reported results of operations; and\n\u2022Increased costs to integrate or, in the case of a divestiture or joint venture, separate the technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired or divested business or assets.\nAny one of these risks could prevent an acquisition, strategic investment, divesture, merger or joint venture from being scientifically or commercially successful, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may fail to realize the potential benefits of our Holo Surgical Acquisition and our acquisition of equity interests in INN, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe completed our acquisition of Holo Surgical in October 2020. Holo Surgical is in the process of developing an AI-based digital surgery platform designed to enable digital spine surgery. Additionally, we recently completed an acquisition of 42% of the equity interests in INN in December 2021. INN is in the process of developing proprietary AI technology for autonomously segmenting and identifying neural structures in medical images. As a result, the Holo Surgical and INN acquisitions provide us with an entry into the digital surgical products market, a business line in which we have not previously engaged, which may be challenging to integrate with our core product lines and more difficult to develop and manage than we anticipated.\nWe cannot provide assurance that these acquisitions will result in long-term benefits to us or our stockholders, or that we will be able to effectively integrate and manage the Holo Surgical and INN businesses. Our ability to successfully integrate, and realize the potential benefits of, our acquisition of Holo Surgical and INN is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including:\n\u2022Holo Surgical and INN are pre-revenue, development stage companies with no commercial operations;\n\u2022Holo Surgical\u2019s and INN\u2019s potential future profitability is dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of their offerings, which may not occur in the timeframe we expect or at all;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals from the FDA, the European Commission or other foreign regulatory authorities for Holo Surgical\u2019s and INN\u2019s offerings for us to begin marketing or selling such offerings, or any material delays in receiving such regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Complying with regulatory requirements applicable to the Holo Surgical and INN businesses and their offerings that we were not previously subject to;\n\u2022Difficulties in educating the market on, and obtaining market acceptance of, the offerings of Holo and INN, which we believe involve new technology that has not been used previously by the market and must compete with more established treatments currently accepted as the standards of care;\n\u2022Potential future challenges to, or third-party claims in respect of, our intellectual property rights underlying Holo Surgical and INN;\n\u2022Difficulties assimilating and retaining key personnel of the Holo Surgical and INN businesses, including any personnel directly involved in the development of Holo Surgical and INN\u2019s offerings;\n\u2022Difficulties in combining or integrating Holo Surgical\u2019s or INN\u2019s business into the Company\u2019s existing business, with such integration becoming more costly or time consuming than we originally anticipated;\n\u2022Discovery of liabilities of Holo Surgical and INN that are broader in scope and magnitude or are more difficult to manage than originally anticipated or were not previously identified; and\n\u2022Inability or failure to successfully integrate financial reporting and information technology systems.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate, develop and manage Holo Surgical and INN and their operations, or if we experience delays or other challenges with executing our strategy for Holo Surgical and INN\u2019s offerings or combining the businesses, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be negatively impacted. In addition, the integration processes could result in higher-than-expected costs, diversion of management attention and disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe and certain of our suppliers may be subject to extensive government regulation that increases our costs and could limit our ability to market or sell our products.\nThe medical devices we market are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities regulate the development, approval, classification, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and sale of medical devices. Likewise, our use and disclosure of certain categories of health information may be subject to federal and state laws, implemented and enforced by governmental authorities that protect health information privacy and security. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation\u201d herein for a summary of certain regulations to which we are subject. Further, we cannot predict whether, in the future, the U.S. or foreign governments may impose new regulations that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe approval or clearance by governmental authorities, including the FDA in the United States, is generally required before any medical devices may be marketed in the United States or other countries. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and approvals to develop and market a medical device can be costly, time-consuming, and subject to the risk that such clearances or approvals will not be granted on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn addition, we may be subject to compliance actions, penalties, or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, or if the FDA challenges one or more of our determinations that a product modification did not require new approval or clearance by the FDA. Device manufacturers are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for \u201coff-label\u201d uses are false and fraudulent claims to the government. The failure to comply with \u201coff-label\u201d promotion restrictions can result in significant administrative obligations and costs, and potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\nWe and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and other international notified bodies to determine our compliance with FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations (21 CFR Part 820) (\u201cQSRs\u201d) and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or\nother regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our development of new laboratory tests or business strategy and on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMoreover, governmental authorities outside the United States have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or modifications to our products, our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer.\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of most new medical devices only after the devices have received clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201c510(k)\u201d) or are the subject of an approved premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d). The process of obtaining FDA clearance and approvals to develop and market a medical device can be costly, time-consuming, and subject to the risk that such clearances or approvals will not be granted on a timely basis, if at all.\nMost of our hardware and biologic products, as well as products under development by Holo and INN fall into an FDA classification that requires the submission of a 510(k) application. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. We must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims, and before we can market the new device, we must receive an order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the United States.\nThe 510(k) process generally takes three to nine months, but can take significantly longer, especially if the FDA requires a clinical trial to support the 510(k) application. Currently, we do not know whether the FDA will require clinical data in support of any 510(k) applications that we intend to submit for other products in our pipeline. In addition, the FDA continues to re-examine its 510(k) clearance process for medical devices and published several draft guidance documents that could change that process. Any changes that make the process more restrictive could increase the time it takes for us to obtain clearances or could make the 510(k) process unavailable for certain of our products.\nA PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process or is not exempt from premarket review by the FDA. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing and control data and proposed labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA process is more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process, and generally takes between one and three years, if not longer. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022Our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that our products are safe or effective for their intended uses;\n\u2022The disagreement of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022Serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials;\n\u2022The data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;\n\u2022Our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks; or the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals may:\n\u2022Delay or prevent commercialization of products we develop;\n\u2022Require us to perform costly tests or studies;\n\u2022Diminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise have obtained; and\n\u2022Reduce our ability to collect revenue.\nThe FDA may require clinical data in support of any future 510(k) applications or PMAs that we intend to submit for products in our pipeline. We have limited experience in performing clinical trials that might be required for a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. If any of our products require clinical trials, the commercialization of such products could be delayed which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe safety of our products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data and may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought.\nThe ability to obtain a 510(k) clearance is generally based on the FDA\u2019s agreement that a new product is substantially equivalent to certain already marketed products. Because most 510(k)-cleared products were not the subject of pre-market clinical trials, spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our 510(k)-cleared products, we may not have the comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. With the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, funds have been appropriated for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Healthcare Research and Quality to conduct comparative effectiveness research to determine the effectiveness of different drugs, medical devices, and procedures in treating certain conditions and diseases. Some of our products or procedures performed with our products could become the subject of such research. It is unknown what effect, if any, this research may have on our business. Further, future research or experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes or improves patient outcomes less than we initially expected. Such results would reduce demand for our products, and this could cause us to withdraw our products from the market. Moreover, if future research or experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to significant legal liability, significant negative publicity, damage to our reputation and a dramatic reduction in sales of our products, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nRegulatory authorities around the world have enacted laws and regulations or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals, concerning data protection. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) and elsewhere are often uncertain and subject to change. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, public censure, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRecent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) on May 25, 2018, applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU customers. The GDPR created a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance. In addition, the European Commission in July 2016 and the Swiss Government in January 2017 approved the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements to freely import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges, and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both the EU and the United States. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. This has resulted in some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf third-party payers fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for the use of our implants, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain. In 2010, federal legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system was enacted into law. The impact of this far-reaching legislation, including Medicare provisions purportedly aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is designed and delivered. It is possible that aspects of currently enacted legislation may change or be struck down by the courts. The extent of any such changes and the impact on our business is uncertain. We therefore cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation, court rulings or regulation in the United States. Amendments to, or rescissions of, existing laws and regulations, or the implementation of new ones, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is designed and delivered. Any change that lowers reimbursement for an implant, our services,\nor our other technologies, or that reduces medical procedure volumes, would likely adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, including fraud and abuse laws, as well as anti-bribery laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws.\nOur relationship with foreign and domestic government entities and healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals, and those to whom and through whom we may market our implants and technologies, are subject to scrutiny under various federal, state, and territorial laws in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include, for example, anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws, false claims laws, criminal health care fraud laws, and anti-bribery laws (e.g., the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010). Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, and their respective counterparts in the applicable foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years.\nWe may be subject to suit under a state or federal whistleblower statute.\nThose who engage in business with the federal government, directly or indirectly, may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These lawsuits, known as qui tam suits, are authorized under certain circumstances by the False Claims Act and can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any of these lawsuits were to be brought against us, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Affordable Care Act has sought to link the violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute with violations of the False Claims Act, making it arguably easier for the government or for whistleblowers, acting in the name of the government, to sue medical manufactures under the False Claims Act.\nIn addition to federal whistleblower laws, various states in which we operate also have separate whistleblower laws to which we may be subject.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf our patents and the other means we use to protect our intellectual property prove to be inadequate, our competitors and other parties could exploit our intellectual property or develop and commercialize products and technologies similar or identical to ours and our ability to successfully commercialize any products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property with respect to our products. The law of patents and trade secrets is constantly evolving and often involves complex legal and factual questions. The U.S. government or applicable bodies in other jurisdictions may deny or significantly reduce the coverage we seek for our patent applications before or after a patent is issued. We cannot be sure that any particular patent for which we apply will be issued, that the scope of the patent protection will be comprehensive enough to provide adequate protection from competing technologies, that interference, derivation, reexamination, post-grant review, inter parties review or other proceedings regarding any of our patent applications will not be filed, or that we will achieve any other competitive advantage from a patent. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our patents will be held invalid or reduced in scope of claims if challenged or that others will claim rights in or ownership of our patents and other proprietary rights. If any of these events occur, our competitors and other parties may be able to use our intellectual property to compete more effectively against us.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Because patent applications remain secret until published (typically 18 months after first filing) and the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that our patent application was the first application filed disclosing or potentially covering a particular invention. If another party\u2019s rights to an invention are superior to ours, we may not be able to obtain a license to use that party\u2019s\ninvention on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, our competitors, many of which have greater resources than us, could obtain patents that will prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make use of our inventions either in the United States or in international markets. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not always protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Litigation or regulatory proceedings in the United States or foreign countries also may be necessary to defend and enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of our competitors. These proceedings may prove unsuccessful and result in our patents being found invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and may also be costly, result in development delays, and divert the attention of our management. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely on unpatented proprietary techniques, processes, trade secrets and know-how, which can be difficult to protect. It is possible that others will independently develop technology similar to our technology or otherwise gain access to or disclose our proprietary technologies. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights in these proprietary technologies, which would reduce our ability to compete.\nWe seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, collaborators, service providers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, and if we are unable to do so we may be liable for damages.\nWe cannot be certain that U.S. or foreign patents or patent applications of other companies do not exist or will not be issued that would prevent us from commercializing our medical devices, surgical instruments, and other technologies. Third parties have sued us, and in the future may sue us, for infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their patent or other intellectual property rights, regardless of the merit of such claims. Intellectual property litigation is costly. Even if we believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability, or priority. If we do not prevail in litigation, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. We could also be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license requiring us to make royalty and other payments. It is possible that a required license may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, a required license may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing, royalty, and other payments. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around another company\u2019s patent, we may be unable to make use of some of the affected technologies or distribute the affected surgical implants, which would reduce our revenues.\nThe defense costs and settlements for patent infringement lawsuits are not covered by insurance. Patent infringement lawsuits can take years to settle. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our management and other personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. If we are not successful in our defenses or are not successful in obtaining dismissals of any such lawsuit, we could be required to pay substantial legal fees or settlement costs. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants, and advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe received a written notice from Nasdaq that we have failed to comply with certain listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, which could result in our Common Stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nOn December 23, 2021, we received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our Common Stock has been below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been given 180 calendar days, or until June 21, 2022, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before June 21, 2022, the bid price of our Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide written confirmation that the Company has achieved compliance. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by June 21, 2022, the Company may be afforded a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company would be required to transfer to The Nasdaq Capital Market and meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, except for the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In addition, the Company would be required to notify Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the end of the compliance period (or the second compliance period, if applicable), our Common Stock will become subject to delisting.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of our Common Stock and will likely be required to seek approval from our stockholders to affect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock. However, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split would be approved by our stockholders. Further, there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our Common Stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. Even if the reverse stock split is approved by our stockholders, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nIf we are delisted from Nasdaq, our Common Stock may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. If we are not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for our Common Stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares of Common Stock. Moreover, if we are delisted from Nasdaq, but obtain a substitute listing for our Common Stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of Common Stock on any such substitute market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of our Common Stock, Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants would likely be significantly adversely\naffected. A delisting of our Common Stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.\nIf we implement a reverse stock split, liquidity of our Common Stock, Warrants, Pre-Funded Warrants and\nUnderwriter Warrants may be adversely affected.\nWe will likely be required to seek approval from our stockholders to affect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock in order to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Minimum Bid Requirement. However, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split would be approved by our stockholders. Further, there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our Common Stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. The liquidity of the shares of our Common Stock, Warrants, Pre-Funded Warrants and Underwriter Warrants may be affected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of our Common Stock that will be outstanding following the reverse stock split, especially if the market price of our Common Stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split.\nFollowing any reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our Common Stock may not attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Although we believe that a higher market price of our Common Stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our Common Stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our Common Stock may not necessarily improve.\nOur stock price has been, and could continue to be, volatile.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which may be unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations could negatively affect the market price of our stock. The market price and volume of our common stock could fluctuate, and in the past has fluctuated, more than the stock market in general. During the 12 months ended January 31, 2022, the market price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $3.27 per share to a low of $0.62 per share. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock.\nThe future issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances or sales could occur, may negatively impact our stock price and you may experience significant dilution, as a result of future issuances of our securities.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely impact its price. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize us to issue 300,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, there were 146,640,069 shares of our common stock outstanding. Accordingly, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are outstanding and available for sale in the market. In addition, we may be obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options, in connection with employee benefit plans (including any equity incentive plans) and in connection with contingent payments under acquisition agreements to which we are a party.\nIn the future, we may decide to raise capital through offerings of our common stock, additional securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or rights to acquire these securities or our common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or additional securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock could result in dilution of existing stockholders\u2019 equity interests in us. Issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock, and we cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law, and the terms of certain milestone obligations to which we are subject, may inhibit potential acquisition bids for our company and prevent changes in our management, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in management that our stockholders might deem advantageous, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result of these provisions, the price investors may be willing to pay for shares of our common stock may be limited. Moreover, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our\ncurrent management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include the ability of our Board to issue and set the terms of preferred stock, an absence of cumulative voting rights, advance notice procedures and the ability of our Board to amend our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nFurther, pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2018, pursuant to which we acquired Paradigm, we will be obligated to pay some or all of the milestone payments thereunder that remain unpaid - whether or not we have achieved the milestones - upon a change in control of our company prior to December 31, 2022. In addition, under the Holo Surgical Purchase Agreement, any surviving entity or acquiror in a change of control transaction involving our company will be required to assume any outstanding milestone obligations thereunder. These milestone payments and obligations could likewise discourage or disincentivize a change of control of our company that our stockholders might deem advantageous.", "PERMNO": 88564, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "SRGA"}
