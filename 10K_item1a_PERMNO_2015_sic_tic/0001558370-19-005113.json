RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the GBG Business and realize the anticipated benefits of the GBG Acquisition.\nThe GBG Acquisition materially changed the nature of our business. While we intend to continue to engage in our historic branded operating business, as a result of the GBG Acquisition our primary business is now a brand licensee model. Although we expect to receive synergistic benefits from acting as both a brand operator/licensor and licensee, the anticipated benefits we expect from the GBG Acquisition are, necessarily, based on projections and assumptions about the combined businesses of the Company and the GBG Business, which may not materialize as expected or which may prove to be inaccurate. The value of our common stock as well as our ability to service our financing arrangements could be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the GBG Acquisition. Achieving the benefits of the GBG Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the GBG Business successfully and efficiently with our business. The challenges and risks involved in this integration, which will be complex and time-consuming, include the following:\n\u00b7\ninability to successfully managing relationships and retaining our key customers, suppliers, licensors, partners and employees;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to successfully integrate the GBG Business in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the GBG Acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe challenge of integrating human resources, logistics, information, communication and other systems in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, licensors, partners, employees and other constituencies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop internally or find third-party replacements for the services currently being provided by GBG USA to us under the Transition Services Agreement;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of the attention of our management and other key employees;\n\u00b7\nthe challenge of integrating our workforce and that of the GBG Business;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our existing business;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen expenses or delays associated with the GBG Acquisition, including transition costs to integrate the two businesses that may exceed the costs that we currently anticipate;\n\u00b7\nadapting to the increased scale of our operations resulting from the GBG Acquisition;\n\u00b7\nassumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; and\n\u00b7\nother unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.\nIf we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating the GBG Business, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits and our revenue, expenses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe failure to maintain our license agreements could cause us to lose significant revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on sales of licensed products for a substantial portion of our revenues. Under many of our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve specified minimum net sales, make specified royalty and advertising payments and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. These license agreements also may restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products, may restrict our ability to sell inventory through certain distribution channels, or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of these requirements or receive approval with respect to a restriction within the license, a licensor usually has the right to terminate our license. Even if a licensor does not terminate our license, the failure to achieve net sales sufficient to cover our required minimum royalty payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we comply with all the terms of a license agreement, we cannot be sure that we will be able to extend or renew an agreement when it expires even if we desire to do so. The failure to maintain or renew our license agreements could cause us to lose significant revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe licensee market is competitive, and there is no guarantee we can obtain future licenses at all or upon terms favorable to us.\nThe licensee market is competitive, and there is no guarantee licensors will grant us licenses or upon terms favorable to us. Failure to obtain future licenses could limit our growth strategy. Failure to obtain licenses on terms favorable to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Also, licensors could decide not to grant licenses and instead to produce their own products and compete directly with us. As a result, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAcquisitions of new licenses and brands may not be successful in achieving the intended benefits.\nOur plans for future growth include potentially acquiring new licenses and/or brands. Our ability to acquire such new licenses or brands in the future, subject to certain limited exceptions, will require consent of our lenders under our debt financings. Prior to completing any such acquisition, our management team identifies the potential business opportunity and potential effect on our financial statements but, due to legal and business limitations, we may not have access to all necessary information. The process to integrate new brands and licenses into our business may be complex, costly and time-consuming, and if the acquisition does not provide the anticipated sales, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success will be dependent on the strategies and reputation of our licensors.\nWe offer our products on a multiple brand, channel and price point basis. As a part of this strategy, we may license the names and brands of numerous recognized companies, designers and celebrities. In entering into these license agreements, our products may be targeted towards particular market segments based on consumer demographics, design, suggested pricing and channel of distribution. If any of our licensors decides to \u201creposition\u201d its products under the brands we license from them, introduce similar products under similar brand names or otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribution, target market or competitive set, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand\u2019s business, adversely affecting our sales and profitability. In addition, as licensed products may be personally associated with designers or celebrities, our sales of those products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individuals\u2019 images, reputations or popularity were to be negatively impacted.\nOur business depends on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brands, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise, which would harm our business and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base, and requires us to make substantial investments in areas such as visual merchandising, marketing and advertising, employee training\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand store operations. We anticipate that, as our business expands into new markets and new product classifications and further penetrates existing markets, and as the markets in which we operate become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Certain of our competitors in the apparel industry have faced adverse publicity surrounding the quality, attributes and performance of their products. Our brand may similarly be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by failing to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a leader in the contemporary apparel industry and to continue to provide high quality products. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nWe face risks associated with constantly changing fashion trends, including consumer response to and demand for our products. If we are unable to adapt to changing fashion trends as to our existing or new products, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe attempt to minimize our risk associated with delivering items through early order commitments by retailers. We generally place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season\u2019s orders and orders may be cancelled by retailers before shipment. In addition, we take a position on inventory for replenishment and other sales programs which do not have orders from our customers in advance. As such, we bear the inventory and business risk associated with these programs. Therefore, if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial performance and impact our ability to service our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.3 billion in outstanding indebtedness. Subject to certain restrictions contained in our financing arrangements, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The high level of indebtedness of the Company could have important consequences for the Company and significant effects on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. For example, the level of indebtedness of the Company and the terms of our financing arrangements:\n\u00b7\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other capital needs;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying principal and interest on our debt may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, we will be required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, acquisitions and general corporate requirements, particularly if (1) the ratings assigned to our debt securities by nationally recognized credit rating organizations are revised downward or (2) we seek capital during periods of turbulent or unsettled market conditions;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and general corporate requirements;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nwith respect to any borrowings we make at variable interest rates, including under our senior secured credit facilities, leave us vulnerable to increases in interest rates to the extent the borrowings are not subject to an interest rate swap agreement;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or general corporate purposes, increases the risk that we will need to sell securities or assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, or take other unfavorable actions to meet payment obligations; and/or\n\u00b7\nincrease the risk that we will not meet the financial covenants contained in our current or future debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that will be beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The instruments governing our indebtedness will restrict our ability to sell assets and our use of the proceeds from such sales.\nAdditionally, if the PNC Receivables Facility (as defined below) is terminated without a replacement on substantially similar terms, we may experience material and adverse economic losses due to the loss of such factoring arrangement and the impact of such loss on our liquidity, which could have a material and adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under such agreements, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe Credit Agreements (as defined below) restrict our ability to, among other things: incur indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve; sell, lease or otherwise transfer any assets; substantially change the nature of the business; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends; enter into transactions with affiliates; amend material documents; and prepay indebtedness. Such agreements also require us to comply with various financial maintenance covenants. In addition, substantially all of our assets, including our trademarks, secure our obligations under such agreements. Any future debt agreements we enter into may contain similar or more restrictive covenants on our operational flexibility. For more information, see \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Agreements and Other Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nAny failure by us to comply with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements could have material adverse consequences. Such noncompliance may result in our inability to borrow under such agreements, which we utilize to access our working capital, and as a result may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or pursue any expansion plans. An event of default under such agreements could also result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. If the financing under our material indebtedness becomes due and payable, we may be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such obligations, sell assets, or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such refinancing in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all, or that such restructuring activities, sales of assets, or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations. Additionally, upon the occurrence of an \u201cevent of default\u201d under such agreements, all of our assets could be subject to liquidation by the creditors, which liquidation could result in no assets being left for our stockholders until the creditors receive their required payment.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreements bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to a London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or base rate plus the applicable stated interest rate. Borrowings under the PNC Receivables Facility and CIT Factoring Agreement (each as defined below) also bear interest at a variable interest rate. We have exposure for the variable interest rate indebtedness under these debt instruments and, as a result, an increase in interest rates could result in a substantial increase in interest expense.\nUncertainty regarding the LIBOR may adversely impact our indebtedness under our credit and loan facilities\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Proposed alternative reference interest rates so far are based on overnight tenors only, while the most frequently used LIBOR rates are for one, three and six month tenors. Borrowings under our Credit Agreements and the PNC Receivables Facility are linked to LIBOR. When LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend such financing arrangements based on a new standard that is established, if any. The basis of calculation of such standard is not yet agreed upon among market participants and as a result the cost of our borrowings may increase. In addition, any resulting differences in interest rate standards among our assets and our financing arrangements may result in interest rate mismatches between our assets and the borrowings used to fund such assets. There is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference interest rate will not result in financial market disruptions or significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs.\nWe face intense competition in the lifestyle apparel and accessories industries. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nWe face a variety of competitive challenges from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel producers, some of whom may be significantly larger and more diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. We do not currently hold a dominant competitive position in any market. We compete primarily on the basis of:\n\u00b7\nanticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner,\n\u00b7\nmaintaining favorable brand recognition,\n\u00b7\ndeveloping innovative, high-quality products in styles that appeal to consumers,\n\u00b7\nappropriately pricing products,\n\u00b7\nproviding strong and effective marketing support,\n\u00b7\ncreating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers,\n\u00b7\nensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers, and\n\u00b7\nobtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the value and images of our licensed or owned brands may be impaired.\nIf we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the value and images of our licensed or owned brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands\u2019 images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding us, our brands or our products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Our businesses may be similarly affected in the future.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demand and fashion trends in a timely manner, both as to existing products and as to other product classifications we may initiate. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect the acceptance of our existing or new products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities in the marketplace. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability. At the same time, a focus on tight management of inventory may result, from time to time, in our not having an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand and may cause us to lose sales.\nIf our customers change their buying patterns, request additional allowances, develop their own private label brands or enter into agreements with national brand manufacturers to sell their products on an exclusive basis, our sales to these customers could be materially adversely affected.\nOur customers\u2019 buying patterns, as well as the need to provide additional allowances to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Customers\u2019 strategic initiatives, including developing their own private label brands, selling national brands on an exclusive basis or reducing the number of vendors they purchase from, could also impact our sales to these customers.\nA decision by any of our major customers to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ten largest customers and customer groups. The ten largest customers accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales in Fiscal 2018, and those ten largest customers may comprise a significant part of our net sales on an ongoing basis. Also, during Fiscal 2018, our largest customer represented over 10 percent of our net sales. Consolidation in the retail industry could increase the concentration of sales to our largest customers. We generally do not have long-term agreements with any customers, and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis that may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. A decision by any of our major customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing or other partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our profitability. During the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes, as well as management changes and store closing programs, and we expect such changes to be ongoing. In addition, store closings by our customers, such as those described above, decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores\u2019 target markets or marketing strategies. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our customers. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are dependent on third parties to source and manufacture products and any disruption in relationships with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our business.\nOur business relies upon independent third parties for the manufacturing of its apparel and accessories products. Currently, we utilize Li & Fung as a sourcing agent to source a portion of our products pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. We expect to enter into a formal sourcing agreement with Li & Fung to source our products during 2019. The failure of our suppliers to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those products. As a result, customers could cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.\nAny of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u00b7\npolitical or labor instability or military conflict involving any of the countries in which we, our contractors, or our suppliers operate, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials to us and an increase in transportation costs;\n\u00b7\nheightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundments of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;\n\u00b7\na significant decrease in availability or increase in cost of raw materials or the inability to use raw materials produced in a country that is a major provider due to political, human rights, labor, environmental, animal cruelty or other concerns;\n\u00b7\na significant decrease in factory and shipping capacity or increase in demand for such capacity;\n\u00b7\na significant increase in wage and shipping costs;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, which could result in closed factories and scarcity of raw materials;\n\u00b7\ndisease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u00b7\nmigration and development of manufacturers, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;\n\u00b7\nimposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed;\n\u00b7\nimposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located.\nAdditionally, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot provide assurance that this additional\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncapacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or similar to any existing terms which we have with our manufacturers, either from a production standpoint or a financial standpoint.\nIf an independent manufacturer of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices, our business could suffer.\nWhile we require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we have no control over the ultimate actions of our independent manufacturers. We have internal and vendor operating guidelines to promote ethical business practices and our staff, as well as third parties we may contract with, periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers. We also use the services of third parties to conduct on site audits where required by labor laws to help minimize our risk and exposure to unacceptable labor practice violations. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.\nThe principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, blends, synthetics wools, and leather. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for the raw materials-primarily cotton, synthetics and leather-used to produce them. The price and availability of our raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, work stoppages, government regulation, economic climates and other unpredictable factors. Increases in raw material costs, together with other factors, could result in a decrease of our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. Moreover, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production requirements in a timely manner, which could adversely affects our revenues and working capital requirements.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with our vendors.\nWe purchase our raw materials through various suppliers. While we are not reliant exclusively on one or more particular vendor for the supply of the raw materials or component parts required to meet our manufacturing needs, we depend on our relationships and these vendors to ensure our supply of these raw materials or component parts. Any problems or disputes with these vendors could result in us having to source these raw materials or component parts from another vendor, which could delay production, and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to procure similar services being contracted for under the Transition Services Agreement may adversely impact our ability to integrate the GBG Business and/or operate its business.\nGBG USA, through various of its affiliates and third parties, currently provides a number of critical services to us, such as information technology services, financial systems, shared real estate and logistics support though the Transition Services Agreement. There is no assurance, however, that upon termination or expiration of the Transition Services Agreement, these services will be sustained at the same levels as they were when we received such services from GBG USA\u2019s affiliates and other third parties or that we will obtain the same benefits, even if such services are then provided by such parties. We may not be able to replace services and arrangements in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including cost, as favorable as those we previously received. Certain of these agreements between us and GBG USA and/or its affiliates previously entered into were entered into in the context of a related party or parent/subsidiary relationship, and we may have to pay higher prices for similar services from other unaffiliated third parties in the future. Moreover, if we are required to establish our own information technology services, legal compliance, financial reporting, real estate and logistics support functions or integrate them with any such functions provided by us, we may not be able to establish or integrate such functions in a timely, efficient or cost-effective manner and, as a result, our business operations may be adversely impacted.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProblems with the third party distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.\nWe rely on distribution facilities operated by third parties. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale partners and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. These third parties will continue to provide distribution services until both parties elect to mutually terminate such services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into other contracts for alternate or replacement distribution centers on acceptable terms or at all. Such an event could disrupt our operations. In addition, because substantially all of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, or by floods, fires, earthquakes or other natural disasters near such facilities. We maintain business interruption insurance; however, this coverage may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions to our distribution system. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies could be harmed. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nPotential changes in international trade relations between the United States and countries in which our products are sourced, including the imposition of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and operating results.\nOur products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors, many of whom are located outside of the United States, such as China, Cambodia, Vietnam, India and Mexico. Due to these high levels of foreign sourcing, our import operations are subject to international trade regulations, including import charges, and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and other bilateral textile agreements among the United States and its trading partners, including China. Recently, members of the United States government and other international governments have indicated that they may advocate and/or enact key policy shifts in diplomatic and commercial relations among the United States and other countries where our manufacturing contractors are based. These include the renegotiation of proposed and existing trade agreements, the implementation of tariffs or other measures affecting United States trade relations.\nIt remains unclear what any government may do with respect to these trade agreements and other restrictive measures, and we cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by or on the United States or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future. The United States government recently imposed tariffs on certain imports, and it is unclear what effects such tariffs (including any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on United States exports) will have on retail markets. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements to which it is a party, or if tariffs or other import charges were raised on foreign-sourced goods that we sell, it could substantially affect our ability to source goods at commercially attractive prices, thus having a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Increased restrictions on fund transfers to or from foreign countries and quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the United States and foreign countries could also hurt the economic viability of our foreign sourcing or cause our foreign counterparties to terminate their relationships with us, thus increasing our cost of goods sold or exposing us to additional capital expenses if we must find replacement manufacturing contractors or repatriate certain production to the United States. Changes in regulatory or geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our business in the future or may require us to modify our current business practices.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space, which are generally long-term non-cancelable leases requiring us to make substantial lease payments. Any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business, profitability and results of operations.\nWe do not own any of our retail stores, but instead lease all of our retail stores under retail store leases and are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Our lease terms generally range from three to ten years with an option to renew. Most of our leases require a fixed annual rent and/or payment of additional \u201cpercentage\u201d rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Partner shop-in-shops leases are generally based on a contractually defined percent of net sales agreed to by the parties for each specific location. Most of the retail store leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases, which require\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nus to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. Additionally, certain of the leases may allow the lessor to terminate the lease or not renew if we do not achieve a specified sales threshold in a particular year. We cannot be certain that we will achieve any of these thresholds. Any loss of our store locations due to underperformance may harm our results of operations, stock price and reputation.\nIf an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close, our business, profitability and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on successfully placing our stores in suitable locations and any impairment of a store location, including any decrease in customer traffic, could cause our sales to be less than expected.\nOur approach to identifying locations for our retail stores typically favors street and mall locations near retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers\u2019 demographics and shopping preferences. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of foot traffic in these locations. Changes in areas around our existing retail locations that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than expected and the related leases are generally noncancelable. Store locations may become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume and customer traffic generally may be harmed by, among other things:\n\u00b7\neconomic downturns in a particular area;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from nearby retailers selling similar product;\n\u00b7\nchanging consumer demographics in a particular market;\n\u00b7\nchanging preferences of consumers in a particular market;\n\u00b7\nthe closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our store; and\n\u00b7\nstore impairments due to acts of God, natural disasters, climate change or terrorism.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nidentify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores will be successful;\n\u00b7\nobtain desired locations, including store size and adjacencies, in targeted malls or streets;\n\u00b7\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations;\n\u00b7\nachieve brand awareness, affinity and purchase intent in the new markets;\n\u00b7\nhire, train and retain store associates and field management;\n\u00b7\nassimilate new store associates and field management into our corporate culture;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nsource and supply sufficient inventory levels; and\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully integrate new retail stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.\nLack of availability, of desired store locations, delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital restraints, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations or a lack of customer acceptance of stores in new market areas may negatively impact our new store growth and the costs or the profitability associated with new stores. There can be no assurance that we will open new stores in Fiscal 2019 or thereafter. Any failure to successfully open and operate new stores may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to grow comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores, which could cause our sales to decline.\nWe may not be able to grow our comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores. If our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline, the price of our overall net sales could decline. In addition, the aggregate results of operations through our wholesale partners and at our retail locations have fluctuated in the past may continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, consumer spending patterns, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our product assortment, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods or our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nUncertain economic conditions in the United States and other parts of the world can affect consumer confidence and consumer spending patterns and our business could be negatively impacted by the financial health of our retail customers.\nThe economy in the United States and abroad continues to be in the midst of uncertainty. The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits. Negative impacts to our customers\u2019 buying patterns, as well as the need to provide additional allowances to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers, our largest direct customers. Purchases of apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, when consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items, and disposable income decline. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industry, including, among others: prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new retail stores, or maintain or improve our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales.\nIn addition, we sell our products primarily to retail and distribution companies in the United States, Canada and Europe based on pre-qualified payment terms. Financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables. We are dependent primarily on lines of credit that we establish from time to time with customers, and should a substantial number of customers become unable to pay to us their respective debts as they become due, we may be unable to collect some or all of the monies owed by those customers. In particular, because of the concentration of our customer and customer groups, our results of operations could be adversely affected if any one of these customers fails to satisfy its payment obligations to us when due.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn recent years, the retail industry has experienced consolidation, restructurings, reorganizations, bankruptcies, and other ownership changes that have resulted in one entity controlling several different stores or the elimination of stores. This consolidation can result in fewer customers for our products or the closing of some stores or the number of \u201cdoors\u201d which carry our products. As a result, the potential for consolidation or ownership changes, closing of retail outlets and fewer customers could negatively impact sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic conditions have also led to a highly promotional environment and strong discounting pressure from both our wholesale partners and retail customers, which could lead to a negative impact on our revenues and profitability. The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, civil unrest or other hostilities around the world could lead to further decreases in consumer spending.\nOur plans to improve and expand our product offerings may not be successful, and the implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nWe plan to grow our business by improving and expanding our product offerings. We will continue to evaluate our plan to develop and introduce new product categories and pursue additional licensing opportunities.\nThe expansion into new products and classifications may require the establishment of new sourcing relationships, increasing our sourcing risk. See \"-We are dependent on third parties to source and manufacture products and any disruption in relationships with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our business.\u201d As we expand our licensing activities, we increase risks associated with our ability to conduct quality checks on merchandise, which could affect product quality.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends. These plans could be abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our net sales and profitability.\nIf we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our business results and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have made and are making investments to support our near and longer-term growth. If our operations continue to grow over the longer term, of which there can be no assurance, we will be required to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes, and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarters personnel. As noted above, the integration of the GBG Business could strain our existing resources. As a result, we could experience operating difficulties, including obtaining sufficient raw materials at acceptable prices, securing manufacturing capacity to produce our products and experiencing delays in production and shipments. These difficulties would likely lead to a decrease in net revenue, income from operations and the price of our common stock, and such decreases could be significant.\nOur trademark rights and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected and some of our products are targets of counterfeiting.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We may, however, experience conflict with various third parties who acquire or claim ownership rights in certain trademarks as we expand our product offerings and expand the number of countries where we sell our products. We cannot ensure that any actions taken to establish and protect these trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. Also, we cannot assure that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntrademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nOur products are sometimes the target of counterfeiters. As a result, there are often products that are imitations or \u201cknock-offs\u201d of our products that can be found in the marketplace or consumers can find products that are confusingly similar to ours. We intend to continue to vigorously defend our trademarks and products bearing our trademarks, however, we cannot assure you that our efforts will be adequate to prosecute and block all sales of infringing products from the marketplace.\nAs a licensor for certain categories for our Owned Brands, we may not be successful and our licensees may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other requirements, which may have an adverse effect on our brand equity, reputation or business.\nWe are a licensor for certain product categories for our Owned Brands. Under these arrangements, we license to third parties certain manufacturing, marketing and distribution rights for certain product categories and in certain geographic areas. We believe this will broaden and enhance the products available under these brand names. From time to time, these licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions by licensees over whom we have limited control.\nAlthough we have taken and will continue to take steps to select potential licensing partners carefully and to monitor the activities of our licensees (through, among other things, approval rights over product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, marketing, distribution and advertising), such arrangements may not be successful. Our licensees may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products.\nThe inability of any of our licensees to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations and reputation in regions or product categories.\nAny potential future acquisitions, strategic investments or mergers may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business and may lead to substantial dilution or negative effects on the market price of our common stock.\nOur strategy includes identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms in order to grow or complement our business. Acquisitions would involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management attention from running our existing business;\n\u00b7\npossible material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nincreased expenses including legal, administrative and compensation expenses related to newly hired employees;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs to integrate the technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired company with us;\n\u00b7\npotential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process, including cyber security risks;\n\u00b7\npotential adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nacquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; and\n\u00b7\nany acquired business, technology, service or product may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the acquisition.\nFor any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment or merger may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. In addition, the success of our strategy to pursue potential future acquisitions will depend on our ability to achieve savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses or the realization of other efficiencies associated with such acquisitions. Failure to implement our strategic plan with success, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings in connection with any potential future acquisitions, could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nThe seasonal nature of our business makes management more difficult, severely reduces cash flow and liquidity during parts of the year and could force us to curtail our operations.\nOur business is seasonal with the greatest volume of shipments and sales typically occurring in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Accordingly, our cash flow is typically strongest in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Conversely, we build-up inventories during our first and second fiscal quarters and as such, our cash flow is generally weaker in the first and second fiscal quarters. Unfavorable economic conditions affecting retailers during the fall and holiday seasons in any year could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year. We are likely to experience periods of negative cash flow throughout each year, including, a drop-off in business commencing each December, which could force us to curtail operations if adequate liquidity is not available. We cannot be certain that the effects of such seasonality will diminish in the future.\nOur success is largely dependent on the continued service of our key personnel.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the continued service of our key personnel, including personnel acquired in the GBG Acquisition and Jason Rabin, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Rabin and any negative market or industry perception arising from the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on us and the market price of our common stock. Our other executive officers and key personnel have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals or the inability to attract key personnel could also adversely affect us. Furthermore, turnover at the senior management level may create instability within the Company and our employees may terminate their employment, which could further impede our ability to maintain day-to-day operations. Such instability could also impede our ability to fully implement our business plan, which would harm our business and prospects.\nComputer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. We may also incur an increase in costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nWe depend on technology systems such as ERP systems, EDI communication with our retail customers and other technology applications. We also depend on IT systems and networks for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including sales of our products via ecommerce channels, retail business credit and debit card transaction authorizations and processing at our retail stores. Information technology systems are integral to other aspects of our business, such as corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and retail stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our apparel products, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data and employee information, and our interaction with the public in the social media space. Given the nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware, software systems, customer marketing databases, and email servers.\nThe retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber attacks, and a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. However, we may not have the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nresources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Additionally, although many of our third-party service providers use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nLaws on privacy continue to evolve and further limits on how we collect or use customer information could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect and store customer information primarily for marketing purposes and to improve the services we provide. The use or retention of certain customer information is subject to applicable privacy laws. These laws and the judicial interpretation of such laws are evolving on a frequent basis. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to fines or penalties, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any limitations imposed on the use of such customer information by federal, state or local governments, could have an adverse effect on our future marketing activities. Governmental focus on data security and/or privacy may lead to additional legislation or regulations. As a result, we may have to modify our business with the goal of further improving data security, which would result in increased expenses and operating complexity. To the extent our or our business partners' security procedures and protection of customer information prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or other claims, which could expose us to liability and cause damage to our reputation, brand and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOwnership of our common stock is concentrated among affiliates of Tengram Capital Partners (the \u201cTengram Affiliates\u201d), GSO Capital Partners LP, Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Advisors L.L.C., and certain other large holders, which substantially reduces the ability of other stockholders to influence management, including through the election of directors, and may result in decisions that do not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.\nAs of May 15, 2019, based upon the Amendment No. 4 to Schedule 13D dated October 29, 2018, and based upon our records, the largest beneficial owners of our common stock, funds managed by GSO Capital Partners LP and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Advisors L.L.C. (together, the \"GSO/BTO Affiliates\") and the Tengram Affiliates, beneficially own in the aggregate a majority of our common stock and voting power. This includes, in addition to shares of common stock owned outright by various GSO/BTO Affiliates and Tengram Affiliates, shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant held by Tengram Partners Fund II, L.P. (\u201cTengram II\u201d) to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock for $3.00 received in connection with the acquisition of SWIMS (the \u201cSWIMS Warrant\u201d). Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \"Bylaws\") permit any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders at a meeting to be effected by written consent by a majority of our stockholders for certain matters.\nOur largest shareholders, and particularly the GSO/BTO Affiliates and the Tengram Affiliates, are thus in a position to exert significant control over us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plans, and to exert significant control over our management and affairs. The GSO/BTO Affiliates and the Tengram Affiliates each have the right to appoint two directors to our board of directors. This concentration of beneficial ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to other stockholders. Additionally, the GSO/BTO Affiliates hold our 2024 Convertible Notes (as defined below) and are lenders under our Second Lien Credit Facility (as defined below), and their interests as a lender may differ from your interests as\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\na shareholder. For more information, see \u201cPart III, Item 12. Security \u201cOwnership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.\u201d\nOur common stock price is volatile and may decrease.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate and investors in our common stock could lose the value of their investment. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times, which could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe trading price and volume of our common stock has historically been subject to fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u00b7\nannual and quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u00b7\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of other apparel companies;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new product lines by us or our competitors, announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or dispositions of assets, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulation applicable to us and our products; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral conditions in the apparel industry.\nIn the 52 week period prior to the filing of this Annual Report, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from $0.83 to $6.89. In addition, stock markets generally have experienced price and volume trading volatility in recent years. This volatility has had an effect on the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we do not meet the expectations of equity research analysts, if they do not continue to publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our results of operations or financial condition are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our share price could decline. Moreover, the price of our common stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or do not publish research or reports about us or our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by future sales of our common stock.\nSales by us or holders of a substantial percentage of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities. If we or our existing stockholders, particularly our largest stockholders, our directors, their affiliates, or our executive officers, sell a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that we or these stockholders might sell our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our future ability to obtain capital, especially through an offering of equity securities. Certain of our large stockholders, including the GSO/BTO Affiliates and the Tengram Affiliates, have demand rights to require us to register their common stock for public sale. For more information on these agreements, see \u201cPart III, Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.\u201d\nIf our common stock\u2019s closing bid price falls and subsequently remains below the minimum price of $1.00 per share, our common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ.\nAs recently as June 26, 2018, immediately prior to the announcement of the GBG Acquisition, the closing price of our common stock fell below $1.00 per share. If our common stock were to trade below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing bid price required for continued listing on NASDAQ, for 30 consecutive business days, we will receive a notification letter from NASDAQ and will have 180 calendar days (subject to extension in some circumstances) to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the NASDAQ may require in some circumstances). If we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule or fail to maintain compliance with all other applicable NASDAQ continued listing requirements, NASDAQ may determine to delist our common stock, at which time our common stock would be quoted on the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. The delisting of our common stock could adversely impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, limiting our ability to issue additional securities in the future, and limiting our ability to fund our operations.\nDue to the delayed filing with the SEC of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Form 8-K/A due January 11, 2019, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nAs a result of the delayed filing with the SEC of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Form 8-K/A due January 11, 2019, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for one year, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to file all such reports in a timely manner in the future. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of additional securities to the public, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our business, strategic plan and financial condition. Furthermore, if we were to experience delays in making our future periodic filings with the SEC, it could subject us to delisting of our common stock from trading on the NASDAQ. The delisting of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of and hinder our stockholders\u2019 ability to trade in our common stock, and could also affect our ability to access the capital markets or complete acquisitions. If our shares of common stock were delisted, there could be no assurance of it again being listed for trading on NASDAQ or any other exchange.", "PERMNO": 76858, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "CTRCQ"}
