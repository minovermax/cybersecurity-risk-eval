Risk Factors\nWe cannot assure investors that our assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct. Important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements. Such factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors discussed below. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations would likely suffer.\nRisks Related to our Business, Operations and Industry\nWe have experienced variability in sales and may not be able to maintain profitable operations.\nSeveral factors have caused our results of operations to fluctuate and we expect some of these fluctuations to continue. Causes of these fluctuations include:\n\u25cf shifts in customer demand that affect our distribution models, including demand for total solutions;\n\u25cf loss of customers to competitors;\n\u25cf industry shipments of new products or upgrades;\n\u25cf changes in overall demand and timing of product shipments related to economic markets and to government spending;\n\u25cf changes in vendor distribution of products;\n\u25cf changes in our product offerings and in merchandise returns;\n\u25cf changes in distribution models as a result of cloud and software-as-a-service, or SaaS;\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution, or shipping; and\n\u25cf supply constraints.\nOur results also may vary based on our ability to manage personnel levels in response to fluctuations in revenue. We base personnel levels and other operating expenditures on sales forecasts. If our revenues do not meet anticipated levels in the future, we may not be able to reduce our staffing levels and operating expenses in a timely manner to avoid significant losses from operations.\nSubstantial competition could reduce our market share and may negatively affect our business.\nThe direct marketing industry and the computer products retail business, in particular, are highly competitive. We compete with other national solutions providers of hardware and software and computer related products, including CDW Corporation and Insight Enterprises, Inc., who are the current leaders in the space. Certain hardware and software vendors, such as Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and HP, who provide products to us, also sell their products directly to end users through their own direct salesforce, catalogs, stores, and via the Internet. We also compete with computer retail stores and websites, who are increasingly selling to business customers and may become a significant competitor, including e-tailers, such as Amazon Web Services, with more extensive commercial online networks. We compete not only for customers, but also for advertising support from IT product manufacturers. Some of our competitors have larger customer bases and greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and customer requirements. Many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition, engage in more extensive promotional activities, and adopt pricing policies that are more aggressive than ours. We expect competition to increase as retailers and solution providers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry.\nIn addition, product resellers and national solutions providers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and national solutions providers to increase efficiency. Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against our current or future competitors. If we encounter new competition or fail to compete effectively against our competitors, our business may be harmed.\nWe face and will continue to face significant price competition, which could result in a reduction of our profit margins.\nGenerally, pricing is very aggressive in our industry, and we expect pricing pressures to escalate should economic conditions deteriorate. An increase in price competition could result in a reduction of our profit margins. We may not be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers, higher sales, cost reductions, or otherwise. Such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of our market share, reduced sales, and reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the imposition of related public health measures and restrictions have, and may in the future, further materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a global emergency on January 30, 2020, with respect to the outbreak and several countries, including the United States, Japan and Australia have initiated travel restrictions to and from China. The impacts of the outbreak are unknown and rapidly evolving.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused material disruptions to our business and operations and could cause material disruptions to our business and operations in the future as a result of, among other things, quarantines, worker illness, worker absenteeism as a result of illness or other factors, social distancing measures and other travel, health-related, business or other restrictions.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers. This outbreak has resulted in the extended shutdown of certain businesses, which may in turn result in disruptions or delays to our supply chain. These may include disruptions from the temporary closure of third-party supplier and manufacturer facilities, interruptions in product supply or restrictions on the export or shipment of our products. Any disruption of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers will likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to the business and operations of our customers. Certain of our customers have been, and may in the future be, required to close down or operate at a lower capacity. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, a decrease in orders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in collecting amounts owed to us.\nThis widespread health crisis has adversely affected the global economy, and may result in a sustained economic downturn that could impact demand for our products going forward.\nThe future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and there is no assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on the future results of the Company. The extent of the impact will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain COVID-19.\nInstability in economic conditions and government spending may adversely affect our business and reduce our operating results.\nOur business has been affected by changes in economic conditions that are outside of our control, including reductions in business investment, loss of consumer confidence, and fiscal uncertainty at both federal and state government levels. Reductions in federal government spending may result in significant reductions in program funding. Uncertainty also exists regarding expected economic conditions both globally and in the United States, and future delays or reductions in IT spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our financial results.\nDespite the recent increase in general economic optimism, there is always a risk that heightened economic expectations may not be realized. Economic instability may arise, and it is difficult to predict to what extent our business may be adversely affected. However, if IT spending should again decline, we are likely to experience an adverse impact, which may be material on our business and our results of operations.\nWe acquire a majority of our products for resale from a limited number of vendors. The loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe acquire a majority of our products for resale from a limited number of vendors. The loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business. We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and increasingly indirectly through distributors and other sources. Although we purchase from a diverse vendor base, product purchases from Ingram Micro, Inc., Synnex and HP Inc. accounted for approximately 21%, 15% and 12% respectively, of our total product purchases in 2020. No other singular vendor supplied more than 10% of our total product purchases in the year 2020. In addition to these vendors, product purchases, whether purchased directly or from a wholesale distributor, from Dell and Tech Data comprised a total of 66% of our product purchases in 2020. If we are unable to acquire products, or if we experienced a change in business relationship with any of these vendors, we could experience a short-term disruption in the availability of products, and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nProducts manufactured by HP Inc. collectively represented approximately 18% of our net sales in 2020. We believe that in the event we experience either a short-term or permanent disruption of supply of HP products, such disruption would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantially all of our contracts and arrangements with our vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or us without notice or upon short notice. Most of our product vendors provide us with trade credit, of which the net amount outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $266.8 million. Termination, interruption, or contraction of relationships with our vendors, including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nSome product manufacturers either do not permit us to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to national solutions providers such as us. An element of our business strategy is to continue increasing our participation in first-to-market purchase opportunities. The availability of certain desired products, especially in the direct marketing channel, has been constrained in the past. We could experience a material adverse effect to our business if we are unable to source first-to-market purchases or similar opportunities, or if significant availability constraints reoccur.\nVirtualization of IT resources and applications, including networks, servers, applications, and data storage may disrupt or alter our traditional distribution models.\nOur customers can access, through a cloud-based platform, business-critical solutions without the significant initial capital investment required for dedicated infrastructure. Growing demand for the development of cloud-based solutions may reduce demand for some of our existing hardware products. If the transition to an environment characterized by cloud-based computing and software being delivered as a service progresses, we will likely increase investments in this area before knowing whether our sales forecasts will accurately reflect customer demand for these products, services,\nand solutions. We may not be able to effectively compete using these virtual distribution models. Our inability to compete effectively with current or future virtual distribution model competitors, or adapt to a cloud-based environment, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe methods of distributing IT products are changing, and such changes may negatively impact us and our business.\nThe manner in which IT hardware and software is distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale have emerged, including distribution through cloud-based and SaaS solutions. In addition, hardware and software manufacturers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end users. From time to time, certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts. These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers. Some of our vendors, including Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, currently sell some of their products directly to end users and have stated their intentions to increase the level of such direct sales. In addition, manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users. An increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs, or our inability to effectively adapt our business to increased electronic distribution of products and services to end users could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend heavily on third-party shippers to deliver our products to customers and would be adversely affected by a service interruption by these shippers.\nMany of our customers elect to have their purchases shipped by an interstate common carrier, such as United Parcel Service, Inc., or UPS, or FedEx Corporation. A strike or other interruption in service by these shippers could adversely affect our ability to market or deliver products to customers on a timely basis.\nWe may experience increases in shipping and postage costs, which may adversely affect our business if we are not able to pass such increases on to our customers.\nShipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of our business. Increases in postal or shipping rates could significantly impact the cost of shipping customer orders and mailing our catalogs. Postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically, and we have no control over future increases. We have a long-term contract with UPS, and believe that we have negotiated favorable shipping rates with our carriers. While we generally invoice customers for shipping and handling charges, we may not be able to pass on to our customers the full cost, including any future increases in the cost, of commercial delivery services, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors.\nSome product manufacturers and distributors provide us with incentives such as supplier reimbursements, payment discounts, price protection, rebates, and other similar arrangements. The increasingly competitive technology reseller market has already resulted in the following:\n\u25cf reduction or elimination of some of these incentive programs;\n\u25cf more restrictive price protection and other terms; and\n\u25cf reduced advertising allowances and incentives.\nMany product suppliers provide us with advertising allowances, and in exchange, we feature their products on our website and in other marketing vehicles. These vendor allowances, to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of incremental and identifiable costs, are offset against SG&A expenses. Advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of sales or inventory. In the past, we have experienced a decrease in the level of vendor consideration available to us from certain manufacturers. The level of such\nconsideration we receive from some manufacturers may decline in the future. Such a decline could decrease our gross profit and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nShould our financial performance not meet expectations, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles.\nWe test goodwill for impairment each year and more frequently if potential impairment indicators arise. Although the fair value of our Business Solutions and Enterprise Solutions reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value at our annual impairment test, should the financial performance of a reporting unit not meet expectations due to the economy or otherwise, we would likely adjust downward expected future operating results and cash flows. Such adjustment may result in a determination that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. This determination may in turn require that we record a significant non-cash charge to earnings to reduce the $73.6 million aggregate carrying amount of goodwill held by our Business Solutions and Enterprise Solutions reporting units, resulting in a negative effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to inventory obsolescence due to the rapid technological changes occurring in the IT industry.\nThe market for IT products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements. Our success depends in large part on our ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of customers in that marketplace. In order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts, we have and may continue to carry increased inventory levels of certain products. By so doing, we are subject to the increased risk of inventory obsolescence. Also, in order to implement our business strategy, we intend to continue, among other things, placing larger than typical inventory stocking orders of selected products and increasing our participation in first-to-market purchase opportunities. We may also, from time to time, make large inventory purchases of certain end-of-life products, which would increase the risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we sometimes acquire special purchase products without return privileges. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory. Manufacturers have limited return rights and have taken steps to reduce their inventory exposure by supporting \u201cconfigure-to-order\u201d programs authorizing distributors and resellers to assemble computer hardware under the manufacturers\u2019 brands. These actions reduce the costs to manufacturers and shift the burden of inventory risk to resellers like us, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are exposed to accounts receivable risk and if customers fail to timely pay amounts due to us our business, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our Net sales, typically on 30-day payment terms. We are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased, or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced. This risk is heightened during periods of global or industry-specific economic downturn or uncertainty, during periods of rising interest rates or, in the case of public sector customers, during periods of budget constraints. Significant failures of customers to timely pay all amounts due to us could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and, more generally, skilled personnel in all areas of our business and the loss of key persons or the inability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel could adversely impact our business.\nOur future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executives and other key management personnel. The current environment for qualified management personnel in the computer products industry is very competitive, and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on our business. Our success and plans for future growth will also depend on our ability to hire, train, and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business, especially sales representatives and technical support personnel. We may not be able to attract, train, and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve our business objectives.\nNatural disasters, terrorism, and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters, terrorism, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors, and customers. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services or products to our customers, or to receive products from our suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. In the event of a natural disaster or other business interruption, significant recovery time and substantial expenditures could be required to resume operations and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Technology, Data and Intellectual Property\nCyberattacks or the failure to safeguard personal information and our information technology systems could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is heavily dependent upon information technology networks and systems. Internal or external attacks on those networks and systems could disrupt our normal operations centers and impede our ability to provide critical products and services to our customers and clients, subjecting us to liability under our contracts and damaging our reputation.\nOur business also involves the use, storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information about our employees, our clients and customers of our clients. While we take measures to protect the security of, and prevent unauthorized access to, our systems and personal and proprietary information, the security controls for our systems, as well as other security practices we follow, may not prevent improper access to, or disclosure of, personally identifiable or proprietary information. Furthermore, the evolving nature of threats to data security, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists, including computer viruses, malware, phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering, and forgery make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. We have experienced attacks and attempted attacks that have generally been in the form of active intrusion attempts from the internet, passive vulnerability mapping from the internet, and internal malware and or phishing attempts delivered through user actions.\nBreaches in security could expose us, our supply chain, our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions, a risk of public disclosure, loss or misuse of this information. Security breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation. Moreover, media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment, even if inaccurate, could adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Such breaches, costs and consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by system failures, interruption, integration issues, or security lapses of our information technology systems or those of our third-party providers.\nOur ability to effectively manage our business depends significantly on our information systems and infrastructure as well as, in certain instances those of our business partners and third-party providers. The failure of our current systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, including integration of upgrades to better meet the changing needs of our customers, could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers. In addition, cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to company or customer data, denial of service attacks, the processing of fraudulent transactions, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. In our case, these attacks and attempted attacks have generally been in the form of active intrusion attempts from the internet, passive vulnerability mapping from the internet, and internal malware and or phishing attempts delivered through user actions. Although we have in place various processes, procedures,\nand controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent a material security threat or mitigate these risks for our customers. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to disruption of our operations or loss of sensitive information as well as subject us to regulatory actions, litigation, or damage to our reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Similar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third-party providers. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities of our business partners and third-party providers may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly impact our systems.\nWe rely on the continued development of electronic commerce and Internet infrastructure development.\nWe continue to have increasing levels of sales made through our e-commerce sites. The on-line experience for our clients continues to improve, but the competitive nature of the e-commerce channel also continues to increase. Growth of our overall sales is dependent on customers continuing to expand their on-line purchases in addition to traditional channels to purchase products and services. We cannot accurately predict the rate at which on-line purchases will expand.\nOur success in growing our Internet business will depend in large part upon our development of an increasingly sophisticated e-commerce experience and infrastructure. Increasing customer sophistication requires that we provide additional website features and functionality in order to be competitive in the marketplace and maintain market share. We will continue to iterate our website features, but we cannot predict future trends and required functionality or our adoption rate for customer preferences. As the number of on-line users continues to grow, such growth may impact the performance of our existing Internet infrastructure, which would adversely impact our business.\nWe could experience Internet and other system failures which would interfere with our ability to process orders.\nWe depend on the accuracy and proper use of our management information systems, including our telephone system. Many of our key functions depend on the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by our management information systems, including:\n\u2022 our ability to purchase, sell, and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis;\n\u2022 our ability to manage inventory and accounts receivable collection; and\n\u2022 our ability to maintain operations.\nOur management information systems require continual upgrades to most effectively manage our operations and customer database. Although we maintain some redundant systems, with full data backup, a significant component of our computer and telecommunications hardware is located in a single facility in New Hampshire, and a substantial interruption in our management information systems or in our telephone communication systems, including those resulting from extreme weather and natural disasters, as well as power loss, telecommunications failure, or similar events, would substantially hinder our ability to process customer orders and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPrivacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe mail catalogs and other promotional materials to names in our customer database and to potential customers whose names we obtain from rented or exchanged mailing lists. Public concern regarding the protection of personal information has subjected the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information to increased scrutiny. Legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting the use of rented or exchanged mailing lists could negatively affect our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nWe are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits, which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, employment, tort and other litigation.\nWe are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business, either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services, in the form of cease-and-desist letters, licensing inquiries, lawsuits and other communications and demands. In our industry, such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased. Increasingly, many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue, but we may also be subject to demands from inventors, competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue, lost profits and/or an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities, including selling certain products or services.\nWe also are subject to proceedings, investigations and audits by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities, including as a result of our sales to governmental entities. We also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts.\nCurrent and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. In addition, these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations. Litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe failure to comply with our public sector contracts could result in, among other things, fines or liabilities.\nRevenues from the Public Sector Solutions segment are derived from sales to federal, state, and local government departments and agencies, as well as to educational institutions, through various contracts and open market sales. Government contracting is a highly regulated area. Noncompliance with government procurement regulations or contract provisions could result in civil, criminal, and administrative liability, including substantial monetary fines or damages, termination of government contracts, and suspension, debarment, or ineligibility from doing business with the government. Our current arrangements with these government agencies allow them to cancel orders with little or no notice and do not require them to purchase products from us in the future. The effect of any of these possible actions by any government department or agency could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face uncertainties relating to unclaimed property and the collection of state sales and use tax.\nWe collect and remit sales and use taxes in states in which we have either voluntarily registered or have a physical presence. Various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales and use taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents. Many states have adopted rules that require companies and their affiliates to register in those states as a condition of doing business with those state agencies. Our three sales companies are registered in substantially all states, however, if a state were to determine that our earlier contacts with that state exceeded the constitutionally permitted contacts, the state could assess a tax liability relating to our prior year sales. Various states have from time to time initiated unclaimed property audits of our company escheatment practices.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile. Our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares, due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which may be caused by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the following:\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022 downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022 future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022 market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022 investors\u2019 perceptions of our prospects;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022 changes in key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. In the past, securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price.\nWe are controlled by one principal stockholder.\nPatricia Gallup, our principal stockholder, beneficially owns or controls, in the aggregate, approximately 56% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Because of her beneficial stock ownership, the stockholder can continue to elect the members of the Board of Directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting. Similarly, such stockholder can control decisions to adopt, amend, or repeal our charter and our bylaws, or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders and prevent a takeover of us by one or more third parties, or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party, which could deprive our stockholders of a control premium that might otherwise be realized by her in connection with an acquisition of our Company. Such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our unaffiliated public stockholders.", "PERMNO": 85886, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "CNXN"}
