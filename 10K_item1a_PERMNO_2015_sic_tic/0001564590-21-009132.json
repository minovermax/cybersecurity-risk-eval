{"cik": "811596", "company": "KAISER ALUMINUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the risks described below are those that we believe are material to our company. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our securities.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could in the future materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe novel strain of the coronavirus identified in China in late 2019, and now affecting the global community, has impacted and is expected to continue to impact our operations. The full nature and extent of the impact is highly uncertain. Among other things, uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic include the duration of the pandemic and the actions, or perception of actions that may be taken, to contain or treat its impact by governments and others, including declarations of states of emergency, business closures, manufacturing restrictions and prolonged periods of travel, commercial and/or other similar restrictions and limitations.\nFurthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain its spread, our customers have been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand, which has and could in the future negatively impact our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures implemented to contain its spread, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity or capability to enable the manufacture of our products according to our schedule and specifications. Because of impacts to suppliers\u2019 operations, we may need to seek alternate suppliers, which may be more expensive, may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted our internal operations by heightening the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise not be permitted or be unable to work and exposing us to cyber and other risks associated with a large number of our employees working remotely. Certain of our facilities have experienced temporary work disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant or frequent disruptions in the future. We may need to further reduce our workforce as a result of declines in our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and any such reduction would cause us to incur costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we would be able to rehire our workforce in the event our business experiences a subsequent recovery.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and its duration and ultimate disruption to our customers and to our supply chain, and related financial impact to us, cannot be estimated at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a more severe adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, weaker economic conditions generally could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets, or our ability to raise additional capital, if needed.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) and on December 27, 2020 he signed a second COVID-19 pandemic relief bill (\u201cSecond CARES Act\u201d) into law. The CARES Act and the Second CARES Act, among other things, include provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. We continue to monitor the impact of these relief packages and, where there are opportunities to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and employees, we have taken action to apply or invoke these regulations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused downturns in the commercial aerospace industry, which has adversely affected our business, and could cause additional downturns in the automotive and ground transportation industries, which would further adversely affect our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from products sold to the aerospace and automotive and ground transportation industries. Concerns regarding and measures implemented in response to pandemics of infectious disease have and could further cause changes in global travel patterns, negatively influencing demand for new commercial aircraft and other vehicles, resulting in cancellations or deferrals of orders and/or decreases in new deliveries. Moreover, because new automotive vehicle demand is tied closely to overall economic strength, economic uncertainty and/or increased unemployment that results from the COVID-19 pandemic or measures undertaken in response could lead to weak demand for, or lower production of, new cars, light trucks, SUVs and heavy duty vehicles and trailers, which, in turn, could adversely affect demand for our products. For example, several of our automotive customers have temporarily suspended operations in the past and could do so again in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or in accordance with governmental requirements. Despite existing backlogs, adverse developments resulting from the pandemic may lead to reduced demand for our products, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nWe compete with others in the fabricated products segment of the aluminum industry based upon quality, availability, price, customer service and delivery performance. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, have greater financial resources than we do, operate more facilities than we do, are geographically closer to our customers than we are, employ more efficient or advanced technologies than we do or have other strategic advantages. Additionally, new parties may become capable of\nmanufacturing similar products and qualifying them with our customers, which could lead to further competitive pressure. Competitors\u2019 facilities located in certain other countries may have a manufacturing cost advantage compared to our facilities, which are located in the United States and Canada. Such foreign competitors may sell products similar to our products at lower prices as a result of having lower manufacturing costs or due to currency exchange rates that periodically favor foreign competition. Some foreign competitors may also dump their products in the United States and Canada in violation of existing trade laws. We may not be able to compete by differentiating ourselves based on the quality, availability and delivery of our products or our customer service. Additionally, we may not be able to reduce our cost structure and our selling prices to be competitive with others, and tariffs introduced to protect manufacturers in the United States and Canada from foreign price competition may not be fully effective. Increased competition could cause a reduction in demand for our products and our shipment volumes, our product pricing or both shipment volumes and product pricing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nReductions in demand for our products may be more severe than, and may occur prior to, reductions in demand for our customers\u2019 products.\nMost of our products undergo further fabrication by other parties before being deployed in their end uses. In particular, our Aero/HS products undergo numerous stages of further fabrication or assembly by a number of parties in the supply chain, often over the course of many months. The lead time from when we sell our Aero/HS product to when the finished product is installed on an aircraft often exceeds a year. Due to this long lead time, demand for our products may increase prior to demand for our customers\u2019 products or may decrease when our customers experience or anticipate softening demand for their products. Our customers typically respond to reduced demand for their products by depleting their inventory until their inventory falls to a new desired level. This causes a greater reduction in demand for our products than our customers experience for their products. Further, the reduction in demand for our products can be exacerbated if our customers\u2019 inventory levels had been higher than normal, if production is delayed for specific commercial airframe models, if our customers previously had purchased products from us at committed sales contract volumes that exceeded their actual need or for other reasons. The amplified reduction in demand for our products while our customers consume their inventory to meet their business needs (destocking) may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials.\nOur products compete with other materials for use in various customer applications. For instance, the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of titanium, composites and carbon fiber materials as alternatives to aluminum to reduce aircraft weight and increase fuel efficiency. Additionally, while the automotive industry has continued to increase use of aluminum in vehicle production to reduce vehicle weight and increase fuel efficiency, manufacturers may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications and rely on improved drivetrain technology, more efficient engines, aerodynamics or other measures to achieve fuel efficiency goals. The willingness of customers to use materials other than aluminum could adversely affect the demand for our products, particularly our Aero/HS products and Automotive Extrusions, and thus could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers may reduce their demand for our products if the government relaxes fuel efficiency standards or if oil prices remain low for a protracted period of time.\nEfficient use of fossil fuels partially drives demand for aluminum in transportation applications. The USEPA, other federal regulatory agencies and regulatory agencies of certain states have generally sought to limit growth of fossil fuel usage by establishing stricter fuel efficiency standards. In addition, newly elected and/or changing administrations could accelerate efforts to not only limit, but reduce, fossil fuel usage and carbon emissions beyond what may be technologically possible for certain products and manufacturing processes and revisit or reverse the environmental agendas of previous administrations with respect to previously established fuel efficiency standards. Additionally, in periods of lower oil prices, the economic benefits of replacing older aircraft and automobiles with more fuel-efficient models are less compelling. A relaxation of fuel efficiency standards by the regulatory agencies or an extended period of moderate oil prices could reduce demand for new more efficient aircraft and automobiles, which could adversely affect the demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe commercial aerospace industry is cyclical and downturns in the commercial aerospace industry could adversely affect our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry. Notwithstanding a secular growth trend spanning nearly two decades, the aerospace industry is highly cyclical. Numerous factors that influence demand for new commercial aircraft could result in cancellations or deferrals of aircraft orders and a global decrease in new commercial aircraft deliveries. These factors have recently included the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global travel, but also include but are not limited to: (i) declines or reduced growth trends in global travel and airline passenger traffic; (ii) the rate of replacement of older\naircraft with more fuel efficient aircraft; (iii) changing airline strategies affecting preferences for single-aisle aircraft models as opposed to twin-aisle or jumbo aircraft models; (iv) airline industry profitability; (v) the state of regional and global economies; (vi) concerns regarding terrorism or the threat of terrorism; (vii) concerns regarding new pandemics of infectious disease; and (viii) safety concerns with newly introduced and existing aircraft. Despite existing backlogs, adverse developments in any one or more of these influencing factors may lead to reduced demand for new aircraft that utilize our products, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nReductions in defense spending for aerospace and non-aerospace military applications could adversely affect demand for our products.\nOur products are used in a wide variety of military applications, including military aircraft, armored vehicles and ordnance. Certain military programs are used by the U.S. armed forces, as well as by the defense forces of our allied foreign powers. Military programs that currently use or in the future could use our products may be subject to changes in military strategy and government priorities. Further, while many of the U.S. government programs span several years, they are often funded annually, and funding is generally subject to congressional appropriations. When U.S. and foreign allied governments are faced with competing national priorities, such as addressing financial or spending crises or public health emergencies, there can be significant pressure to reduce defense spending, which could reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDownturns in the automotive and ground transportation industries could adversely affect our business.\nThe demand for our Automotive Extrusions and many of our general engineering and other industrial products is dependent on the production of cars, light trucks, SUVs and heavy duty vehicles and trailers in North America. The automotive industry is highly cyclical, as new vehicle demand is dependent on consumer spending and is tied closely to the overall strength of the North American economy. Even with the automotive industry\u2019s growing use of aluminum to reduce vehicle weight, weak demand for, or lower production of, new cars, light trucks, SUVs and heavy duty vehicles and trailers could adversely affect the demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in consumer demand for particular motor vehicles could adversely affect our business.\nSensitivity to fuel prices, an increased preference for environmentally friendly alternatives and other consumer preferences can influence consumer demand for motor vehicles that have a higher content of the aluminum Automotive Extrusions that we supply. The loss of business with respect to, or a lack of commercial success of, one or more particular vehicle models for which we are a significant supplier could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.\nWe depend on a core group of significant customers.\nIn 2020, Reliance and Boeing were our two largest customers, representing approximately 26% and 11%, respectively, of our net sales. Our five largest customers in total accounted for approximately 54% of our 2020 net sales. Most of these customers have one or more sizable sales agreements with us. If one or more of these customers experienced a prolonged period of adverse demand, depressed business activity or financial distress, if any of these customers breached or sought relief from its contractual obligations under its sales agreements with us or if any of these customer relationships otherwise ended or materially deteriorated and such lost business was not successfully replaced, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe experience fluctuation in certain costs that we cannot pass through to our customers and face pressure from our customers on pricing.\nWe are unable to pass fluctuations of certain costs through to our customers, including the cost of energy, certain raw materials and freight. Further, cost cutting initiatives that many of our customers have adopted generally result in downward pressure on pricing. If we are unable to generate sufficient productivity improvements and cost savings in the future to offset reductions in our selling prices and increases in our costs that we cannot pass through to our customers, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO GEO-POLITICAL RISKS.\nOur industry is very sensitive to foreign economic, regulatory and political factors that may adversely affect our business.\nWe import primary aluminum from, and manufacture fabricated products used in, foreign countries. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by numerous factors in the politically and economically diverse jurisdictions: (i) from which our input materials are sourced; (ii) in which we operate; (iii) in which our customers operate; or (iv) in which our products are consumed or further fabricated. Such factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe adoption of tariffs, duties and other forms of taxation;\n\u2022\ntrade disputes;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of controls on prices, exports and/or imports, including quotas;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of other restrictions on supply chains in connection with global health pandemics;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of currency restrictions;\n\u2022\ninflation relative to the United States and related fluctuations in currency and interest rates;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation in the countries in which we operate, service customers or purchase raw materials;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest and labor problems;\n\u2022\nthe nationalization or appropriation of rights or other assets; and\n\u2022\nacts or threats of war or terrorism.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.\nWe may experience difficulties in the launch or production ramp-up of new products which could adversely affect our business.\nAs we ramp up manufacturing processes for newly introduced products, we may experience difficulties, including manufacturing disruptions, delays or other complications, which could adversely impact our ability to serve our customers, our reputation, our costs of production and, ultimately, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnplanned events may interrupt our production operations, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe production of fabricated aluminum products is subject to unplanned events such as explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures, labor disruptions, transportation interruptions, public utilities interruptions and supply interruptions. Operational interruptions could significantly curtail the production capacity of a facility for a period of time. We have redundant capacity and capability to produce many of our extruded products within our manufacturing platform to mitigate our business risk from such interruptions, but interruptions at our Trentwood facility where our production of plate and sheet is concentrated, could significantly compromise our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Delayed delivery of our products to customers who require on-time delivery from us may cause customers to purchase alternative products at a higher cost, reschedule their own production or incur other incremental costs. Customers may be able to pursue financial claims against us for their incremental costs, and we may incur costs to correct such problems in addition to any liability resulting from such claims. Interruptions may also harm our reputation among actual and potential customers, potentially resulting in a loss of business. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by such events.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS AND INITIATIVES.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our productivity enhancement and cost reduction initiatives that are necessary to offset competitive price pressure.\nOver time, we have experienced pricing pressure on many of our products and anticipate continued pricing pressure in the future. Ongoing and heightened competitive price pressure makes it increasingly important for us to be a low cost producer. Although we have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake productivity enhancement and cost reduction initiatives, including significant investments in our facilities to improve our manufacturing efficiency, cost and product quality, we cannot make assurances that we will complete all of these initiatives, that we will fully realize the estimated cost savings from such activities, that short-to-medium term improvements from new efficiencies and lower cost structure achieved will become permanent or that we will be able to continue to reduce cost and increase productivity over the long term.\nOur investment and other expansion projects may not be completed, start up as scheduled or deliver the expected capacity and other benefits.\nOur ability to complete our investment and expansion projects and the timing and costs of doing so are subject to various risks associated with all major construction projects, many of which are beyond our control, including technical or mechanical problems and economic conditions. Additionally, the start-up of operations after such projects have been completed can be complicated and costly. If we are unable to fully complete these projects, if the actual costs for these projects exceed our expectations, if the start-up phase after completion is more complicated than anticipated or if the capacity and other benefits of these projects are less than anticipated, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the benefits of the Warrick Rolling Mill acquisition.\nOur recently announced Warrick Rolling Mill acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or that we will be able to complete the Warrick Rolling Mill acquisition within the planned timeframe or at all. Furthermore, completing the Warrick Rolling Mill acquisition could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock. Additional risks associated with the Warrick Rolling Mill acquisition may include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention from our existing business;\n\u2022\nchallenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of the acquired business with those of our existing operations;\n\u2022\nliability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance;\n\u2022\ngreater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results;\n\u2022\ndifficulties achieving anticipated operational improvements; and\n\u2022\nincurrence of indebtedness to finance other acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets in the future.\nIf we fail to successfully integrate the Warrick Rolling Mill, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and/or it may have adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO COMMODITY-RELATED PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum.\nOur largest inputs to produce fabricated aluminum products are primary aluminum and recycled scrap aluminum. Primary aluminum pricing fluctuates in response to global supply and demand and also reflects the impact of duties and tariffs imposed by the United States and certain other countries. Recycled scrap aluminum is generally priced at a discount to primary aluminum that loosens and tightens in response to regional aluminum scrap supply and demand. The timing and magnitude of changes in market pricing for primary and scrap aluminum are largely unpredictable. Our pricing structures for fabricated aluminum products generally allow us to pass fluctuations in the price of primary aluminum through to our customers so that we can minimize our exposure to metal price risk. However, competitive dynamics for certain of our high value added products may limit the amount or delay the timing of selling price increases on our products to recover our increased aluminum costs, resulting in a time lag during which we may be partially exposed to metal price risk. If these events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the market price for primary aluminum were to remain high for an extended period of time, the corresponding increase in our selling price for our fabricated products may cause some of our customers to switch to other materials in lieu of our products, causing sales of our fabricated aluminum products to decrease, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the pricing and availability of recycled scrap aluminum.\nWe can efficiently use certain forms of recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of primary aluminum and alloying metals in our operations because recycled scrap aluminum trades at a discount to primary aluminum. The size of the discount to primary aluminum depends on regional scrap aluminum supply and demand dynamics. Larger discounts, generally available in periods of ample regional scrap aluminum supply relative to demand, enhance the economic advantage to us of using recycled scrap aluminum in lieu of primary aluminum and alloying metals. The timing and magnitude of changes in scrap discounts relative to primary aluminum are largely unpredictable. If the availability of recycled scrap aluminum in our regional markets were to tighten, scrap discounts relative to primary aluminum could decline and the amount of recycled scrap aluminum we could procure for use in our operations could decline, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nReduced pricing for aluminum can reduce our borrowing availability and cause our liquidity to decline.\nLower aluminum prices reduce the market value of our inventory and generally cause a reduction in our accounts receivable as we pass through a lower underlying metal price to our customers. Because the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions party thereto (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) is determined by the value of our receivables and inventory, which serve as collateral for the facility, a reduction in aluminum prices can reduce our borrowing availability and our liquidity, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur hedging programs have been and could continue to be adversely impacted by fluctuations as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe use forward contracts to protect against fluctuations in commodity price and currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of these hedges depends, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future product demand and related cash flow. Due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses, our customers\u2019 businesses are subject to many uncertainties and, as a result, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, unanticipated volatility in product demand and related cash flows. When we experience such volatility or are otherwise unable to make accurate predictions with respect to our forward swaps designated as cash flow or fair value hedges, such hedging activities may become ineffective. The early settlement, reclassification of cumulative losses and/or the periodic adjustment to fair value through Net income associated with ineffective hedging activities could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur hedging programs may limit the income and cash flows we would otherwise expect to receive if our hedging program were not in place and may otherwise affect our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into hedging transactions to limit our exposure to risks relating to changes in the market prices of primary aluminum, certain alloying metals, natural gas and electricity, as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To the extent that market prices or exchange rates at the expiration of these hedging transactions would have been more favorable to us than the fixed prices or rates established by these hedging transactions, our income and cash flows will be lower than they otherwise would have been. Our liquidity could also be adversely affected to the extent we incur margin calls from our hedging counterparties due to the market price of the underlying commodity or the foreign currency exchange rates deviating adversely from fixed, floor or ceiling prices or rates established by our outstanding hedging transactions. Our failure to satisfy certain covenants in the underlying hedging documents or the occurrence of an event of default thereunder could also trigger margin calls that could adversely impact our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our hedging programs also expose us to the creditworthiness of our hedging counterparties, which is inherently difficult to assess and can change quickly and dramatically. Non-performance by a hedging counterparty could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS.\nCovenants and events of default in our debt instruments could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2028 (\u201c4.625% Senior Notes\u201d) and 6.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (\u201c6.50% Senior Notes\u201d) contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nissue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, restrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility require us in certain circumstances to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under our Revolving Credit Facility or under the indentures governing the 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt. A payment default or an acceleration following an event of default under our Revolving Credit Facility or our indentures for our 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes could trigger an event of default under the other indebtedness obligation, as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could result in the principal of and the accrued and unpaid interest on all such debt becoming due and payable. In addition, an event of default under our Revolving Credit Facility could permit the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay any amounts due and payable under our Revolving Credit Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business and grow in accordance with our strategy;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nIn addition, our financial results, our level of indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of any additional or replacement financing.\nMore detailed descriptions of our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing our 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes are included in filings made by us with the SEC, along with the documents themselves, which provide the full text of these covenants.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments contain significant qualifications and exceptions.\nWhile our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes place limitations on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem capital stock, make loans and investments and incur additional indebtedness, investors should be aware that these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions. The aggregate amount of payments made or incremental debt incurred in compliance with these limitations could be substantial.\nAs indicated above, more detailed descriptions of our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing our 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes are included in filings made by us with the SEC, along with the documents themselves, which provide the full text of these covenants.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments on our debt obligations or to refinance such obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the interest, principal and premium, if any, on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our indebtedness or seek additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our\nability to raise debt or certain forms of equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate asset dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our 4.625% Senior Notes, 6.50% Senior Notes or our Revolving Credit Facility. Accordingly, repayments of our 4.625% Senior Notes, 6.50% Senior Notes and amounts due under our Revolving Credit Facility are dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of our 4.625% Senior Notes, 6.50% Senior Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility have no obligation to pay amounts due on the 4.625% Senior Notes, 6.50% Senior Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required interest and principal payments on the 4.625% Senior Notes, the 6.50% Senior Notes or our Revolving Credit Facility, or other indebtedness.\nOur inability to receive distributions from our subsidiaries, otherwise generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could adversely affect our business.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 63% of our employees were represented by labor unions under labor contracts with varying durations and expiration dates. Employees at our Trentwood and Newark, Ohio facilities are represented by the USW under a single contract that extends through September 2025. The USW also represents employees at five other facilities, four of which have contracts expiring in 2021. As part of any labor negotiation, the future wages, healthcare benefits and excise taxes that may result therefrom, and other benefits that we agree to, could adversely affect our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, negotiations could divert management attention, result in unsatisfactory terms and conditions, fail in coming to any agreement at all or result in strikes, work stoppages or other union-initiated work actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, the existence of labor agreements may not prevent such union-initiated work actions.\nOur participation in multi-employer union pension plans may have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe participate in several multi-employer pension plans pursuant to our collective bargaining agreements. Our contribution amounts to these plans were established by collective bargaining and, along with benefit levels and related items, will be issues in our future collective bargaining negotiations. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe some of these plans are underfunded and may require increased contributions from participating employers to fill the funding shortfall in the future. An employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability for the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. The failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can increase the burden of the remaining participating employers to make up the funding shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The increase or decrease in our contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend on our future collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, actions of other participating employers, government regulations and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among other factors.\nThe USW has director nomination rights through which it may influence us, and interests of the USW may not align with our interests or the interests of our stockholders, debt holders and other stakeholders.\nPursuant to agreements we have with the USW, the USW has the right, subject to certain limitations, to nominate candidates which, if elected, would constitute 40% of our Board of Directors through December 31, 2025. As a result, the directors nominated by the USW have a significant voice in the decisions of our Board of Directors. It is possible that the USW may seek to extend the term of the agreement and its right to nominate board members beyond 2025.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED RISKS.\nEnvironmental compliance, cleanup and damage claims may decrease our cash flow and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations with respect to, among other things: (i) air and water emissions and discharges; (ii) the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and (iii) the release of hazardous or toxic substances, pollutants and contaminants into the environment. In addition to environmental laws and regulations, environmental activists, lobbyists and consumers have targeted manufacturers for the purported impact of their operations on the environment. Compliance with existing and new environmental laws and standards or the implications of any actions by third parties are and may continue to be costly.\nWe have accrued and will accrue for costs that are reasonably expected to be incurred based on available information with respect to fines, penalties and expenses for alleged breaches of environmental laws in connection with our existing operations and investigations and environmental cleanup activities with respect to certain of our former operations. However, actual costs could exceed accrued amounts, perhaps significantly, and such expenditures could occur sooner than anticipated, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to new claims from governmental authorities or third parties related to alleged injuries to the environment, human health or natural resources, including claims with respect to waste disposal sites, the cleanup of sites currently or formerly used by us or exposure of individuals to hazardous materials. New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may also be enacted, including government mandated green initiatives and limitations on carbon emissions that increase the cost or complexity of compliance. Costs related to any new investigation, cleanup or other remediation, fines or penalties, resolution of third-party claims or compliance with new or amended laws and regulations may be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernmental regulation relating to greenhouse gas emissions may subject us to significant new costs and restrictions on our operations.\nLaws enacted by the U.S. Congress or policies of the USEPA could regulate greenhouse gas emissions through cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes or other programs under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas, pay carbon based taxes, make significant capital investments, alter manufacturing practices or curtail production. In addition, several states, including the state of Washington, in which we have manufacturing operations, have considered and continue to consider various greenhouse gas regulation and reduction programs through legislative proposals, executive orders and ballot initiatives. Certain of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of electricity and natural gas and certain of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas above certain minimum thresholds that have or may be imposed. While certain of our operations, including the melting of aluminum scrap, require the use of natural gas to achieve the required temperatures, greenhouse gas regulations could restrict our access to natural gas and limit our ability to use natural gas and increase the price we pay for natural gas and electricity, any one of which could significantly increase our costs, reduce our competitiveness in the global economy or otherwise adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, operate our business and communicate among our locations and with our customers, suppliers and other interested parties. Such information technology systems are subject to: (i) interruption or damage from power outages; (ii) cyber security breaches and other types of unauthorized access and/or use; and (iii) cyberattacks in the form of computer viruses, worms, malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and other illegal or illicit means. Cyberattack and security breach strategies and methods continue to evolve and become more sophisticated. Accordingly, preventing intrusions and detecting successful intrusions and defending against them continues to be more difficult and requires ever-increasing vigilance.\nA breach in cyber security could result in manipulation and destruction of sensitive data, cause critical systems to malfunction, be damaged or shut down and lead to disruption of our operations and production downtimes, potentially for lengthy periods of time. Theft of personal or other confidential data and sensitive proprietary information could also occur as a result of a breach in cyber security, exposing us to costs and liabilities associated with privacy and data security laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, a breach could expose us, our customers, our suppliers and our employees to risks of misuse of such information. Such negative consequences of cyberattacks or security breaches could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations. The lost profits and increased costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured against or indemnified by other means.\nIn addition, from time to time we may implement new technology systems or replace and/or upgrade our current information technology systems. These upgrades or replacements may not improve our productivity to the levels anticipated and may subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with implementing, replacing and updating these systems, including potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into other existing systems. Our inability to prevent information technology system disruptions or to mitigate the impact of such disruptions could have an adverse effect on us.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO TAX REGULATIONS.\nWe may not be able to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes could be limited to the extent they expire before we fully utilize them or if changes in federal or certain state tax laws reduce or eliminate our ability to use them to offset income taxes. Additionally, a change in our ownership, specifically a change in ownership of more than 50% during any period of 36 consecutive months (\u201cownership change\u201d), as determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\u201cCode\u201d), could reduce our ability to fully use our net operating loss carryforwards and other significant tax attributes.\nFurthermore, our tax returns for certain past years are still subject to examination by taxing authorities, and the use of net operating loss carryforwards in future periods could trigger a review of attributes and other tax matters in years that are not otherwise subject to examination. After our net operating loss carryforwards and other significant tax attributes are fully utilized or if they become unavailable to us before we fully utilize them, our future income will not be shielded from federal and state income taxation and the funds otherwise available for general corporate purposes would be reduced.\nWe could engage in or approve transactions involving our common shares that impair the use of our federal income tax attributes.\nSection 382 of the Code affects our ability to use our federal income tax attributes, including our net operating loss carryforwards, following a more than 50% change in ownership during any period of 36 consecutive months, an ownership change, as determined under the Code. Certain transactions may be included in the calculation of an ownership change, including transactions involving our repurchase or issuance of our common shares. When we engage in or approve any transaction involving our common shares that may be included in the calculation of an ownership change, our practice is to first perform the calculations necessary to confirm that our ability to use our federal income tax attributes will not be affected. These calculations are complex and reflect certain necessary assumptions. Accordingly, it is possible that we could approve or engage in a transaction involving our common shares that causes an ownership change and inadvertently impairs the use of our federal income tax attributes. Furthermore, we may intentionally pursue a transaction that impairs the use of our federal income tax attributes if our strategy changes.\nWE MAY ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT AFFECT OUR COMMON STOCK.\nPayment of dividends may not continue in the future and our payment of dividends and stock repurchases are subject to restrictions.\nOur Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend for each quarter since the summer of 2007. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program. The future declaration and payment of dividends and the purchase of our shares under the repurchase program, if any, are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial and operating results, liquidity position, anticipated cash requirements and regulatory rules. Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures for our 4.625% Senior Notes and 6.50% Senior Notes impose limitations on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common shares. We can give no assurance that dividends will be declared and paid, that dividends will not be reduced or that purchases of our shares pursuant to our repurchase program will occur in the future.\nDelaware law and our governing documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage a change of control of our company or deter tender offers for our common stock. We are currently subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. These anti-takeover provisions impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. Additionally, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to determine the rights, preferences and privileges and restrictions of unissued shares of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. As a result, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation also divides our Board of Directors into three classes of directors who serve for staggered terms. A significant effect of a classified Board of Directors may be to deter hostile takeover attempts because an acquirer could experience delays in replacing a majority of directors. Moreover, stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER RISKS AS A PUBLICLY TRADED U.S. MANUFACTURING COMPANY.\nAs a publicly traded U.S. manufacturing company, we are subject to a variety of other risks, each of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows or the price of our common stock. These risks include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract and retain key management and other personnel and develop effective succession plans;\n\u2022\nregulations that subject us to additional capital or margin requirements or other restrictions that make it more difficult to hedge risks associated with our business or increase the cost of our hedging activities;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a wide variety of health and safety laws and regulations and changes to such laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nnew or modified legislation related to health care;\n\u2022\npursuing growth through acquisitions, including the ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates, finance and consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses;\n\u2022\nprotection of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, from infringement by others and the potential defense of claims, whether meritorious or not, alleging the unauthorized use of the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022\nthe exertion of influence over us, individually or collectively, by a few entities with concentrated ownership of our stock;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet the expectations of investors, including recent environmental, sustainability and governance expectations and other factors that are beyond the control of an individual company;\n\u2022\ndisputes, legal proceedings or investigations, whether meritorious or not, with respect to a variety of matters, including matters related to personal injury, employees, taxes, contracts and product liability;\n\u2022\ntaxation by multiple jurisdictions and the impact of such taxation on effective tax rate and the amount of taxes paid;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the potential impact of compliance failures.", "PERMNO": 91403, "SIC": 3350, "TIC": "KALU"}
