Risk Factors\nEach reader should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, because they could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, prospects, and the value of an investment in IS&S common stock.\nRisks Related to IS&S Business\nGrowth of the Company\u2019s customer base could be limited by delays or difficulties in completing development and introduction of planned products or product enhancements. If IS&S fails to enhance existing products, or to develop and achieve market acceptance for flat panel displays, flight management systems and other new products that meet customer requirements, its business, reputation and statements of income may be affected adversely.\nCurrently, IS&S spends a large portion of its R&D efforts in developing and marketing the FPDS, FMS, and complementary products. The Company\u2019s ability to grow and diversify its operations through introduction and sale of new products is dependent upon the continued success in product development and engineering activities, its sales and marketing efforts, and regulatory approvals to sell such products. Sales growth will depend in part on market acceptance of and demand for the FPDS, FMS, and future products. IS&S cannot be certain that it will be able to develop, introduce or market its FPDS, FMS, or other new products or product enhancements in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that any new products will receive market acceptance or necessary regulatory approval. In addition, the Company\u2019s business is dependent upon maintaining its reputation and relationships with existing customers. If the Company\u2019s performance does not meet its customers\u2019 expectations, the Company\u2019s reputation and its relationships could be damaged, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and statements of income.\nIn seeking new customers, the Company may have difficulty in displacing the products of incumbent competitors. IS&S cannot be assured that potential customers will accept its products or that existing customers will not abandon them.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may cause its stock price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 demand for products and/or delivery schedule changes by its customers;\n\u00b7 capital expenditure budgets of aircraft owners and operators, and appropriation cycles of the U.S. government;\n\u00b7 changes in the use of the Company\u2019s products, including air data systems, flat panel displays, and flight management systems;\n\u00b7 delays in introducing or obtaining government approval for new products;\n\u00b7 new product introductions by competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in IS&S pricing policies or pricing policies of competitors; and\n\u00b7 costs related to possible acquisition of technologies or businesses.\nThe loss of a key customer or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue is concentrated with a limited number of customers. During fiscal year 2015 IS&S derived 57% of revenue from the top five customers. IS&S expects a relatively small number of customers to account for a majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result of the concentrated customer base, a loss of one or more of these customers or a dispute or litigation with one of these key customers could affect adversely its revenue and results of operations. For example, in October 2014, Delta issued a cancellation notice to the Company purporting to terminate its contract with IS&S (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings). In addition, the Company monitors and evaluates the credit status of its customers and attempts to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a significant deterioration in the financial condition or bankruptcy filing of a key customer could affect adversely the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nContracts can be terminated by customers at any time and, therefore, may not result in sales.\nThe Company\u2019s retrofit projects are generally pursuant to either a direct contract with a customer or a subcontract with a general contractor to a customer (including government agencies). Each contract, including contracts with government agencies, includes various terms and conditions that impose certain requirements on IS&S, including the ability of the government agency or general contractor to alter the price, quantity or delivery schedule of the products. Additionally, each government agency or general contractor retains the right to terminate the contract at any time at its convenience. Upon alteration or termination of these contracts, IS&S is entitled typically to an equitable adjustment to the contract price so that it would be compensated for delivered items and allowable costs incurred. Accordingly, because these contracts can be terminated, the Company cannot be assured that its backlog will result in sales. For example, in October 2014, Delta issued a cancellation notice to the Company purporting to terminate its contract with IS&S resulting in $61.9 million of debookings with respect thereto.\nThe Company enters into fixed-price contracts or service arrangements to perform specified design and EDC services related to its products that could subject IS&S to losses in the event the Company incurs cost overruns on its projects.\nDuring fiscal 2015, approximately 27% percent of the Company\u2019s total sales were from fixed-price EDC arrangements with customers to perform specified design and EDC services related to its products. These arrangements allow IS&S to benefit by recovering some of its product development costs, but it carries the risk of potential cost overruns. If the Company\u2019s initial cost estimates are incorrect, it can incur potentially large one time charges and losses on these contracts. These EDC arrangements can expose the Company to potential losses because the customer may compel IS&S to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the incremental cost of its replacement by another provider. Because some of these projects involve new technologies and applications, and can last for more than a year, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with subcontractors, and cost overruns can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to IS&S over time. Furthermore, if the Company does not meet project deadlines or if its products do not meet customer specifications, it may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages, or suffer losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. The Company\u2019s results of operations are dependent on its ability to maximize earnings from the EDC service arrangements. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nReductions in government expenditures could adversely affect IS&S business.\nThe Budget Act of 2011 triggered substantial, automatic reductions in both defense and discretionary spending. The automatic across-the-board sequestration cuts are in addition to reductions already reflected in the defense funding over a ten-year period and could have significant consequences to the Company\u2019s business and industry. While the full impact of sequestration is undetermined, the impact of any resulting reductions in defense appropriations, and/or reductions in U.S. defense spending could result in delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and negatively affect the IS&S\u2019s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs, which could adversely affect IS&S.\nBank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. For example, during the economic downturn of 2009 and 2010, the global uncertainty and continued concern regarding credit availability, including failures of financial institutions, produced unprecedented government intervention in the U.S., Europe and other regions of the world. During these periods of volatility and\ndisruption, risks to IS&S include:\n\u00b7 declines in revenues and profitability from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic\n\u00b7 problems of customers;\n\u00b7 reprioritization of government spending away from defense programs in which IS&S participates;\n\u00b7 reduced access to credit sources; and\n\u00b7 disruptions in supplies associated with any financial constraints faced by vendors.\nA portion of IS&S sales come from government contracts, which could be adversely affected by continued high U.S. federal budget deficits.\nA portion of IS&S sales has been, and is expected to continue to be, from defense contractors or government agencies in connection with government aircraft retrofit or original equipment manufacturing contracts. Sales to government contractors and government agencies could decline as a result of DoD spending cuts and general budgetary constraints which may become more severe as the federal budget deficit remains high.\nIS&S depends on key personnel to manage its business effectively, and an inability to retain its key employees could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to compete.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the efforts, abilities, and expertise of its senior management and other key personnel. There can be no assurance IS&S will be able to retain such employees, and the loss of some could damage its ability to execute its business strategy. The Company intends to continue hiring key management, engineering, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and IS&S may not be able to attract or retain additional qualified personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to implement and improve its operational, administrative and financial systems and controls and to manage, train and expand its employee base. IS&S cannot provide assurance that, after giving effect to its cost containment initiatives, that current and planned personnel levels, systems, procedures, and controls will be adequate to support the current and future customer base. In such a circumstance, the Company may not be able to exploit existing and potential market opportunities. Any delays or difficulties encountered could impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract new customers or maintain its relationships with existing customers.\nIS&S relies on third party suppliers for components of its products, and any interruption in the supply of these components could hinder its ability to deliver products on a timely basis.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing process consists primarily of assembling components purchased from its supply chain. The suppliers may not continue to be available to IS&S. If the Company is unable to maintain relationships with key third party suppliers, the development and distribution of its products could be delayed until equivalent components can be obtained and integrated into the products. In addition, substitution of certain components from other manufacturers may require product redesign, FAA or other approval, which could delay the Company\u2019s ability to ship products.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and, as a result, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires, among other things, that the Company maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company\u2019s compliance with Section 404 requires that it compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform an appropriate evaluation. During the evaluation and testing process, if the Company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, it will be unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If the Company is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm determines the Company has a material weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its reviews, the Company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, the market price of its common stock could decline, and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict the Company\u2019s future access to the capital markets.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully remediate the existing material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of its financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nIn connection with the audit of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company\u2019s management and independent registered public accounting firm identified control deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that constitute a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company\u2019s management and independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in its control over financial reporting attributable to a lack of effective controls to evaluate whether revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion accounting using the zero profit margin method was adequately designed and executed to support the accurate reporting of revenue and the related receivables. As such, the Company\u2019s controls over financial reporting were not designed or operating effectively, and as a result there were adjustments required in connection with closing the Company\u2019s books and records and preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2015. These control deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual and interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.\nIn an effort to remediate the Company\u2019s material weakness, it has taken and intends to take steps to improve its controls to ensure the accurate and timely reporting of revenue and the related receivables, including (i) implementing procedures to identify and evaluate customer contracts to utilize the zero profit method of accounting only if it meets all the relevant criteria in ASC 605-35, 605-35 \u201cRevenue Recognition, Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,\u201d (ii) strengthening quarterly review processes to ensure proper recognition of revenue and (iii) planning to utilize third-party accounting experts to assist the Company in the proper application of revenue recognition principles to percentage-of-completion customer contracts.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in pursuing these measures or that these measures will significantly improve or remediate the material weakness described above. There is also no assurance that the Company has identified all of its material weaknesses or that it will not in the future have additional material weaknesses. We have not yet remediated the material weakness noted above, and the remediation measures that the Company has implemented and intend to implement may be insufficient to address its existing material weakness or to prevent additional material weaknesses. If the Company fails to remediate the material weakness, it may be unable to accurately report its financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to remediate the material weakness in a timely manner, or at all, or that in the future, additional material weaknesses will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If the Company\u2019s efforts to remediate the material weakness identified are not successful, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur, the Company\u2019s ability to accurately and timely report its financial position could be impaired, which could result in late filings of the Company\u2019s annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, restatements of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price or suspension or delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from NASDAQ.\nThe Company\u2019s competition includes other manufacturers of air data systems and flight information displays against whom it may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Competitors include Honeywell, Rockwell Collins, Inc., Thales, Garmin, GEAS, and L-3 Communications. All these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than does IS&S. In addition, these competitors have much greater experience in and resources for marketing their products. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer preferences, or to devote greater resources to development, promotion and sale of their products than IS&S can. The Company\u2019s competitors may have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases. Such competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to protect its proprietary rights against potential risk of infringement. If IS&S is unable to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe Company\u2019s success and ability to compete will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for its technology and products, both in the United States and internationally. In addition, IS&S must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nIS&S currently holds 22 U.S. patents and has 8 U.S. patent applications pending. In addition, the Company holds 65 international patents and has 13 international patent applications pending. IS&S cannot be certain that patents will be issued on any of its present or future applications. In addition, existing patents or future patents may not adequately protect the Company\u2019s technology if they are not broad enough and are successfully challenged, or if other entities are able to develop competing methods without violating its patents. If IS&S is not successful in protecting its intellectual property, competitors could begin to offer products that incorporate the Company\u2019s technology. Patent protection involves complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, is highly uncertain. Litigation relating to intellectual property is often very time consuming and expensive. If a successful claim of patent infringement were made against IS&S, and if the Company were unable to develop non-infringing technology, or to license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, the Company might not be able to produce and sell some of its products. Further, IS&S has incurred, and may continue to incur, significant legal and other costs in defense of its intellectual property.\nA cyber security incident could have a negative impact.\nA cyber-attack that bypasses the Company\u2019s information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) security systems causing an IT security breach, may lead to a material disruption of its IT business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in an adverse business impact. Risks may include:\n\u00b7 negative impact on future results due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential data or intellectual property;\n\u00b7 operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of IT systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities; and\n\u00b7 negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers, partners or industry peers.\nTax changes could affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and future profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s future results could be affected negatively by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in the overall profitability and changes to statutory tax rates in the United States, changes in tax legislation, and the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns.\nIS&S may not be able to identify or complete acquisitions, or it may consummate an acquisition that adversely affects the Company\u2019s operating results.\nOne of the Company\u2019s strategies may be to acquire businesses or technologies that complement its existing operations. IS&S has limited experience in acquiring businesses or technologies. There can be no assurance IS&S will be able to acquire or profitably manage acquisitions or successfully integrate them into its operations. Furthermore, certain risks are inherent in pursuing acquisitions, such as the demands of management\u2019s time and attention and integrating disparate company cultures and facilities. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, particularly in quarters immediately following the consummation of such transactions, as the Company integrates operations of acquired businesses into its operations. Once integrated, acquisitions may not perform as expected or be accretive to the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nIf IS&S is unable to respond to rapid technological change, its products could become obsolete and its reputation could suffer.\nFuture generations of flat panel displays, air data systems, engine and fuel displays, and flight management systems which embody new technologies or new industry standards could render the Company\u2019s products obsolete. The market for aviation products is subject to rapid technological change, new product introductions, changes in customer preferences, and evolving industry standards and government regulations. The Company\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to:\n\u00b7 embrace rapidly changing technologies;\n\u00b7 adapt the Company\u2019s products to evolving industry standards and government regulations; and\n\u00b7 develop and introduce timely, high quality, cost effective new products, and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers.\nIf IS&S fails to modify or improve its products in response to evolving industry standards and government regulations, its products could rapidly become obsolete.\nThe Company\u2019s products are currently subject to direct regulation by the FAA and other equivalent organizations. The Company\u2019s products, as they relate to aircraft applications, must be approved by the FAA, EASA, or other equivalent organizations before they can be installed in an aircraft. To be certified, IS&S must demonstrate that its products are accurate and able to maintain certain levels of repeatability over time. Although certification requirements of the FAA and EASA are substantially similar, no formal reciprocity exists between the two regulators. Accordingly, even though the Company\u2019s products are FAA approved, it may need to obtain approval from EASA or other appropriate organizations to have them certified for installation outside the United States.\nSignificant delay in receiving certification for newly developed products or enhancements to the Company\u2019s products, or the loss of certification for its existing products, could result in lost sales or delays in sales. Furthermore, new regulations or product standards, and changes to existing product standards could require IS&S to change its products and underlying technology. IS&S cannot ensure that it will receive regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.\nInasmuch as the Company\u2019s products utilize sophisticated technology and are deployed in complex aircraft cockpit environments, problems with these products may arise that could harm the Company\u2019s reputation for quality assurance and, consequently, its business prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors, omissions, or defects, particularly when the Company incorporates new technologies into its products or when it releases new versions or enhancements of its existing products. Despite the Company\u2019s quality assurance process, errors, omissions or defects could occur in its current products, in new products, or in new versions or enhancements of existing products. IS&S may be required to redesign or recall those products or pay damages. Such an event could result in the following:\n\u00b7 delay or loss of revenues;\n\u00b7 cancellation of customer contracts;\n\u00b7 diversion of development resources;\n\u00b7 damage to the Company\u2019s reputation;\n\u00b7 increased service and warranty costs; or\n\u00b7 litigation costs.\nAlthough IS&S carries product liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses in the event of a large product liability claim. In addition, IS&S may not be able to maintain such insurance in the future.\nThe Company has limited experience in marketing and distributing its products internationally.\nIS&S plans to derive increasing revenues from sales outside the United States, particularly in Europe. Risks inherent in doing business internationally include:\n\u00b7 differing regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 legal uncertainty regarding liability;\n\u00b7 tariffs, trade barriers, and other regulatory barriers;\n\u00b7 political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7 the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States; and\n\u00b7 variances and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations.\nCurrently, all of the Company\u2019s international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. An increase in the dollar\u2019s value compared to other currencies could render its products less competitive in the international markets. In the future, IS&S may be required to conduct sales in the foreign country\u2019s local currency, thus exposing the Company to fluctuations and volatility in exchange rates that could adversely affect its operating results.", "PERMNO": 88534, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "ISSC"}
