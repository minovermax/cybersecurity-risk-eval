{"cik": "1113169", "company": "PRICE T ROWE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. There may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.\nOur revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control.\nWe derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors. Our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management. As a result, our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors, including:\n\u2022Investment Performance. If the investment performance of our managed investment portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable third-party benchmarks, we could lose existing and potential clients and suffer a decrease in assets under management.\n\u2022General Financial Market Declines. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from advisory fees on managed investment portfolios. A downturn in financial markets would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease, and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments, thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management.\n\u2022Investment Concentration. The allocation of investment products for assets under management within market segments or strategies may impact associated fees that can vary depending on product offerings.\n\u2022Investor Mobility. Our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time, without advance notice and with little to no significant penalty.\n\u2022Capacity Constraints. Prolonged periods of strong relative investment performance and/or strong investor inflows has resulted in and may result in capacity constraints within certain strategies, which can lead to, among other things, the closure of those strategies to new investors.\n\u2022Investing Trends. Changes in investing trends, particularly investor preference for passive or alternative investment products as well as increasing investor preference for environmentally and socially responsible investment products, and changes in retirement savings trends, may reduce interest in our products and may alter our mix of assets under management.\n\u2022Interest Rate Changes. Investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income and multi-asset investment portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates.\n\u2022Geo-Political Exposure. Our managed investment portfolios may have significant investments in markets that are subject to risk of loss from political or diplomatic developments, government policies, civil unrest, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and capital controls, and changes in legislation related to ownership limitations.\nA decrease in the value of assets under our management, or an adverse change in their composition, particularly in market segments where our assets are concentrated, could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues. For any period in which revenues decline, net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues.\nA majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the U.S. mutual funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.\nWe provide investment advisory, distribution, and other administrative services to the U.S. mutual funds under various agreements. Investment advisory services are provided to each T. Rowe Price mutual fund under individual investment management agreements. The Board of each T. Rowe Price mutual fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60-days' notice. If a T. Rowe Price mutual fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us, we would experience a decline in fees earned from the U.S. mutual funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry. Competitive pressures may result in a loss of clients and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients, thereby reducing our revenues and net income.\nWe are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions. Some of these financial institutions have greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets. Some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. We compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services. Some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. Substantially all of our investment products are available without sales or redemption fees, which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing products.\nThe market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive investment products. As a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us. While we believe there will always be demand for strong performing active management, we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain.\nAs part of our continued efforts to attract and retain clients, we develop and launch new products and services, which may require expenditure of resources and may expose us to new regulatory or compliance requirements as well as increased risk of operational or client service errors.\nIn the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures, which we have done selectively in the past, revenues and operating margins could be\nadversely impacted. Fee reductions may vary depending on strategy and product offerings, which could result in investment rebalancing or reallocation adversely impacting revenues and operating margins.\nOur operations are complex and a failure to properly execute operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues.\nWe provide global investment management and administrative services to our clients. In certain cases, we rely on third-party service providers for the execution and delivery of these services. There can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties. Failure to properly execute or oversee these services could have an adverse impact on our business, financial results and reputation, and subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, penalties, or litigation.\nNew investment strategies, investment vehicles, distribution channels, or other evolutions of or additions to our business may increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such changes. Significant business changes may require us to update our processes or technology and may increase risk to meeting our business objectives. In addition, our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level. If any of these factors were to arise it could disrupt our operations, increase our expenses or result in financial exposure, regulatory inquiry or reputational damage.\nOur business model is dependent on our personnel, as well as others involved in our business, such as third-party vendors, providers and other intermediaries, who support internal controls, supervision, technology and training to provide comfort that our activities do not violate applicable guidelines, rules and regulations or adversely affect our clients, counterparties or us, and all of which are subject to potential human errors. Our personnel and others involved in our business may make errors that are not always immediately detected, which may disrupt our operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or sanctions, litigation, or otherwise damage our reputation.\nThe quantitative models we use may contain errors, which could result in financial losses or adversely impact product performance and client relationships.\nWe use various quantitative models to support investment decisions and investment processes, including those related to portfolio management and portfolio risk analysis, as well as those related to client investment or savings advice or guidance. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on our business and reputation.\nAny damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income or access to capital.\nWe have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance, and superior client service. Our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or even impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation, even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed. Actual or perceived failure to adequately address the environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") expectations of our various stakeholders could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of client assets or harm our access to capital. Furthermore, ESG issues have been the subject of increased focus by regulators and any inability to meet applicable requirements or expectations may adversely impact our reputation. Misconduct by our employees or third-party service providers could likewise adversely impact our reputation and lead to a loss of client assets. While we maintain policies, procedures, and controls to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized activities, we are subject to the risk that our associates or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures. Real or perceived conflicts between our clients\u2019 interests and our own, as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information, may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action. Any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel, and reduce the amount of assets under our management, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.\nOur expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income.\nOur operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly for many reasons, including:\n\u2022expenses incurred in connection with our multi-year strategic plan to strengthen our long-term competitive position;\n\u2022variations in the level of total compensation expense due to changes in, among other things, bonuses, stock-based awards, employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes, our employee count and mix, competitive factors, market performance, and inflation;\n\u2022changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses, including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the U.S. and further penetrating U.S. distribution channels;\n\u2022expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development;\n\u2022changes in the costs incurred for third-party vendors that perform certain administrative and operating services;\n\u2022changes in expenses that are correlated to our assets under management, such as distribution and servicing fees;\n\u2022a future impairment of investments that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;\n\u2022a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;\n\u2022unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad;\n\u2022unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill;\n\u2022future changes to legal and regulatory requirements and potential litigation; and\n\u2022disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, and mutual fund transfer agent, investment management, trading, and accounting systems.\nUnder our agreements with the U.S. mutual funds, we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms. If we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds, our operating results will be adversely affected. While we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any T. Rowe Price investment products, any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income.\nOur hedging strategies utilized to mitigate risk may not be effective, which could impact our earnings.\nWe employ hedging strategies related to our supplemental savings plan in order to hedge the liability related thereto. In the event that our hedging strategies are not effective, the resulting impact may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAmendments to tax laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the Company.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject, and these regulations could have a material impact on our tax liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts.\nAdditionally, changes in the status of tax deferred investment options, including retirement plans, tax-free municipal bonds, the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates, and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment products less favorably and reduce investor demand for products and services we offer, which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues.\nExaminations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nBased on the global nature of our business, from time to time we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes (and, in certain cases, interest, fines, or penalties). We have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, however, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates.\nWe have contracted with third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our investment products and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future.\nThese contracted third-party intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to, and in competition with, our investment products, and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our products. It would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships. In addition, some investors rely on third-party financial planners, registered investment advisers, and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of an investment adviser and investment products. These professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment product as better meeting their particular clients' needs. We cannot assure that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future. Further, their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients' assets under our management. Mergers, acquisitions, and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third-party intermediaries. As a result of these changes, more of our revenues may be concentrated with fewer intermediaries, which may impact our dependence on these intermediaries. The presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income, possibly by material amounts.\nNatural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.\nArmed conflicts, trade wars, tariffs or sanctions, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, power failures, epidemics or pandemics, climate change, increased severity of weather events, or natural disasters and other events outside of our control could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, and net income by:\n\u2022decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that we manage,\n\u2022causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive,\n\u2022incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our employees,\n\u2022interrupting our business operations or those of critical service providers,\n\u2022triggering technology delays or failures, and\n\u2022requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage, replace our facilities, and restore our operations.\nA significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the Baltimore, Maryland region; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and in London, England. In addition, we maintain offices with associates in many other global locations, including Sydney, Australia; Hong Kong; Singapore; Tokyo, Japan; and Luxembourg. We have developed various backup systems and contingency plans, but we cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. We also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If we lose the availability of any associates, or, if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely resume our business operations, which could lead to financial losses, a tarnished reputation and loss of clients that could result in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenues, and materially reduced net income.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operation may be adversely affected by the coronavirus or other global pandemics.\nSince early 2020, global financial markets have been monitoring and reacting to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The spread of the coronavirus has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption to the global economy and may further impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The coronavirus pandemic has adversely affected global financial markets and impacted global supply chains. Health concerns and uncertainty regarding continued coronavirus impacts could lead to further and/or increased volatility in global capital and credit markets, adversely affect our key executives and other personnel, clients, investors, providers, suppliers, lessees, and other third parties, and negatively impact our assets under management (\"AUM\"), revenues, income, business and operations. Since our revenue is based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management, the ultimate impact on global financial markets and our clients\u2019 decisions related to this event could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nFurthermore, while we have in place robust and well-established business continuity plans that address the potential impact to our associates and our facilities, and a comprehensive suite of technologies which enable our associates to work remotely and conduct business, and to date while we have been successful in navigating these challenges, no assurance can be given that the steps we have taken will continue to be effective or appropriate. Additionally, we must effectively ensure a safe working environment for associates working onsite in our offices, and adequately manage the post-pandemic transition from remote to onsite or a hybrid working environment. In the event that our associates become incapacitated by the coronavirus, our business operations may be impacted, which could lead to reputational and financial harm.\nOur investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio.\nSeparately from the investments we manage for our clients, we currently have a substantial investment portfolio. All of these investments are subject to investment market risk, and our non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant impairments or unrealized losses on these investments. In addition, related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments, including the impact of market conditions and interest rates, and the size of our corporate money market and longer-term mutual fund holdings. Fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future.\nWe may review and pursue strategic transactions in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position and these could pose risks.\nFrom time to time, we consider strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, dispositions, consolidations, organizational restructurings, joint ventures or similar transactions, any of which may impact our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully complete such transactions, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. These initiatives typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges to our ongoing business operations. In addition, acquisitions and related transactions involve risks, including unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping, additional or new regulatory requirements, operating facilities and technologies, and new employees; adverse effects on our earnings in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction.\nWe own a 23% investment in UTI Asset Management Company Ltd (\"UTI\"), an Indian asset management company, and we may consider non-controlling minority investments in other entities in the future. We may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future.\nOn December 29, 2021, we completed our acquisition of OHA. Important ongoing integration-related risks, including that the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be fully realized, or may take longer to realize than expected, or that the integration may cost more or take longer than expected, could adversely impact our operating results. The ongoing integration of OHA is a time-consuming process that could distract our management and disrupt our business. A significant portion of OHA's revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory agreements and carried interest from general partner interests in affiliated private investment funds. Generally, OHA is entitled to a performance fee and carried interest under these agreements only in cases where the related\nportfolio investment return exceeds agreed-upon relative or absolute investment return thresholds, and there can be no assurance that these thresholds will be met.\nWe are exposed to risks arising from our international operations.\nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks:\n\u2022difficulty in managing, operating, and marketing our international operations;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management, revenues, expenses, and assets in our U.S. dollar based financial statements; and\n\u2022significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RISKS.\nOur success depends on our key personnel and our investment performance and financial results could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.\nOur success depends on our highly skilled personnel, including our portfolio managers, investment analysts, sales and client relationship personnel, and corporate officers, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. Strong financial services professionals are in demand, and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees. Generally, our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time. We cannot assure that we will be able to attract or retain key personnel.\nDue to the global nature of our investment advisory business, our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest, organized crime or terrorism, and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions. We have near- and long-term succession planning processes, including programs to develop our future leaders, which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent. However, in order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. The loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors. Losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income, possibly materially.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS.\nCompliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and non-compliance could result in fines and penalties.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of our employees, fines, penalties, sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets, or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business. A regulatory proceeding, even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions, could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital. Any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income, and potentially result in complex litigation.\nLegal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden, impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and cause a loss of, or impact the servicing of, our clients and fund shareholders.\nOur regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. New regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations; regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt. Future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and\nprofitability. Additionally, some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets, service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients.\nPotential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022As part of the debate in Washington, D.C. and in state legislatures, there has been increasing focus on the framework of the U.S. retirement system. We could experience adverse business impacts if legislative and regulatory changes limit retirement plans to certain products and services, or favor certain investment vehicles, that we do not offer, materially limit retirement savings opportunities or foster substantial outflows from retirement savings plans for non-retirement purposes.\n\u2022There has been substantial regulatory and legislative activity at federal and state levels regarding standards of care for financial services firms, related to both retirement and taxable accounts and the United States Department of Labor intends to propose new fiduciary rules applicable to retirement plans and accounts that comprise a majority of our accounts. Actions taken by applicable regulatory or legislative bodies may impact our business activities and increase our costs.\n\u2022The Federal Reserve Board has adopted final regulations related to non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institutions (\"SIFIs\"), and other jurisdictions are contemplating similar regulation. At this time, US regulators have not designated mutual funds or traditional asset managers as non-bank SIFIs. However, if any T. Rowe Price fund or T. Rowe Price affiliate was deemed a SIFI, increased regulatory oversight would apply to our business, which may include enhanced capital, liquidity, leverage, stress testing, resolution planning, and risk management requirements.\n\u2022The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") regulation may limit the ability of certain T. Rowe Price investment products to use futures, swaps, and other derivatives. We have registered certain subsidiaries with the CFTC, subjecting us to additional regulatory requirements and costs, but also providing us additional flexibility to utilize such products. Nonetheless, there are still certain limitations on our investment products due to CFTC rules.\n\u2022There has been increased global regulatory focus on the manner in which intermediaries are paid for distribution of mutual funds. Changes to long-standing market practices related to fees or enhanced disclosure requirements may negatively impact sales of mutual funds by intermediaries, especially if such requirements are not applied to other investment products.\n\u2022We remain subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection of data we maintain concerning our clients and employees. These requirements continue to evolve, most commonly in ways that increase the complexity and costs of compliance. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \"CCPA\") effective in January 1, 2020, which, among other things, significantly increased compliance obligations and the potential penalties for non-compliance, and California voters in November 2020 approved a replacement of this law effective January 1, 2023 with a new law that expands various requirements.\n\u2022After the 2008 financial crisis, global regulations on over-the-counter derivatives spearheaded by The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the United States and European Market Infrastructure Regulation in the European Union (\"EU\") have imposed clearing, margin, trade reporting, electronic trading and recordkeeping requirements on market participants. Alongside their general stabilizing and risk-reducing effect on the markets, these requirements have introduced operational complexity and additional costs to derivatives portfolios.\n\u2022The revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (\"MiFID II Directive\") and Regulation (\"MiFIR\") (together \u201cMiFID II\u201d) applied across the EU and member states of the European Economic Area beginning on January 3, 2018. Implementation of MiFID II has significantly impacted both the structure and operation of EU financial markets. Some of the main changes introduced under MiFID II include applying enhanced disclosure requirements, enhancing conduct of business and governance requirements, broadening the scope of pre and post trade transparency, increasing transaction reporting requirements, transforming the relationship between client commissions and research, and further regulation of trading venues. Compliance with MiFID II has increased operational complexity and increased our costs. For example, we began to pay for third-party\ninvestment research used by our UK-based investment manager, T. Rowe Price International Ltd, in 2018, and we now pay for all the research needs of our investment professionals globally.\n\u2022New laws or regulations involving ESG integration and disclosure may materially impact the asset management industry. For example, the EU\u2019s recent action plan on financing sustainable growth includes initiatives to integrate ESG into the financial system. Furthermore, the SEC and other regulators in the U.S. have announced plans to pursue similar initiatives, including additional disclosure obligations that would apply to our business operations, our employee and board diversity and other ESG-related matters.\nWe cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals. However, any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations. They may also result in changes to our product or service offerings. The changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and, to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees, it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer.\nWe may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance.\nWe are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties and costs. From time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. There also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including client claims, class action suits, and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. We cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nNet capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal, state, and foreign authorities. Each of our subsidiaries\u2019 net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements; however, a significant change in the required net capital, an operating loss, or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them.\nUnited Kingdom exit from European Union.\nWe have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) to support our global investment management business. We have realigned our European Union (\"EU\") and UK operations in response to the UK exit (\u201cBrexit\u201d) from the EU; however, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of Brexit on our operations or our business. We remain committed to our clients, associates and business expansion across the region.\nTECHNOLOGY RISKS.\nWe require significant quantities and types of technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete.\nWe depend on significant quantities of technology and, in many cases, highly specialized or proprietary or third-party licensed technology to support our business functions, including among others:\n\u2022securities analysis,\n\u2022securities trading,\n\u2022portfolio management,\n\u2022client service,\n\u2022accounting and internal financial reporting processes and controls,\n\u2022data security and integrity, and\n\u2022regulatory compliance and reporting.\nAll of our technology systems, including those provided by vendors, are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks, natural disasters, power failures, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, coding errors and other causes. A suspension or termination of vendor-provided software licenses or related support, upgrades, and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. Although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans, if our technology systems, including those provided by vendors, were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of clients and could harm our reputation. A technological breakdown or disruption in services from a vendor could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our clients.\nIn addition, our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many systems and/or countries, and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry, and regulatory demands. We might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure. If we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion, we might lose clients and fail to maintain regulatory compliance, which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation.\nA cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses.\nWe are dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities we maintain to protect our systems and data. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyberattack, a phishing scam, virus, ransomware attack, denial-of-service attack, or an attack launched from within the Company could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of confidential client or competitive information. In addition, our third-party vendors and other intermediaries with which we conduct business and transmit data could be subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event, and we cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those third parties or to allow them to continue their business operations, including their services to us, in a timely manner.\nThere have been increasing numbers of publicized cybersecurity incidents in recent years impacting other financial services firms as well as firms in other industries. Our use of third-party vendors and cloud technologies could heighten this risk. Should the technology operations on which we rely be compromised, we may have to make significant investments to upgrade, repair or replace our technology infrastructure or third-party vendors and may not be able to make such investments on a timely basis. Although we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable, prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business, it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from breaches of security, cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions from such events.\nWe could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard and maintain confidential information.\nAs part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients, associates and other parties, as well as, proprietary information relating to our business operations. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that both inadvertent errors and fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data, is either prevented or detected in a timely manner. We also leverage cloud-based solutions for the transmission and storage of this information.
