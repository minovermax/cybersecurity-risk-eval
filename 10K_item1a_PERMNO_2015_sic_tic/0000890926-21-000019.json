Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted us, and its ultimate impact on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created periods of significant economic disruption, high unemployment, volatility and disruption in financial markets, and required adjustments in the housing finance system and real estate markets. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in most states and communities in the United States. As a result, the demand for certain of our products and services has been impacted, and this impact may continue for an unknown period and could expand. Our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, remote technology interruptions, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions related to the pandemic. To date, in response to the pandemic, among other things, we have raised additional capital, aligned our business with the temporary origination and servicing guidelines announced by the GSEs, and activated our business continuity program by transitioning to a work-from-home virtual workforce model with certain essential activities supported by limited staff in office environments that comply with CDC guidelines and applicable state and local requirements.\nWe expect that the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to reduce its spread will continue to impact our business, subjecting us to the following risks:\n\u25a0As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, including the significant increase in unemployment, we have experienced a material increase in new defaults, including as a result of mortgage forbearance programs.\n\u25a0The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on new and existing mortgage defaults as well as the amount of capital we are required to hold against COVID-19 related defaults under the PMIERs, could potentially exhaust Radian Guaranty\u2019s excess, or \u201ccushion,\u201d of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets, in which case we may be required to contribute capital to Radian Guaranty to remain in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements. The amount that Radian Group could be required to contribute to Radian Guaranty to support PMIERs compliance is uncertain, but could be significant and, under extreme economic scenarios, exhaust Radian Group\u2019s available liquidity. See \u201c-The credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages,\u201d \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity\u201d and \u201c-Radian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\u201d\n\u25a0The pandemic has placed additional significant strain on the operations and financial condition of mortgage servicers, which could result in the disruption of the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies or result in servicers failing to appropriately report the status of loans, including whether the loans are subject to a COVID-19-related forbearance program. We could receive less mortgage insurance premiums as a result of loans going into default. See \u201c-Our business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\u201d\n\u25a0The assumptions upon which we base our premium rates may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, especially in a period of high market volatility and economic uncertainty such as we have experienced as a result of the pandemic. We have experienced a material increase in new defaults as a result of the pandemic and we may continue to experience a high volume of new defaults associated with the pandemic in future periods. Future new defaults are not currently reflected in our mortgage insurance loss reserves because we generally are not permitted to establish reserves in anticipation of such defaults. As a result of the material increase in new defaults that we have experienced, our loss reserves increased significantly in 2020. Our loss reserves may again increase significantly in future periods as a result of new defaults stemming from the pandemic, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201c-Our success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks. We expect to incur losses for future defaults beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements.\u201d\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u25a0The GSEs\u2019 business practices have changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the primary objectives of supporting borrowers impacted by the pandemic and protecting the ongoing functioning of the housing finance system. As the situation continues to evolve, the actions of the FHFA and GSEs in response to COVID-19 are likely to continue to significantly impact the housing finance system. Because traditional mortgage insurance is an important component of this system, these actions have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our mortgage insurance operations and performance. See \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses.\u201d\n\u25a0The number of home purchases or mortgage refinancings may be materially affected by the impact of the pandemic on general economic conditions, including unemployment, and on the availability of credit for mortgage loans. In addition, public and private sector initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of restrictions on business activities, and various policy initiatives to keep people in their homes during the pandemic through foreclosure and eviction moratoriums may affect the number of new mortgages available for us to insure and the demand for certain of the products and services in our Real Estate business. See \u201c-A decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business and conduct our Real Estate business.\u201d\n\u25a0As a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, we anticipate that defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured, could remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time, potentially resulting in higher levels of claims and Claim Severity for those loans that ultimately result in a claim. See \u201c-An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\u201d\n\u25a0The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and economic uncertainty such as we have experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the ultimate cure rate for loan defaults resulting from the pandemic may be lower than we have previously experienced in the context of other FEMA declared emergencies and lower than our expectations. See \u201c-If the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\u201d\n\u25a0The rating agencies continually review the financial strength ratings assigned to Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries, and the ratings are subject to change. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our financial results and condition, could cause one or more of the rating agencies to downgrade the ratings assigned to Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries. See \u201c-The current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position and potential downgrades by rating agencies to these ratings and the ratings assigned to Radian Group could adversely affect the Company\u201d\n\u25a0The markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The value of our fixed income securities has been volatile, which increases the risk that we will not achieve our investment objectives. If, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we underestimate our liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations. See \u201c-Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.\u201d\nAlthough we are uncertain of the ultimate magnitude or duration of the business and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, their long-term effect on our businesses will depend on, among other things: the extent and duration of the pandemic; the severity of and the number of people infected with the virus and the widespread availability of anti-viral treatments and vaccines, especially as new strains of COVID-19 have been discovered; the wider economic effects of the pandemic and the scope and duration of governmental and other third-party measures restricting day-to-day life and business operations; the impact of economic stimulus efforts to support the economy through the pandemic; and governmental and GSE programs implemented to assist borrowers experiencing a COVID-19-related hardship, including forbearance programs and suspensions of foreclosures and evictions. Due to the unprecedented and continually evolving social and economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and global economies generally, and in particular on the U.S. housing, real estate and housing finance markets, there is significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact on our business, business prospects, operating results and financial condition and our estimates or predictions regarding such impact may be materially wrong.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nRadian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity.\nIn order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer\u2019s financial condition. In addition, the PMIERs contain requirements related to the operations of our mortgage insurance business, including extensive operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. These extensive operational requirements have resulted in additional expenses and have required substantial time and effort from management\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nand our employees, which we expect will continue. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, including the financial requirements discussed below, the GSEs could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty.\nThe PMIERs include financial requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that requires a mortgage insurer\u2019s Available Assets to meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. The PMIERs financial requirements include increased financial requirements for defaulted loans, as well as for performing loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO credit scores. Radian Guaranty\u2019s ability to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements could be impacted by, among other factors: (i) the volume and product mix of our NIW; (ii) factors affecting the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, including the level of new defaults and prepayments; (iii) for existing defaults, the aging of these existing defaults and whether they are subject to, and remain in, forbearance programs, and the ultimate losses we incur on new or existing defaults; (iv) the application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge (as discussed below) under the PMIERs; (v) the amount of credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for our third-party reinsurance transactions (which is subject to initial and ongoing review by the GSEs); and (vi) potential amendments or updates to the PMIERs. If our mix of business includes more loans that are subject to the increased financial requirements under the PMIERs, we may limit the type and volume of business we are willing to write for certain of our products based on the increased financial requirements associated with certain loans. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our future revenues.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created periods of significant economic disruption, high unemployment, volatility and disruption in financial markets, and required adjustments in the housing finance system and real estate markets. As a result, we have experienced a material increase in new defaults, substantially all related to defaults of loans subject to forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall volume of new defaults resulting from the pandemic has resulted in an increase in Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets and has negatively impacted Radian Guaranty\u2019s PMIERs Cushion. We may continue to experience a high level of defaults as a result of the pandemic for the foreseeable future, which defaults would continue to negatively impact Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets and our results of operations. The amount of Minimum Required Assets that Radian Guaranty is and will be required to maintain, will depend on the number, timing and duration of defaults, including those defaulted loans participating in forbearance programs. This, in turn, will depend on the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, its resulting impact on the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and the ability of current and any future government programs to provide economic and individual relief, all of which will likely have an impact on the ability of borrowers to remain current on their mortgage payments and, if they have entered into forbearance or other relief programs, to resume making payments upon the expiration of the forbearance period. Based on the date each loan in our delinquent inventory was reported to us as being in forbearance, we estimate that during the first half of 2021, a significant majority of those loans in forbearance will have been in forbearance for 12 months, and unless extended, their forbearance plans may terminate. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-CARES Act\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-GSE Requirements\u201d for information regarding forbearance programs for borrowers experiencing financial hardship related to the pandemic.\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-GSE Requirements,\u201d the PMIERs apply a 0.30 multiplier to the Minimum Required Asset factor for loans that have become non-performing as a result of a \u201cFEMA Declared Major Disaster\u201d event, including as a result of participation in a forbearance program. This effectively reduces the Minimum Required Asset amount for these loans by 70%. Under National Emergency Guidelines issued by the GSEs, the PMIERs were temporarily amended so that the Disaster Related Capital Charge is currently being applied nationwide to certain non-performing loans that we refer to as COVID-19 Defaulted Loans, which comprise non-performing loans that either: (i) have an Initial Missed Payment (discussed below) occurring during the COVID-19 Crisis Period or (ii) are subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19 (which is assumed under the COVID-19 Amendment to be the case for any loan that has an Initial Missed Payment occurring during the COVID-19 Crisis Period and is subject to a forbearance plan), the terms of which are materially consistent with the terms of forbearance plans offered by the GSEs. The National Emergency Guidelines state that they will be updated if the GSEs determine that the COVID-19 Crisis Period needs to be extended. In December 2020, the GSEs extended the COVID-19 Crisis Period through March 31, 2021 and it is uncertain whether the COVID-19 Crisis Period will be further extended in the future. If the COVID-19 Crisis Period is not extended, then pursuant to the COVID-19 Amendment, the Disaster Related Capital Charge would continue to apply nationwide to defaults subject to a COVID-19 related forbearance plan for as long as the GSEs choose to leave the National Emergency Guidelines in place.\nThe current broad-based application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge has materially reduced the total amount of Minimum Required Assets that Radian Guaranty otherwise would have been required to hold against COVID-19 Defaulted Loans. Primarily as a consequence of the Disaster Related Capital Charge, Radian Guaranty maintained a significant PMIERs Cushion as of December 31, 2020. While we expect that application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge will continue to materially reduce Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets for COVID-19 Defaulted Loans, the benefit that Radian Guaranty currently is receiving from the Disaster Related Capital Charge is expected to diminish over time. The reduction of this benefit could be accelerated if the GSEs were to terminate the temporary COVID-19 Amendment to the PMIERs issued under their National Emergency Guidelines. See, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Mortgage\u201d for more information on the declining benefit of the Disaster Related Capital Charge received over time.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAs the benefits of the Disaster Related Capital Charge diminish, or if existing and future new defaults continue to materially increase Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets, we may be required or otherwise choose to: (i) contribute capital to Radian Guaranty; (ii) alter our strategy with respect to our NIW; or (iii) seek additional capital relief through reinsurance or otherwise, which may not be available on acceptable terms or on terms that would be approved by the GSEs.\nThe GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time and also have broad discretion to interpret the PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of Radian Guaranty\u2019s Available Assets and/or Minimum Required Assets. The most recent large-scale revisions to PMIERs, or PMIERs 2.0, became effective on March 31, 2019 and the PMIERs were further updated as part of the temporary COVID-19 Amendment to the PMIERs under the National Emergency Guidelines. We expect the GSEs to continue to update the PMIERs in the future, including potentially to align the PMIERs 2.0 financial requirements with the increased capital requirements for the GSEs under the ERCF that was finalized in December 2020 and/or the proposed new liquidity requirements for the GSEs. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-GSE Requirements\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for additional information on the ERCF and proposed GSE liquidity requirements.\nCompliance with the PMIERs financial requirements could impact our holding company liquidity if additional capital support for Radian Guaranty is required for it to maintain this compliance. The amount of capital that Radian Group could be required to contribute to Radian Guaranty for this purpose is uncertain, but could be significant and, under extreme economic scenarios, could exhaust Radian Group\u2019s available liquidity. See \u201c-Radian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\u201d Further, if Radian Guaranty becomes capital constrained, it may be more difficult for Radian Guaranty to return capital to Radian Group, which would compound the negative liquidity impact to Radian Group of the contributions it may be required to make to Radian Guaranty and leave less liquidity to satisfy Radian Group\u2019s other obligations. Depending on the amount of liquidity that is utilized from Radian Group, we may be required (or may decide) to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe PMIERs prohibit Radian Guaranty from engaging in certain activities such as insuring loans originated or serviced by an affiliate (except under certain circumstances) and require Radian Guaranty to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking many actions, which may include, among other things, entering into certain intercompany agreements, settling loss mitigation disputes with customers and commuting risk. Further, pursuant to the National Emergency Guidelines, through June 30, 2021, the consent of the GSEs is required for Radian Guaranty to: (i) pay dividends or make payments of principal or increase payments of interest beyond those commitments made prior to June 30, 2020 associated with the Surplus Notes; (ii) make any other payments, unless related to expenses incurred in the normal course of business or to commitments made prior to June 30, 2020; (iii) pledge or transfer asset(s) to any affiliate or investor; or (iv) enter into any new arrangements or alter any existing arrangements under tax-sharing and intercompany expense-sharing agreements other than renewals and extensions of agreements in effect prior to June 30, 2020. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or to Radian Group.\nAlthough we expect Radian Guaranty to retain its eligibility status with the GSEs and to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements, including as potentially updated in the future, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. Loss of Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility status with the GSEs would have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our Mortgage business and our future prospects, as well as a material negative impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance regulators in the states where they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of our investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company\u2019s ability to write new business. Among other matters, the state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries.\nState insurance capital requirements for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries include Risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that may limit the amount of insurance that our mortgage insurance subsidiaries write or the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to distribute capital to Radian Group. Similarly, our title insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory premium reserves that vary by state and are subject to periodic reviews of certain financial performance ratios, and the results of those ratios could result in additional capital requirements in states where it is licensed. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-State Regulation\u201d for more information on these requirements. Among other things, our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital in our mortgage insurance and title insurance subsidiaries could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage lending customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty if it is not in compliance with applicable state insurance requirements. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business likely would be significantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nwrite in one or more states. For additional information about statutory surplus and other state insurance requirements, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Mortgage\u201d, as well as Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRadian Group also may be required to provide capital support for Radian Guaranty and its affiliated insurers if additional capital is required by those subsidiaries pursuant to future changes to insurance laws and regulations. The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. In December 2019, a working group of state regulators released exposure drafts of a revised Model Act, including new proposed mortgage guaranty insurance capital requirements for mortgage insurers. While the process for developing this framework was inactive as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we understand the initiative remains active and that an effort to resume work on the exposure draft is expected in 2021. As proposed, the capital requirements set forth in the current exposure draft are impacted by, among other things, changes in the economic and housing environment, including changes in home prices and incomes. The ultimate outcome of this process remains uncertain, including if and when the process may be completed, the potential form of any new capital requirements, and how they may be implemented and enforced.\nThe mortgage insurance industry has always been highly competitive with respect to pricing. Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries\u2019 premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage fair competition in the insurance marketplace. We may be subject to regulatory inquiries or examinations with respect to our mortgage insurance premium rates and policy forms. Similarly, our title insurance business is subject to extensive rate regulation by the applicable state agencies in the states in which it operates. Given that the premium rates for our insurance subsidiaries are highly regulated, we could lose business opportunities and fail to successfully implement our business strategies if our rates are deemed non-compliant or are subject to investigation, if new rates and policy forms are not approved as may be required, or if we are otherwise unable to respond to competitor pricing actions and our customers\u2019 demands in a timely and compliant manner.\nChanges in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses.\nOur current business model is highly dependent on the GSEs as the GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance policies. Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, could negatively impact our businesses and financial performance. Examples of potential changes that could impact our business, may include, without limitation:\n\u25a0eligibility requirements for a mortgage insurer to become and remain an approved eligible insurer for the GSEs;\n\u25a0underwriting standards on mortgages they purchase, including as a result of the FHFA\u2019s more recent focus on reducing the GSEs\u2019 risk profile with respect to loans with multiple higher risk characteristics;\n\u25a0policies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire;\n\u25a0the national conforming loan limit for mortgages they acquire;\n\u25a0the level of mortgage insurance required;\n\u25a0the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;\n\u25a0the terms required to be included in master policies for the mortgage insurance policies they acquire, including limitations on our ability to mitigate losses on insured mortgages that are in default;\n\u25a0the amount of loan level price adjustments or guarantee fees, which often result in a higher cost to borrowers, that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u25a0the degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender\u2019s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.\nIn addition, as discussed above under \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity,\u201d the GSEs\u2019 business practices have changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the primary objectives of supporting borrowers impacted by the pandemic and protecting the ongoing functioning of the housing finance system. The significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on housing markets and the housing finance system is wide-ranging and unprecedented in scope. As the situation continues to evolve, the actions or potential inactions of the FHFA and GSEs in response to COVID-19 are likely to continue to have a significant impact on the overall functioning of the housing finance system. Because traditional mortgage insurance is an important component of this system and because our businesses depend on the health of the housing finance system and housing markets in particular, these actions have impacted, and may continue to impact our business operations and performance.\nThe future structure of the residential housing finance system remains uncertain, including whether comprehensive housing reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what form it may ultimately take. Since the FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including proposals\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nfor GSE reform ranging from nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs to a system that combines a federal role with private capital. In conjunction with these proposals, there has been ongoing debate about the roles that the federal government and private capital should play in the housing finance system. To the extent new legislative action alters the existing GSE charters without explicit preservation of the role of private mortgage insurance for high-LTV loans, our business could be adversely affected. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for a discussion of the future of housing finance in the U.S., including objectives for future reform.\nUnder its current Trump-appointed leadership, the FHFA has been focused on recapitalizing the GSEs in preparation for releasing them from conservatorship. In December 2020, the FHFA finalized the ERCF, establishing new increased capital requirements for the GSEs, and the FHFA also has proposed new liquidity requirements for the GSEs that remain subject to public comment. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for further information about the specific requirements established by the ERCF and the proposed new liquidity requirements. Taken together, compliance with the increased capital requirements imposed by the ERCF and the proposed new GSE liquidity requirements could significantly alter the business practices and operations of the GSEs, including potentially increasing GSE pricing and decreasing the GSEs\u2019 use of credit risk transfer. An increase in GSE pricing could make alternatives to the GSEs such as FHA insured loans or the private securitization market more attractive, which could reduce the GSEs\u2019 market position and reduce the number of loans available for private mortgage insurance. Further, the GSEs may seek to amend the PMIERs financial requirements in the future to align with the ERCF and the GSE liquidity requirements, once finalized. It remains uncertain if, when and how the PMIERs ultimately may be aligned with the ERCF, however, the changes could include: (i) an increase in the level of Radian Guaranty\u2019s required capital and (ii) a decrease in the amount of PMIERs\u2019 capital relief that Radian Guaranty receives for existing or future reinsurance or insurance-linked notes transactions.\nThere are many considerations related to financial, underwriting, risk management, counterparty and operational areas that likely would need to be addressed by the GSEs in order to come into compliance with the ERCF and proposed liquidity requirements, many of which could have an effect on the conventional purchase market and potentially our business with the GSEs. For example, the current FHFA leadership has stated that while the GSEs\u2019 capital position remains limited compared to the amount of risk they hold, the GSEs should make risk-based decisions commensurate with their limited capital positions, which could influence the type of risk the GSEs are willing to write and the FHFA\u2019s oversight decisions regarding the GSEs. There is a heightened risk that the current FHFA leadership may seek to take actions that may have the effect of allocating a greater portion of the high-LTV market to the FHA such as the recent amendment to the PSPAs that restricts the GSEs\u2019 acquisition of higher-risk single-family mortgage loans.\nThe GSEs have in the past and may in the future pursue new products and activities in pursuit of their business strategies, including credit risk transfer transactions and structures that compete with private mortgage insurance. In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced the launch of pilot programs, IMAGIN and EPMI, respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to obtain credit enhancement and sell loans with LTVs greater than 80% to the GSEs. If these programs or any future credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to displace primary loan level or standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of mortgage insurance we write may be reduced, which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. The FHFA recently released for comment a proposed rule regarding the process for how it will consider and approve new GSE activities and products; however, this proposed rule is intended to apply to any future pilot programs, and therefore, it not certain whether the same standards and procedures proposed in the new rule also would apply to existing pilots such as IMAGIN and EPMI. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for further discussion of IMAGIN and EPMI and additional information about the proposed rule discussed above.\nThe future direction of the GSEs and their role in the housing finance system could be impacted by the recent change in Administrations. With respect to the FHFA, the Biden Administration\u2019s influence likely will be limited to the extent the FHFA continues to be led by its current leadership team, which was appointed under the Trump Administration for a five-year term beginning in April 2019. If it is determined under litigation currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court that the FHFA director is removable by the President other than for cause, the Biden Administration may move to replace the current director of the FHFA with an appointee that may be more inclined to institute the principles set forth in the Biden Administration\u2019s housing plan. These changes may include a less restrictive, more expansionary approach to the GSEs in order to provide broader access to affordable homeownership for low- and moderate-income borrowers. In addition, as compared to the current FHFA leadership team, a Biden appointed director may choose to deprioritize exiting the GSEs from conservatorship, and therefore, may be more inclined to delay the implementation of, or make changes to, the ERCF and proposed GSE liquidity requirements. A change in policy priorities at the FHFA could alter the GSEs\u2019 business practices in ways that have a significant impact on our businesses.\nAlthough we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, developments in the practices of the GSEs, including potentially new federal legislation, changes to existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations that reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminate the requirement, may diminish the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nLegislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to and may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations and may be affected by changes in these laws and regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied, as well as changes in other laws and regulations that may affect corporations more generally. In particular, our businesses may be significantly impacted by the following:\n\u25a0legislation, administrative or regulatory action impacting the charters or business practices of the GSEs;\n\u25a0reform of the U.S. housing finance system;\n\u25a0legislation and regulation impacting the FHA and its competitive position versus private mortgage insurers;\n\u25a0the enforcement of fair lending and fair servicing laws to ensure equitable housing finance and real estate markets;\n\u25a0state insurance laws and regulations that address, among other items, licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates, policy forms offered to customers and requirements for Risk-to-capital, minimum policyholder positions, reserves (including contingency reserves), surplus, reinsurance and payment of dividends;\n\u25a0the application of state, federal or private sector programs aimed at supporting borrowers and the housing market;\n\u25a0the application of RESPA, the FCRA and other laws to our businesses;\n\u25a0the application of real estate brokerage and other licensing requirements to our Real Estate businesses and strategic initiatives;\n\u25a0new federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers, including as a result of the recommendation of the Federal Insurance Office of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers be developed and implemented;\n\u25a0the application of information security and consumer privacy regulations to our businesses;\n\u25a0the implementation of new regulations under, or the potential repeal or amendment of provisions of, the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u25a0the implementation in the U.S. of the Basel III capital adequacy guidelines; and\n\u25a0broader legislative and regulatory changes, including the adoption of (or failure to adopt) new laws and regulations, or changes in existing laws and regulations, or the way they are interpreted or applied, including potential changes in tax law.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation.\u201d\nAny of the items discussed above could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our businesses could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, as well as changes to existing legislation or regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied, including changes that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time.\nRisks Related to our Mortgage and Real Estate Businesses\nOur success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks. We expect to incur losses for future defaults beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements.\nThe estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. Our mortgage insurance premium rates are based on, among other items, our expectations about competitive and economic conditions and our cost of capital, as well as a broad range of other factors and risk attributes that we consider in developing our assumptions about the credit performance of the loans we insure and the economic benefits we expect to receive from our insurance policies. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, especially in a period of high market volatility and economic uncertainty as currently exists due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of inaccurate or unreliable data may have an adverse impact on our ability to effectively perform critical business operations, such as servicing, loss management, external reporting or data-driven internal analysis. The premium structure we apply is subject to approval by state regulatory agencies, which can delay or limit our ability to increase our premiums if further filings or approvals are necessary to institute pricing adjustments.\nIf the risk underlying a mortgage loan that we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage, to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, we cannot adjust our premiums if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written. As a result, if we are unable to compensate for or offset the increased capital requirements in other ways, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nincreased capital that may be required. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, in accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists. As discussed above in \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity,\u201d the pandemic could result in a high volume of new defaults, both as a result of payment forbearance programs and otherwise, in future periods. As future defaults are not currently reflected in our mortgage insurance loss reserves, our loss reserves could increase significantly in future periods if we experience a high volume of new defaults in future periods, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims on defaulted loans. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss, including an estimate of the impact of our Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to defaulted loans. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and economic uncertainty, such as we are currently experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, claims paid may be substantially different than our loss reserves and these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. Changes to our loss reserve estimates could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, we anticipate that defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured, could remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time, resulting in a higher likelihood of claim and higher levels of Claim Severity for those loans that ultimately result in a claim. See \u201c-An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\u201d\nA portion of the defaulted loans in our portfolio originated in the years prior to and including 2008 have been in default for an extended period of time. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be less than our current estimates of Cures for this inventory of defaults, due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\nIf our loss reserve estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate mortgage insurance losses to the same extent as in prior years; Loss Mitigation Activity could continue to negatively impact our customer relationships.\nAs part of our claims management process we pursue opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after we receive claims, including processes to ensure claims are valid. Following the financial crisis, our Loss Mitigation Activities, such as Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments, increased significantly in response to the poor underwriting, servicer negligence and general non-compliance with our insurance policies that was prevalent in the period leading up to the financial crisis. These Loss Mitigation Activities materially mitigated our paid losses for loans originated and serviced during this period and resulted in a significant reduction in our loss reserves. Following the financial crisis, mortgage underwriting and servicing have generally improved, and the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity required with respect to the claims on loans originated and serviced in more recent periods has significantly decreased. As a result, our future Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate our paid losses to the same extent as it did in the years following the financial crisis. In addition, we have incorporated provisions into our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy that generally provide rescission relief based on the number of months that borrowers remain current on their mortgage loans. As a consequence, our rights to conduct Loss Mitigation Activity generally are more limited under these more recent Master Policies as compared to our prior master insurance policies.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activities and claims paying practices have resulted in disputes with certain of our customers and in some cases, damaged our relationships with customers, resulting in a loss of business. While we have resolved most all of these disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices could continue to have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers. Further, disputes with our customers that are not resolved could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings, requiring significant legal expenses, beyond those we recently experienced. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent that past or future Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices impact our customer relationships, our competitive position could be adversely affected, resulting in the potential loss of business and impacting our results of operations.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\nWe use reinsurance as a capital and risk management tool. We have distributed risk through third-party quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance arrangements, as well as through the capital markets using mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions beyond our control. For example, in 2020, the market volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily disrupted the market for new insurance-linked notes transactions before the market once again reopened for issuances. No assurance can be given that reinsurance will remain available to us in amounts that we consider sufficient and at rates and upon terms that we consider acceptable. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could cause us to increase the amount of risk we retain, negatively affect the returns we are able to achieve on the business we write and adversely affect our ability to write future business. Further, reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to policyholders, therefore, if the reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us, we remain liable to make claims payments to our policyholders. As a result, our reinsurance arrangements do not fully eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we have assumed credit risk with respect to our inability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.\nWe use reinsurance to manage Radian Guaranty\u2019s capital position under the PMIERs financial requirements. Among other benefits, our risk distribution transactions reduce our required capital, including by significantly reducing our Required Minimum Assets under the PMIERs. The initial and ongoing credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for these risk distribution transactions is subject to the periodic review of the GSEs and could be influenced by the ERCF, which significantly increases the capital requirements for the GSEs and provides the GSEs with a reduced amount of credit for their own credit risk transfer activities. See, \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses.\u201d In addition, if the GSEs revise the PMIERs in the future to align with the ERCF, such alignment could include a reduction in the credit that Radian Guaranty receives for reinsurance under the PMIERs, which could negatively impact our strategic approach to risk management and risk distribution.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms or to collect amounts due from our reinsurers, or if we receive less PMIERs capital relief for our reinsurance transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\nHigh levels of defaults and corresponding delays in foreclosures could delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory, and as a result, the Claim Severity. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the Claim Severity.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous federal and state regulatory agencies have instituted borrower relief programs, including mortgage payment forbearance and foreclosure and eviction moratoriums, with the objective of supporting borrowers through the economic hardship resulting from the pandemic and allowing borrowers to remain in their homes. In addition to the mortgage payment forbearance relief discussed above in \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity,\u201d the CARES Act also instituted temporary foreclosure and eviction moratoriums on GSE loans and GSE REO properties. The GSEs recently extended their moratoriums on single-family foreclosures and REO evictions until June 30, 2021. As a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, including the foreclosure moratorium, we anticipate that defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured, could remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time, resulting in higher levels of Claim Severity for those loans that ultimately result in a claim. Higher levels of Claim Severity would increase our incurred losses and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force could decline further and result in a decrease in our future revenues.\nMost of our primary IIF consists of policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, typically through Monthly Premium Policies, and as a result, a significant portion of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years, often with premium rates that are greater than those prevailing in the market today. The length of time that this insurance remains in force, which we refer to as the Persistency Rate, is a significant driver of our future revenues, with a lower overall Persistency Rate generally reducing our future revenues.\nPrevailing mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF affects the incentive for borrowers to refinance and therefore our Persistency Rate, with lower current interest rates making it more attractive for borrowers to refinance. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the government stimulus efforts in response to the pandemic, has resulted in a historically low interest rate environment leading to elevated levels of refinance activity. The increase in policy cancellations associated with this high level of refinance activity has reduced our Persistency Rate, and in turn, limited the growth of our IIF, which is one of the primary drivers of future premiums that we expect to earn over time. If refinance activity\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nremains elevated, resulting in earlier than anticipated loan prepayments and policy cancellations, it could result in a decrease in our future revenues, particularly from our Recurring Premium Policies.\nOther factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include:\n\u25a0applicable policies for mortgage insurance cancellation, along with the current value of the homes underlying the mortgages in our IIF;\n\u25a0the credit policies of certain lenders, which may make it more difficult for homeowners to refinance loans; and\n\u25a0economic conditions that can affect a borrower\u2019s decision to pay off a mortgage earlier than required, including the strength of the housing market, which impacts a borrower\u2019s prospects for selling their existing home and finding a suitable and affordable new home.\nIf these or other factors cause a decrease in the length of time that our Recurring Premium Policies, for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, remain in force, our future revenues could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.\nIn our mortgage insurance business, we permit lenders to obtain mortgage insurance for residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten by them using Radian\u2019s pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a mortgage loan originated by that lender based on our expectation that the lender has followed our specified underwriting guidelines. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and are able to terminate that lender\u2019s delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims.\nOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\nThe U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors primarily include other private mortgage insurers and governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA.\nWe currently compete with other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, overall service, customer relationships, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings) and reputation. Overall service competition is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, responsiveness to compliance audits, timeliness of claims payments, customer service, timely and accurate servicing of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise. We also believe that our service includes our ability to offer services to customers through our Real Estate business that are relevant to our mortgage insurance customers and complement our mortgage insurance products. For more information about our competitive environment, including pricing competition, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition.\u201d\nPricing strategies continue to evolve in the mortgage insurance industry and mortgage insurers generally have migrated to offering various pricing methodologies with differing degrees of risk-based granularity. The shift away from a predominantly rate-card-based pricing model and the increase in \u201cblack box\u201d pricing frameworks provides a more dynamic pricing environment that allows for more frequent pricing changes that can be implemented quickly and has contributed to a reduction in pricing transparency. As a result, we may not be aware of rate changes in the industry until we observe that our volume of NIW has changed. Further, among other factors, this shift to risk-based, granular pricing methodologies, together with the development of enhanced digital technologies for delivering and receiving price quotes, has led to an increasing number of customers making their choice of mortgage insurance providers based on the lowest price available for any particular loan, without consideration of other factors. The increased use of algorithms, artificial intelligence and data and analytics in the mortgage insurance industry may also lead to additional regulatory scrutiny related to other matters such as discrimination in pricing and underwriting, data privacy and access to insurance. Finally, industry pricing practices have also recently included an increased use of customized rate plans for certain customers, pursuant to which rates may be awarded to customers for only a limited periods of time, resulting in greater volatility in overall NIW as customers come onto and off of these customized rate cards.\nThe evolution of pricing changes in the mortgage insurance industry has heightened overall competition and, despite temporary pricing increases implemented throughout the industry in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has generally resulted in reduced pricing for mortgage insurance throughout the industry, including our pricing. This reduction in our premium rates is expected to decrease the premium yield of our insured portfolio over time as older vintage insured loans with higher premium rates run-off and are replaced with insured loans with lower premium rates. There can be no assurance that pricing competition will not intensify further, which could result in a decrease in our projected returns. Despite our pricing actions, we may experience returns below our targeted returns.\nOverall, our approach to pricing is customer-centric and flexible, as we offer a spectrum of risk-based pricing solutions for our customers that are designed to be balanced with our objectives for managing our volume of NIW and the risk/return profile of our insured portfolio. Although we believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively, our pricing strategy may not be successful and we may lose business to other competitors.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCertain of our private mortgage insurance competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations, may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and currently have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including in the private label securitization market or if the GSEs expand their use of, or pursue alternative forms of, credit enhancement outside of private mortgage insurance in its traditional form. In addition, because of tax advantages associated with being off-shore, which may become more pronounced if tax laws change in the future, certain of our competitors have been able to reinsure to their offshore affiliates and achieve higher after-tax rates of return on the NIW they write compared to mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty that do not have access to offshore affiliates, which could allow these off-shore competitors to leverage reduced pricing to gain market share, while continuing to achieve acceptable returns on NIW.\nWe also compete with governmental entities, such as the FHA and VA, primarily on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. These governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing guidelines and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. If these entities lower their pricing or alter the terms and conditions of their mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political, social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSince the financial crisis, the private mortgage insurance industry has improved its share of the insurable, low down-payment market, primarily by recapturing market share from the FHA, which had increased its share dramatically during and immediately following the crisis. Despite this, the FHA continues to maintain a significant market position and could increase its market position. Factors that could cause the FHA to maintain or enhance its competitive position include:\n\u25a0the Biden Administration\u2019s housing policy, which is focused on increasing access to affordable housing for low and moderate income borrowers and which HUD and the FHFA may seek to implement through decreases in the pricing of FHA insurance or changes in the terms of FHA insurance such as the current life-of-loan coverage requirement;\n\u25a0the focused efforts of the current, Trump-appointed leadership team at the FHFA to prepare the GSEs to exit conservatorship by restricting the GSEs\u2019 credit profiles and increasing their capital levels, which could have the effect of increasing the FHA\u2019s share of certain high LTV loans currently purchased by the GSEs;\n\u25a0changes to the legal requirements (e.g., compliance certifications) for conducting business with the FHA, including changes that have been implemented, to reduce the perceived risk that lenders will be subject to liability in connection with loans insured by the FHA;\n\u25a0changes to the definition of QM that were recently adopted by the CFPB and that result in a broader QM Safe Harbor definition for FHA eligible loans than GSE eligible loans;\n\u25a0capital requirements imposed on the private mortgage insurance industry;\n\u25a0the tightening by private mortgage insurers of underwriting guidelines based on credit risk concerns;\n\u25a0business changes by the GSEs, including underwriting changes, a reduction in loan limits or increases in the loan level price adjustments charged by the GSEs on loans that require mortgage insurance and changes in the amount of guarantee fees for the loans that they acquire (which may result in higher cost to borrowers); and\n\u25a0the perceived operational ease of using FHA insurance compared to the products of private mortgage insurers.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs\u2019 Business Practices\u201d for further discussion of factors that could impact the FHA\u2019s competitive position relative to private mortgage insurance, including: (i) the FHFA\u2019s current focus on preparing the GSEs to exit conservatorship; (ii) the likely focus of the Biden Administration and HUD and FHA on increasing mortgage accessibility and affordability for low- and moderate-income borrowers; and (iii) the recent changes to the QM definition that could make execution through the FHA more attractive for certain high-LTV loans.\nWe have also faced increasing competition from the VA. We believe that the VA\u2019s market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount with no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA\u2019s program.\nIn addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance in its traditional form, including:\n\u25a0structures, such as the IMAGIN and EPMI pilot programs launched in 2018 by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae;\n\u25a0lenders and other investors holding mortgages in their portfolio and self-insuring;\n\u25a0lenders using pass-through vehicles that take on the risk of loss for loans ultimately sold to the GSEs;\n\u25a0structured risk transfer transactions in the capital markets;\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u25a0risk sharing, risk transfer or using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage;\n\u25a0lenders originating mortgages using \u201cpiggyback\u201d structures to avoid private mortgage insurance, such as a first-lien mortgage with an 80% LTV and a second mortgage with a 10%, 15% or 20% LTV; and\n\u25a0other potential forms of credit enhancement that do not involve private mortgage insurance.\nSee \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our businesses.\u201d\nThe competitive environment is extremely challenging given the multitude of factors discussed above. This environment, as well as potential further changes to this evolving environment, could negatively impact our franchise value, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.\nOur mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they conduct with us directly and their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value.\nIf we were to lose a significant customer, it is unlikely that the loss could be completely offset by other customers in the near-term, if at all. Some of our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s information security and other compliance programs, pricing levels and pricing delivery methods, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Alternatively, certain other lending customers have chosen for risk management purposes to diversify the mortgage insurers with which they do business, which may negatively affect our level of NIW and market share with those customers. Given that many of our customers currently give us a significant portion of their total mortgage insurance business, it is possible that further diversification could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the market share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers. Further, we actively engage with our customers to ensure that we are receiving an appropriate mix of business from such customers at acceptable projected returns, and depending on the circumstances, we could take action with respect to customers (e.g., limiting the type of business we accept from them or instituting pricing changes that impact them) that could result in customers reducing the amount of business they do with us or deciding not to do business with us altogether. Finally, although we seek to develop our product offerings and strategies to be complementary to our customers, we currently offer and may offer in the future, products that could be viewed as competitive to products offered by certain of our customers, which could influence a customer\u2019s decision as to whether to do business with us. Any significant loss in our market share could negatively impact our mortgage insurance franchise, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position and potential downgrades by rating agencies to these ratings and the ratings assigned to Radian Group could adversely affect the Company.\nRadian Guaranty has been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody\u2019s, a rating of BBB+ by S&P and a rating of A- by Fitch. While Radian Guaranty\u2019s financial strength ratings currently are investment grade, certain of these ratings are below the ratings assigned to certain other private mortgage insurers. We do not believe our ratings have had a material adverse effect on our relationships with existing customers. However, if financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings. In addition, while the current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, if this were to change in the future, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under the PMIERs. The recently finalized ERCF generally provides more capital credit for transactions with higher rated counterparties, which if translated to the PMIERS in the future, could potentially become a competitive disadvantage for us.\nThe GSEs currently consider financial strength ratings, among other items, to determine the amount of collateral that an insurer must post when participating in the credit risk transfer transactions currently being conducted by the GSEs. As a result, the returns that we are able to achieve when participating in these transactions are dependent, in part, on our financial strength ratings. We currently use Radian Reinsurance to participate in the GSEs\u2019 credit risk transfer transactions. Radian Reinsurance has been assigned a rating of BBB+ by S&P. Market participants with higher ratings than us are assigned lower collateral requirements by the GSEs for these transactions and generally have a lower cost of capital, which may give them a competitive advantage, including the ability to price more aggressively for these transactions.\nWe believe that financial strength ratings remain a significant consideration for participants seeking to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-QM loans. While this market has remained limited since the financial crisis and has further contracted as a result of COVID-19, we view this market as an area of potential long-term future growth, and our ability to successfully participate in this market could depend on our ability to secure higher ratings\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nfor our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs no longer operate in their current capacity, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role.\nThe rating agencies continually review the financial strength ratings assigned to Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries, and the ratings are subject to change. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our financial results and condition, could cause one or more of the rating agencies to downgrade the ratings assigned to Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries. Currently, S&P and Fitch have assigned a negative outlook for the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and Radian Group senior debt. Downgrades to the ratings of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and Radian Group could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, access to capital markets and competitive position. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected.\nOur business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\nWe depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing is necessary for timely billing and premium payments to us and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans. Servicers are required to comply with a multitude of legal and regulatory requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgages such as the CFPB\u2019s mortgage servicing rules. While these requirements are intended to ensure a high level of servicing performance, they also impose a high cost of compliance on servicers that may impact their financial condition and their operating effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional burdens on many servicers. Challenging economic and market conditions or periods of economic stress and high mortgage defaults such as currently exist make it more difficult for servicers to effectively service the loans that we insure. Further, the various servicing-related requirements imposed by the CARES Act, the GSEs, the FHA and other federal and state governmental and regulatory bodies and agencies to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortgage borrowers heighten the burdens placed on servicers in the current environment. Servicer performance may be further stressed due to the short timeframe over which these events have occurred, which has resulted in a high volume of COVID-19 related servicing demands, such as administering forbearance requests for borrowers, generally occurring and moving forward on similar timeframes.\nInformation with respect to the mortgage loans we insure is based in large part on information reported to us by third parties, including the servicers and originators of the mortgage loans, and information presented may be subject to lapses or inaccuracies in reporting from such third parties. In many cases, we may not be aware that information reported to us is incorrect until such time as a claim is made against us under the relevant insurance policy. We do not receive monthly information from servicers for single premium policies, and may not be aware that the mortgage loans insured by such policies have been repaid. We periodically attempt to determine if coverage is still in force on such policies by asking the last servicer of record or through the periodic reconciliation of loan information with certain servicers. It may be possible that our reports continue to reflect, as active, policies on mortgage loans that have been repaid.\nIn the event a borrower fails to make mortgage payments, including as the result of a forbearance program, servicers often are required to advance such amounts, including principal and interest on the mortgage and amounts to cover taxes and insurance, for a period of time, including with respect to loans purchased by the GSEs. These required \u201cadvances\u201d may increase the financial strain on servicers, which could negatively impact their financial condition or otherwise disrupt their operations; although currently, in response to the pandemic, the FHFA and GSEs have implemented a four-month limit on servicer advance obligations for loans in forbearance which has reduced this financial burden. If we experience a disruption in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies or a failure by servicers to appropriately report the status of a loan, including whether the loan is subject to a COVID-19 related forbearance program, this, in turn, could impact the amount of assets Radian Guaranty is required to hold under the PMIERs or ultimately contribute to a rise in claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUnder the terms of our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy, mortgage insurance premiums are not required to be paid following an event of default. However, if a defaulted loan then cures, all mortgage insurance premiums must be brought current for our insurance coverage to continue, including all premiums that were not paid during the period following the event of default and through the date of cure. Because premiums must be brought current upon a cure, mortgage servicers typically continue to pay mortgage insurance premiums while loans remain in default, understanding that Radian Guaranty will refund these premiums if the loans fail to cure and ultimately go to claim. As part of the National Emergency Guidelines, the GSEs temporarily amended the PMIERs to require that mortgage insurers notify the GSEs before coverage is canceled in specific circumstances, and to give the GSEs the opportunity to pay the premium on behalf of the servicer to keep coverage in force. If we fail to receive mortgage insurance premiums following mortgage defaults, Radian Guaranty\u2019s cash flow could be materially reduced, potentially requiring Radian Guaranty to liquidate investments at a loss to pay future claims or otherwise requiring us to alter our investment strategy.\nWe face risks associated with our contract underwriting business.\nWe provide third-party contract underwriting services for our mortgage insurance customers. Generally, we offer limited indemnification to our contract underwriting customers. In addition to indemnification, we typically have limited loss mitigation\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\ndefenses available to us for loans that we have underwritten through our contract underwriting services. As a consequence, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to indemnify our customers for material underwriting errors in our contract underwriting services.\nA decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business and conduct our Real Estate business.\nThe amount of new mortgage insurance business we write and real estate transactions we support depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low down payment mortgages that benefit from our mortgage insurance and the volume of real estate transactions that require our services or products. The volume of mortgage originations is impacted by a number of factors, including:\n\u25a0restrictions on mortgage credit due to changes in lender underwriting standards, capital requirements affecting lenders, regulatory requirements such as the QM designation for mortgage loans (as further discussed below), and the health of the private securitization market;\n\u25a0mortgage interest rates;\n\u25a0the health of the domestic economy generally, as well as specific conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u25a0housing supply and affordability;\n\u25a0tax laws and policies and their impact on, among other things, deductions for mortgage insurance premiums, mortgage interest payments and real estate taxes;\n\u25a0demographic trends, including the rate of household formation;\n\u25a0the rate of home price appreciation;\n\u25a0government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and\n\u25a0the practices of the GSEs, including the extent to which the guaranty fees, loan level price adjustments, credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect the cost of mortgages and lenders\u2019 willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, mortgage lenders must make a reasonable and good faith determination that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan (the \u201cAbility to Repay Rule\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Act provides that a creditor may presume that a borrower will be able to repay a loan if the loan has certain low-risk characteristics that meet the definition of a qualified mortgage (\u201cQM Rule\u201d). This QM presumption is generally rebuttable, however, loans that are deemed to have the lowest risk profiles are granted a safe harbor from liability (\u201cQM Safe Harbor\u201d) related to the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan.\nIn implementing the QM Rule, the CFPB established rigorous underwriting and product feature requirements for the loans to be deemed qualified mortgages (\u201cCurrent QM Definition\u201d), including that the borrower does not exceed a 43% debt-to-income ratio after giving effect to the loan. As part of the Current QM Definition, the CFPB also created a special exemption for the GSEs, which is generally referred to as the \u201cQM Patch,\u201d that allows any loan that meets the GSE underwriting and product feature requirements to be deemed to be a qualified mortgage, or QM, regardless of whether the loan exceeds the 43% debt-to-income ratio. The QM Patch expires on July 1, 2021.\nIn December 2020, the CFPB issued a new QM definition (\u201cNew QM Definition\u201d) that replaces the underwriting focused approach of the Current QM Definition, including the 43% debt-to-income ratio limitation, with a new pricing-based approach to QM. Under the New QM Definition, certain underwriting considerations are retained, but QM status generally is achieved if the loan is priced at no greater than 2.25% above the Average Prime Offer Rate (\u201cAPOR\u201d). Loans priced at or less than 1.5% above APOR are subject to the QM Safe Harbor, while all other QM loans would receive the general rebuttable presumption that the loans met the ability to repay standard. The New QM Definition is intended to replace the current QM Patch, which if implemented, is expected to effectively reduce the number of loans that would be designated QM compared to those receiving QM designation under the QM Patch, although not materially. The New QM Definition is effective March 1, 2021 and has a mandatory compliance deadline of July 1, 2021, at which time it is intended to replace the QM Patch. However, on February 23, 2021, the CFPB announced that it expects to issue a proposed rule to delay the July 1, 2021 mandatory compliance deadline for the New QM Definition and that if this proposed rule is finalized, then: (1) the QM Patch would remain in place until the earlier of the delayed mandatory compliance date or the date that the GSEs exit conservatorship; and (2) between the March 1, 2021 effective date of the New QM Definition and the delayed mandatory compliance date, market participants could satisfy the QM Rule under either the Current QM Definition or the New QM Definition. In December 2020, the CFPB also created a new QM category (\u201cSeasoned QM\u201d) for first-lien, fixed-rate loans that meet certain performance requirements over a 36-month seasoning period and are held in the lender\u2019s portfolio until the end of the seasoning period. As part of its February 23, 2021 announcement, the CFPB stated that it was evaluating whether to initiate a new rule to reconsider the Seasoned QM definition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also granted the FHA, VA and the USDA flexibility to establish their own definitions of qualified mortgages for their insurance guaranty programs. Both the FHA and VA have created their own definition of qualified mortgages that differ from both the CFPB\u2019s Current QM Definition and New QM Definition. For example, the FHA\u2019s QM Safe Harbor\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\ndefinition currently applies to loans priced at or less than APOR plus the sum of 115 basis points and the FHA\u2019s annual mortgage insurance premium rate, which is effectively broader than the QM Safe Harbor adopted under the New QM Definition. These alternate definitions of qualified mortgages are more favorable to lenders and mortgage holders than the CFPB\u2019s Current QM Definition and New QM Definition that apply to loans purchased by the GSEs, which could drive business to these agencies and have a negative impact on our mortgage insurance business.\nTo date, the housing and real estate markets have been able to withstand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with markets generally supported by low interest rates, favorable demographics supporting growth in the population of first-time homebuyers and a relatively constrained supply of homes available for sale. However, the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic remains uncertain and unfavorable developments with respect to unemployment, consumer confidence and underwriting standards, as well as the implementation of public and private sector initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the continued imposition of restrictions on business activities, could affect the number of new mortgages available for us to insure and real estate transactions available for our services.\nIf the overall volume of new mortgage originations declines, we would likely be subject to increased competition and we could experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and provide our real estate services, which could negatively affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with our Real Estate business.\nOur Real Estate business exposes us to certain risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, including, among others, the following:\n\u25a0Our Real Estate business is driven primarily by digital products and services, including software as a service solutions and proprietary technology platforms that depend on our ability to develop, launch and implement new and innovative technologies and digital solutions and expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that include, without limitation, challenges associated with new and rapidly evolving technologies and business environments, customer acceptance of our digital product and service offerings, the costs associated with the development and launch of these technologies and products, our failure to successfully integrate new technologies into our existing systems and the risk that our digital product and services offerings fail to operate as expected or planned or that expose us to additional cybersecurity or third party risks;\n\u25a0Our Real Estate revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our Real Estate total revenues. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, Radian Guaranty does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted;\n\u25a0Due to the transactional nature of our business, our Real Estate segment revenues are subject to fluctuation from period to period and are difficult to predict;\n\u25a0The services we offer through our Real Estate business are influenced by the level of overall activity in the mortgage, real estate and mortgage finance markets generally. If real estate transaction volumes decline, we could experience less demand for our real estate and title services;\n\u25a0Red Bell is a licensed real estate brokerage and provides real estate brokerage services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a licensed real estate brokerage, Red Bell receives residential real estate information from various multiple listing services (\u201cMLS\u201d). Red Bell receives this information, which it uses in its business to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the MLS providers. If these agreements were to terminate or Red Bell otherwise were to lose access to this information, it could negatively impact Red Bell\u2019s ability to conduct its business and our future real estate strategies; and\n\u25a0By their nature, title claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. From time to time, we could experience large losses or an overall worsening of our loss payment experience in regard to the frequency or severity of claims that require us to record additional charges to our claims loss reserve. These loss events are unpredictable and could adversely affect the financial performance of our Real Estate business.\nRisks Related to the Economic Environment\nThe credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages.\nAs a seller of mortgage credit protection, our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, including events that impact mortgage originations and the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio. Many of these conditions are beyond our control, including housing prices, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other factors that may be derived from national and\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nregional economic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has created periods of significant economic disruption, high unemployment, volatility and disruption in financial markets, and required adjustments in the housing finance system and real estate markets. In general, challenging economic conditions such as we are currently experiencing increase the likelihood that borrowers will be unable to satisfy their mortgage obligations. A deteriorating economy can adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so.\nMortgage defaults can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, among other events. In addition, factors impacting regional economic conditions, acts of terrorism, war or other severe conflicts, event-specific economic depressions, severe weather events and natural disasters which may be exacerbated in severity or frequency due to climate change and other catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased defaults due to the impact of such events on the ability of borrowers to satisfy their mortgage obligations and the value of affected homes. Further, as discussed above under \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity,\u201d mortgage forbearance programs available as a result of COVID-19 may continue to result in an elevated level of new defaults. Due to these factors, among others, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a negative impact on the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, including potential further increases in defaults and losses. The pandemic\u2019s effect on the number of new defaults and level of losses will depend, among other factors, on the pandemic\u2019s scope, severity and duration, its resulting impact on the economy including unemployment and housing prices, and the ability of current and any future government programs to provide economic and individual relief, all of which will likely have an impact on borrowers\u2019 ability to remain current on their mortgage payments, and if they have entered into forbearance or other relief programs, to resume making payments upon the expiration of the forbearance period.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic developments, including the current ongoing economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the other factors cited above, may continue to have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists primarily of highly-rated fixed income investments, our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities, and as such, we may not achieve our investment objectives. Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we invest has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, including most recently as a result of the disruption in the financial markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, when the credit environment experiences deterioration, such as occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of impairments of our investments could increase. LIBOR, U.S. Treasury yields and credit spreads have declined, which could further lower investment yields. If the financial markets experience additional disruption and volatility, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rates and investment yields on our investments continue to be low compared to historical averages, which has reduced the investment yield on our investment portfolio. For the significant portion of our investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiaries, to receive favorable treatment under insurance regulatory requirements and full credit as Available Assets under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in investment grade fixed income investments that are unlikely to increase our overall investment yields. Because we depend on our investments as a source of revenue, a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, future updates to the Model Act or PMIERs could restrict our investment choices, which could negatively impact our investment strategy.\nIn addition, we structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our future claim payments or other liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our trading securities, equity securities and short-term investments that require us to adjust their fair market value.\nWe have significant holdings of trading securities, equity securities and short-term investments that we carry at fair value. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations each period, they affect our reported earnings and can create earnings volatility. Among other factors, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nUncertainty relating to the potential discontinuance of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect us.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit rate quotations required to calculate LIBOR. As a result, it is uncertain whether LIBOR will continue to be quoted after 2021. Efforts are underway to identify and transition to a set of alternative reference rates. The set of alternative rates includes the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing in 2018. In addition, central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. There is considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of LIBOR in financial instruments that are indexed to LIBOR. Financial instruments indexed to LIBOR could experience disparate outcomes based on their contractual terms, ability to amend those terms, market or product type, legal or regulatory jurisdiction, and other factors. Alternative reference rates that replace LIBOR may not yield the same or similar economic results over the lives of the financial instruments, which could adversely affect the value of and return on these instruments.\nAny changes to or discontinuation of LIBOR may have an adverse effect on the premium rates we are required to pay in connection with our existing insurance-linked notes transactions, which are tied to LIBOR, or other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to LIBOR or to a LIBOR alternative, including floating rate bonds that we hold in our investment portfolio and borrowings under our credit facility which currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. Furthermore, changes to or the discontinuation of LIBOR may impact our investment portfolio and our cost of debt, as well as other aspects of our business, such as our insurance products, the pricing we charge and the models we use to support our business decisions. It is possible that the discontinuance or replacement of LIBOR, including the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Liquidity and Financing\nRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\nRadian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. As of December 31, 2020, Radian Group had available, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of $1.1 billion. This amount excludes certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced to Radian Group from our subsidiaries for corporate expenses and interest payments. Total liquidity, which includes our undrawn $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity Analysis-Holding Company\u201d for more information on our liquidity demands, including as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience an elevated level of new defaults in future periods. The number, timing and duration of new defaults and, in turn, the number of defaults that ultimately result in claims will depend, among other factors, on the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the resulting impact on the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and the impact of government programs to provide economic and individual relief. If existing and future new defaults materially reduce Radian Guaranty\u2019s PMIERs Cushion, we may be required or otherwise choose to contribute capital to Radian Guaranty. The amount that Radian Group could be required to contribute to Radian Guaranty could be significant and, under extreme economic scenarios, exhaust Radian Group\u2019s available liquidity. See \u201c-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity\u201d above for additional information.\nIn addition to available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group\u2019s most significant near-term sources of cash to fund future liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group by its subsidiaries under expense- and tax-sharing arrangements and; (ii) net investment income earned on its cash and marketable securities. Radian Group\u2019s expense-sharing arrangements with its principal operating subsidiaries require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on Radian Group\u2019s outstanding senior notes. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time.\nIn light of Radian Guaranty\u2019s negative unassigned surplus related to operating losses in prior periods, the ongoing need to set aside contingency reserves, and the current ongoing economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could increase losses in future periods, we do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group for the foreseeable future. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on contingency reserve requirements. In addition, pursuant to the National Emergency Guidelines, through June 30, 2021, the consent of the GSEs is required for Radian Guaranty to: (i) pay dividends or make payments of principal or increase payments of interest beyond those commitments made prior to June 30, 2020 associated with the Surplus Notes; (ii) make any other payments, unless related to expenses incurred in the normal course of business or to commitments made prior to June 30, 2020; (iii) pledge or transfer asset(s) to any affiliate or investor; or (iv) enter into any new arrangements or alter any existing arrangements under tax sharing and intercompany expense-sharing agreements other than renewals and extensions of agreements in effect prior to June 30, 2020. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or to Radian Group.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn light of Radian Group\u2019s short- and long-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund our obligations and could exceed available holding company funds. If this were to occur, we may need or otherwise may decide to increase our available liquidity, which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility. A default under our credit facility could trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. We may not have access to funding under our credit facility when we require it.\nRadian Group is a party to a $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. As of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility.\nThe credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, provide certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies and pay dividends. The credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and further provides that: (i) Radian Group must be rated by S&P or Moody\u2019s and (ii) Radian Guaranty must remain eligible under the PMIERs to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. A failure to comply with these covenants or the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default, which could: (a) result in the termination of the commitments by the lenders to make loans to Radian Group under the credit facility and (b) enable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility, any outstanding obligations under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable.\nFurther, the occurrence of an event of default under the terms of our credit facility may trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. An event of default would occur under the terms of our senior notes if a default: (i) in any scheduled payment of principal of other indebtedness by Radian Group or its subsidiaries of more than $100 million principal amount occurs, after giving effect to any applicable grace period or (ii) in the performance of any term or provision of any indebtedness of Radian Group or its subsidiaries in excess of $100 million principal amount occurs that results in the acceleration of the date such indebtedness is due and payable, subject to certain limited exceptions. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the carrying value of our senior notes.\nIf the commitments of the lenders under the credit facility are terminated or we are unable to satisfy certain covenants or representations, we may not have access to funding in a timely manner, or at all, when we require it. If funding is not available under the credit facility when we require it, our ability to continue our business practices or pursue our current strategy could be limited. If the indebtedness under the credit facility or our senior notes is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.\nOur credit facility terminates on January 18, 2022 and we may be unable to renew or replace this facility on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain new financing or funding when needed, or if there were to be an event of default under our credit facility or senior notes for any reason, our cash flows, financial results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity\nOur information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion.\nAdditionally, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. We rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide our products and services to our customers, and they generally require that we provide an increasing number of our products and services electronically. Accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or are otherwise unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. Further, customers may choose to do business only with business partners with which they are technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing relationships with mortgage insurance or mortgage and real estate services providers rather than invest the time and resources to on-board new providers. As a result, technology can represent a potential barrier to signing new customers.\nBecause we rely on our information technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail, experience a prolonged interruption, or become outmoded, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe could incur significant liability or reputational harm if the security of our information technology systems is breached, including as result of a cyberattack, or we otherwise fail to protect confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect the electronic information, financial data and proprietary models that are critical to our business. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between us and our employees, customers, business partners and service providers depends on information technology and electronic information exchange.\nOur reliance on information technology has been further accelerated by the widespread transition to work-from-home measures following the outbreak of COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to protect our employees and in response to governmental and other third-party measures restricting interpersonal contact, travel and business operations, we activated our business continuity program by transitioning to a work-from-home virtual workforce model. Remote working arrangements may increase the risk of cyber-security attacks or data security incidents.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks, including cyberattacks. In recent years, cyberattacks such as distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering and insider threats designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or to cause other damage have grown in volume and level of sophistication. The risks of cyberattacks and information security breaches continue to increase in businesses such as ours due to, among other things, the proliferation of new technologies and the use of digital channels to conduct our business, including connectivity with customer devices that are beyond our security control systems and the use of portable computers or mobile devices which can be stolen, lost or damaged.\nAs part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on borrowers, consumers and our employees. If the security of our information technology is breached, including as a result of a cyberattack, it could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our customer relationships and reputation. While we have information security policies, controls and systems in place in order to attempt to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. Any cybersecurity event or other compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, regulatory scrutiny and action, damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to attract and maintain customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally\nWe may not continue to pay dividends at the same rate we are currently paying them, or at all, and any decrease in or suspension of payment of a dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nEffective February 13, 2020, Radian Group\u2019s board of directors authorized an increase to the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend to $0.125 per share effective for the quarterly dividend payable in March 2020. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to the determination each quarter by our board of directors that the dividend remains in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including, among others, economic conditions, our earnings, financial condition, actual and forecasted cash flows, capital resources, capital requirements and alternative uses of capital, including potential investments to support our business strategy and possible acquisitions or investments in new businesses. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that are subject to a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. We often are a party to material litigation and also are subject to legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Additional lawsuits, legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of existing and future legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nour workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals, that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us, or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including costs associated with a loss of productivity and costs to replace employees, may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe may make investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new business initiatives, acquire other companies or engage in other strategic initiatives, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties.\nIn support of our growth and diversification strategy, we may make strategic investments, acquisitions or pursue other strategic initiatives that expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that include, without limitation:\n\u25a0the use of capital and potential diversion of other resources, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses and potential disruption of those businesses;\n\u25a0the assumption of liabilities in connection with any strategic investment, including any acquired business;\n\u25a0our ability to comply with additional regulatory requirements associated with new products, services, lines of business, or other business or strategic initiatives;\n\u25a0our ability to successfully integrate or develop the operations of any new business initiative or acquisition;\n\u25a0the possibility that any new business initiatives may be disruptive to, or competitive with, our existing customers;\n\u25a0the possibility that we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other strategic investment or initiative, including expected synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities, within the anticipated timeframe or at all; and\n\u25a0the possibility that we may fail to achieve forecasted results for a strategic investment, acquisition or other initiative that could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or impairment charges associated with intangible assets acquired.", "PERMNO": 78038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "RDN"}
