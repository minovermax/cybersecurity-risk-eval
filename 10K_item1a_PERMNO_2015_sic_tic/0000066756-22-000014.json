{"cik": "66756", "company": "ALLETE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties discussed below could materially affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and should be carefully considered by stakeholders. The risks and uncertainties in this section are not the only ones we face; additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, the risks described below should be carefully considered together with other information set forth in this report and in future reports that we file with the SEC.\nRegulated Operations Risks\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted if our taconite, paper and pipeline customers experience an economic downturn, incur work stoppages, fail to compete effectively, experience decreased demand, fail to economically obtain raw materials, fail to renew or obtain necessary permits, or experience a decline in prices for their product.\nMinnesota Power\u2019s Large Power Customers (see Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations - Electric Sales / Customers) and Silver Bay Power accounted for 32 percent of our 2021 consolidated operating revenue (29 percent in 2020 and 30 percent in 2019) and 37 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue (34 percent in 2020 and 36 percent in 2019). Minnesota Power\u2019s taconite customers, which are currently owned by only two entities at the end of 2021, accounted for approximately 28 percent of consolidated operating revenue and 32 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue in 2021. These customers are involved in cyclical industries that by their nature are adversely impacted by economic downturns and are subject to strong competition in the marketplace. The North American paper and pulp industry also faces declining demand due to the impact of electronic substitution for print and changing customer needs. As a result, certain paper and pulp customers have reduced their existing operations or idled facilities in recent years and have pursued or are pursuing product changes in response to declining demand. Additionally, the taconite industry could be impacted by changing technology in the steel industry such as the adoption of electric arc furnaces for steelmaking, which could result in declining demand for taconite and the electricity used during its production.\nMinnesota Power also serves two pipeline customers that accounted for 2 percent of our 2021 consolidated operating revenue (2 percent in 2020 and in 2019) and 2 percent of Regulated Operations revenue in 2021 (3 percent in 2020 and 3 percent in 2019). These customers are involved in an industry that is seeing increased environmental pressure for construction of new or expanded pipeline infrastructure for the transportation of fossil fuels. Changes in regulatory rulings or permit proceedings could result in changes to operations of the pipeline network in our service territory.\nAccordingly, if our industrial customers experience an economic downturn, incur a work stoppage (including strikes, lock-outs or other events), fail to compete effectively, experience decreased demand, fail to economically obtain raw materials, fail to renew or obtain necessary permits, or experience a decline in prices for their product, there could be adverse effects on their operations and, consequently, this could have a negative impact on our results of operations as we are unable to remarket at similar prices the energy that would otherwise have been sold to such customers. These customers have also been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. (See Entity-wide Risks.)\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategic objectives of growing load at our utilities if current or potential industrial or municipal customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans, including the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits and approvals.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we pursue new wholesale and retail loads in and around our service territories. Currently, there are several companies in northeastern Minnesota that are in the process of developing natural resource-based projects that represent long-term growth potential and load diversity for our Regulated Operations businesses. These projects may include construction of new facilities and restarts of old facilities, both of which require permitting and approvals to be obtained before the projects can be successfully implemented. If a project does not obtain any necessary governmental (including environmental) permits and approvals or if these customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans, our long-term strategy and thus our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework under federal and state laws as well as regulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state law including regulations administered by the FERC, MPUC, MPCA, PSCW, NDPSC and EPA as well as regulations administered by other organizations including the NERC. These laws and regulations relate to allowed rates of return, capital structure, financings, rate and cost structure, acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, construction and operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities (including the ongoing maintenance and reliable operation of such facilities), recovery of purchased power costs and capital investments, approval of integrated resource plans and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition, renewable portfolio standards that require utilities to obtain specified percentages of electric supply from eligible renewable generation sources, among other things. Energy policy initiatives at the state or federal level could increase renewable portfolio standards or incentives for distributed generation, municipal utility ownership, or local initiatives could introduce generation or distribution requirements that could change the current integrated utility model. Our transmission systems and electric generation facilities are subject to the NERC mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. Compliance with these standards may lead to increased operating costs and capital expenditures which are subject to regulatory approval for recovery. If it was determined that we were not in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards or other statutes, rules and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations significantly influence our operations and may affect our ability to recover costs from our customers. We are required to have numerous permits, licenses, approvals and certificates from the agencies and other organizations that regulate our business. We believe we have obtained the necessary permits, licenses, approvals and certificates for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies and other organizations. Changes in regulations, timing of approvals, the adoption of new regulations or the expansion of jurisdiction by these agencies and other organizations could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain reasonable rates of return depends upon regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot provide assurance that rate adjustments will be obtained or reasonable authorized rates of return on capital will be earned. Minnesota Power and SWL&P, from time to time, file general rate cases with, or otherwise seek cost recovery authorization from, federal and state regulatory authorities. If Minnesota Power and SWL&P do not receive an adequate amount of rate relief in general rate cases, including if rates are reduced, if increased rates are not approved or recovered on a timely basis, if fuel adjustment clause recoveries or cost recovery for other items are not granted at the requested level, or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through rates, we may experience an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and results of operations from future legislation or regulatory activities of any of these agencies or organizations.\nOur regulated operations present certain environmental risks that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, including effects of environmental laws and regulations, physical risks associated with climate change and initiatives designed to reduce the impact of GHG emissions.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our past, present and future operations, including air quality, water quality and usage, waste management, reclamation, hazardous wastes, avian mortality and natural resources. These laws and regulations, or new laws and regulations that may be passed, can result in increased capital expenditures and increased operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations, particularly with regard to laws relating to emissions, coal ash and water discharge at generating facilities.\nThese laws and regulations could restrict the output of some existing facilities, limit the use of some fuels in the production of electricity, require the installation of additional pollution control equipment, require participation in environmental emission allowance trading, and lead to other environmental considerations and costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nThese laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Violations of these laws and regulations could expose us to regulatory and legal proceedings, disputes with, and legal challenges by, governmental authorities and private parties, as well as potential significant civil fines criminal penalties and other sanctions.\nExisting environmental regulations may be revised and new environmental regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding if and when new laws, regulations or administrative policies will be adopted to reduce or limit GHG and the impact any such laws or regulations would have on us. In 2021, our operating coal-fired generating facilities consisted of the 355 MW Boswell Unit 3 and the 468 MW Boswell Unit 4. (See Outlook - EnergyForward.) Any future limits on GHG emissions at the federal or state level, or action taken by regulators, before these facilities are retired or become coal-free may require us to incur significant capital expenditures and increases in operating costs, or could result in early closure of coal-fired generating facilities, stranded assets, an impairment of assets, denial of full recovery of decommissioning costs in excess of amounts previously collected, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if resulting expenditures and costs are not fully recoverable from customers.\nOur regulated operations may be adversely impacted by the physical and financial risks associated with climate change. See Entity-wide Risks for additional discussion of risks related to GHG and climate change.\nWe cannot predict the amount or timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of uncertainty as to applicable regulations or requirements. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. Violations of certain environmental statutes, rules and regulations could expose ALLETE to third party disputes and potentially significant monetary penalties, as well as other sanctions for non-compliance.\nThe operation and maintenance of our regulated electric generation and transmission facilities are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up operational risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, the dependence on a specific fuel source, inadequate fuel supply, availability of fuel transportation, and the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. A significant portion of our facilities contain older generating equipment, which, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to continue operating at peak efficiency. Generation and transmission facilities and equipment are also likely to require periodic upgrades and improvements due to changing environmental standards and technological advances. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce or deliver power, including failure caused by breakdown, forced outage or limited availability of fuel or fuel transportation, as well as the repair of damage to facilities due to breakdown, storms, natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events. This could also lead to requiring additional purchased power to meet requirements of serving our retail load, which for Minnesota Power is subject to recovery under the fuel adjustment clause. Should these costs be denied or are otherwise unable to be recovered, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to successfully and timely complete capital repairs or improvements to existing regulated facilities or other capital projects is contingent upon many variables.\nWe expect to incur significant capital expenditures in making capital repairs or improvements to our existing electric generation and transmission facilities and in the development and construction of new electric generation and transmission facilities. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful, not completed in a timely manner or if there are increases in the costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services, we could be subject to additional costs or impairments which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nOur regulated electric generating operations may not have access to adequate and reliable transmission and distribution facilities necessary to deliver electricity to our customers.\nWe depend on our own transmission and distribution facilities, as well as facilities owned by other utilities, to deliver the electricity produced and sold to our customers, and to other energy suppliers. If transmission capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver electricity may be limited. We may have to forgo sales or may have to buy more expensive wholesale electricity that is available in the capacity-constrained area. In addition, any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact the satisfaction of our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe price of electricity may be volatile and fuel may be volatile and availability may be limited.\nVolatility in market prices for electricity and volatility and limited availability of fuel could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations and may result from:\n\u2022severe or unexpected weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022seasonality;\n\u2022changes in electricity usage;\n\u2022transmission or transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies;\n\u2022availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;\n\u2022changes in supply and demand for energy;\n\u2022changes in power production capacity;\n\u2022outages at our generating facilities or those of our competitors;\n\u2022availability of fuel and transportation of fuel;\n\u2022changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022wars, sabotage, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events; and\n\u2022federal, state, local and foreign energy, environmental, or other regulation and legislation.\nVolatility in market prices for our fuel and purchase power costs impacts our sales to retail, municipal and Other Power Suppliers. Fluctuations in our fuel and purchased power costs related to our retail and municipal customers are passed on to customers through the fuel adjustment clause; however, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted if increased fuel adjustment clause rates are not approved or recovered on a timely basis, if cost recovery is not granted at the requested level, or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause.\nWholesale prices for electricity have also declined in recent years primarily due to low natural gas prices, the extension of renewable tax credits and additional renewable generation commencing operations. If there are reductions in demand from current customers, we lose retail customers, or we lose municipal customers that do not renew existing contracts, we will market any available power to Other Power Suppliers in an effort to mitigate any earnings impact. Sales to Other Power Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations. Due to wholesale prices for electricity being below our rates for retail and municipal customers, we do not expect that our power marketing efforts would fully offset the reduction in earnings resulting from the lower demand from existing customers or the loss of customers. (See Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations - Electric Sales / Customers.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nDemand for energy may decrease.\nOur results of operations are impacted by the demand for energy in our service territories, our municipal customers and other power suppliers. There could be lower demand for energy due to a loss of customers as a result of economic conditions, customers constructing or installing their own generation facilities, higher costs and rates charged to customers, eligible municipal and other power suppliers choosing an alternative energy provider, or loss of service territory or franchises. Further, energy conservation and technological advances that increased energy efficiency may temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for energy products. In addition, we are impacted by state and federal regulations requiring mandatory conservation measures, which reduce the demand for energy products. Continuing technology improvements and regulatory developments may make customer and third party-owned generation technologies such as rooftop solar systems, WTGs, microturbines and battery storage systems more cost effective and feasible for of our customers. If customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline. There may not be future economic growth opportunities that would enable us to replace the lost energy demand from these customers. Therefore, a decrease in demand for energy could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks\nThe inability to successfully manage and grow ALLETE Clean Energy and our Corporate and Other businesses could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company's strategy includes adding customers, new geographies, and growth through acquisitions or project development with long-term PSAs in place for the output or to be sold upon completion. This strategy depends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition or development opportunities and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms. The Company may compete with other companies for these acquisition and development opportunities, which may increase the Company\u2019s cost of making acquisitions and the Company may be unsuccessful in pursuing these acquisition opportunities. Other companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than the Company\u2019s financial or human resources permit. New laws and regulations promoting renewable energy generation may result in increased competition. Our ALLETE Clean Energy business is experiencing return pressures from increased competition, and lower forward price curves, as a growing amount of investment capital is being directed into wind generation opportunities. In addition, current and potential new project developments can be negatively affected by a lower ALLETE stock price, which may result in such projects not being accretive, or otherwise unable to satisfy our financial objectives criteria to proceed. Additionally, tax law changes may adversely impact the economic characteristics of potential acquisitions or investments. Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy or the imposition of additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development or financing of new renewable energy projects and reduced project returns on future projects. If the Company is unable to execute its strategy of growth through acquisitions, project development for others, or the addition of new customers and geographies, it may impede our long-term objectives and business strategy.\nAcquisitions are subject to uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage future acquisitions or strategic investments, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our actual results may also differ from our expectations due to factors such as the ability to obtain timely regulatory or governmental approvals, integration and operational issues and the ability to retain management and other key personnel.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks (Continued)\nThe generation of electricity from wind and solar energy facilities depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions.\nAlthough our electric generation facilities are located in diverse geographic regions to reduce the potential impact that may be caused by unfavorable weather in a particular region, suitable meteorological conditions are variable and difficult to predict. If wind or solar conditions are unfavorable or meteorological conditions are unsuitable, electricity generation and revenue from wind and solar energy facilities may be substantially below our expectations. The electricity produced, production tax credits received, and revenues generated by a wind or solar energy facility are highly dependent on suitable wind conditions and associated weather conditions, which are variable and beyond our control. We base our decisions about which wind and solar projects to build or acquire as well as our electricity generation estimates, in part, on the findings of long-term wind and other meteorological studies conducted on the project site and its region; however, the unpredictable nature of wind and solar conditions, weather and meteorological conditions can result in material deviations from these studies and our expectations. Furthermore, components of our systems could be damaged by severe weather, such as hailstorms, lightning or tornadoes. In addition, replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable. Unfavorable wind and solar conditions, weather or changes to meteorological patterns could impair the effectiveness of our electric generation facility assets, reduce their output beneath their rated capacity or require shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of our wind energy facilities or lead to an impairment of assets.\nThe construction, operation and maintenance of our electric generation facilities or investment in facilities are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe construction and operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including the performance by key contracted suppliers and maintenance providers; increases in the costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services; start-up operations risks; breakdown or failure of facilities; curtailment of facilities by counterparties; the dependence on the availability of wind resources; or the impact of unusual, adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Some of our facilities contain older generating equipment, which even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to continue operating at peak efficiency. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce and deliver power, including failure caused by breakdown or forced outage, as well as the repair of damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events.\nThe price of electricity may be volatile, which may impact results of operations at ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities under contracts with customer and industrial (C&I) customers.\nUnusual, adverse weather conditions or other natural events can cause volatility in market prices for electricity and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ALLETE Clean Energy\u2019s power sales agreements with its three C&I customers at its Diamond Spring wind energy facility are contracts for differences where power is delivered to the market, and a fixed price is paid by the customers to ALLETE Clean Energy, and differences between the market price and the fixed price are paid to or received from the customers. One of these power sales agreements settles with the customer based on day-ahead electricity prices, while deliveries to the market are settled based on real-time electricity prices. This settlement provision can and has resulted in an adverse impact to the Company when market prices are extremely volatile as happened in February 2021 during an extreme winter weather event in the southwest United States. This winter weather event caused extreme volatility, with large differences in the day-ahead and real-time market prices; the settlement provision resulted in an approximately $5 million after-tax negative impact related to the Diamond Spring wind energy facility in 2021.\nAs contracts with counterparties expire, we may not be able to replace them with agreements on similar terms or divest the related assets at a profit.\nALLETE Clean Energy is party to PSAs which expire in various years between 2022 and 2039. These PSA expirations are prior to the end of the estimated useful lives of the respective wind energy facilities. If, for any reason, ALLETE Clean Energy is unable to enter into new agreements with existing or new counterparties on similar terms once the current agreements expire, sell energy in the wholesale market resulting in similar revenue, or enter into a contract to sell the facility at a profit, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected, which includes potential impairment of property, plant and equipment.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks (Continued)\nCounterparties to turbine and other generation supply, service and maintenance, or power sale agreements may not fulfill their obligations.\nOur businesses are party to turbine and other generation supply agreements, service and maintenance agreements, and PSAs under various durations with a limited number of creditworthy counterparties. If, for any reason, any of the counterparties under these agreements do not fulfill their related contractual obligations, and we are unable to mitigate non-performance by a key supplier or maintenance provider or remarket PSA energy resulting in similar revenue, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nBNI Energy may be adversely impacted by its exposure to customer concentration, and environmental laws and regulations.\nBNI Energy sells lignite coal to two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, and could be adversely impacted if these customers were unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations, or change the way in which they operate their generating facilities. In addition, BNI Energy and its customers may be adversely impacted by existing or new environmental laws and regulations which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, insurance companies have decreased the available coverage for policy holders in the mining industry, impacting the availability of coverage, and leading to higher deductibles and premiums.\nReal estate market conditions where our legacy Florida real estate investment is located may deteriorate.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy related to the real estate assets of ALLETE Properties incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of its entire portfolio, in addition to sales over time, however, adverse market conditions could impact the timing of land sales, which could result in little to no sales, while still incurring operating expenses such as community development district assessments and property taxes, resulting in net operating losses at ALLETE Properties. Furthermore, weak market conditions could put the properties at risk for an impairment charge. An impairment charge would result in a non-cash charge to earnings that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEntity-wide Risks\nWe could be materially adversely affected by health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and on our employees, customers, contractors, and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the length of time for which COVID-19 will continue, if new variants will emerge or the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus. We are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its transmission and have implemented company-wide business continuity plans in response to the pandemic. These plans guide our emergency response, business continuity, and the precautionary measures we are taking on behalf of employees and the public. We have taken additional precautions for our employees who work in the field and for employees who continue to work in our facilities, and we have implemented work from home policies where appropriate. We continue to implement physical and cyber-security measures to ensure that our systems remain functional in order to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and keep them running to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related federal and state government responses has led to a disruption of economic activity, and could result in an extended disruption of economic activity. Further disruption of economic activity or an extended disruption of economic activity may lead to additional adverse impacts on our taconite, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, and pipeline customers\u2019 operations including reduced production or the temporary idling or indefinite shutdown of facilities, which would result in lower sales and revenue from these customers.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nThe Company is monitoring the capital markets and has access to liquidity to enable us to operate our businesses and fund capital projects; however, a disruption in capital markets could lead to increased borrowing costs or adversely impact our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources. If we are not able to access capital on acceptable terms in sufficient amounts and when needed, or at all, the ability to maintain our businesses or to implement our business plans would be adversely affected. In addition, the performance of capital markets impacts the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of these assets would increase the funding requirements under our benefit plans and future costs recognized for the benefit plans if the asset market values do not recover. The Company is also monitoring supply chains for key materials, supplies, labor and services for our operations and large capital projects. The pandemic could result in a disruption to our supply chains which could adversely impact our operations and capital projects. There has been some impact on our supply chains as to the availability of and price for materials, supplies and services to date. In addition, disruptions in our supply chains or a lack of available financing could jeopardize our ability to complete certain capital projects in time to qualify them for production tax credits.\nWe will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, operations and customers, and we will take additional precautions that we determine are necessary in order to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of this pandemic as well as governmental and third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether it will have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on access to financing sources and capital markets. If we do not have access to capital on acceptable terms or are unable to obtain capital when needed, our ability to execute our business plans, make capital expenditures or pursue other strategic actions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on access to financing sources and the capital markets, on acceptable terms and at reasonable costs, as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flows from operations. Market disruptions or a downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access and finance in the capital markets or to access other financing sources such as tax equity financing. Such disruptions or causes of a downgrade could include but are not limited to: weakening of the Company\u2019s cash flow metrics; a loss of, or a reduction in sales to, our taconite, paper and pipeline customers if we are unable to offset the related lost margins; weaker operating performance; adverse regulatory outcomes; disproportionate increase in the contribution to net income from ALLETE Clean Energy and our Corporate and Other businesses as compared to that from our Regulated Operations; deteriorating economic or capital market conditions; or volatility in commodity prices.\nIf we are not able to access capital on acceptable terms in sufficient amounts and when needed, or at all, the ability to maintain our businesses or to implement our business plans would be adversely affected.\nA deterioration in general economic conditions, an inflationary environment or supply chain disruptions may have adverse impacts on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, we experience an inflationary environment or supply chains are disrupted on a national or regional level, it may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as on our customers. This impact may include volatility and unpredictability in the demand for the products and services offered by our businesses, the loss of existing customers, tempered growth strategies, customer production cutbacks, customer bankruptcies and increases in costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services for our operations and capital projects. An uncertain economy could also adversely affect expenses including pension costs, interest costs, and uncollectible accounts, or lead to reductions in the value of certain real estate and other investments.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to extensive state and federal legislation and regulation, compliance with which could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to, and affected by, extensive state and federal legislation and regulation. If it was determined that our businesses failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or be required to implement additional compliance measures or actions, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal and state agencies, or changes to or a failure to comply with current laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and their interpretations, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills, could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe success of our business heavily depends on the leadership of our executive officers and key employees to implement our business strategy. The inability to maintain a qualified workforce including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills, may negatively affect our ability to service our existing or new customers, or successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Personnel costs may increase due to competitive pressures, inflation or terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees.\nMarket performance and other changes could decrease the value of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, which may result in significant additional funding requirements and increased annual expenses.\nThe performance of the capital markets impacts the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations to these plans and the trusts hold significant assets. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets would increase the funding requirements under our benefit plans if asset returns do not recover. Additionally, our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs are generally recoverable in our electric rates as allowed by our regulators or through our cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements at BNI Energy; however, there is no certainty that regulators will continue to allow recovery of these rising costs in the future.\nWe are exposed to significant reputational risk.\nThe Company could suffer negative impacts to its reputation as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate compliance policies, regulatory violations, or other events which may result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other catastrophic events, such as natural disasters and acts of war.\nCatastrophic events at or near Company facilities and equipment on which the Company depends upon or that otherwise impact the Company such as fires, wildfires, including the impact to Company facilities and operations or potential liability if caused by Company equipment, earthquakes, explosions, and floods, severe weather, such as ice storms, hailstorms, or tornadoes or similar occurrences, as well as acts of war, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s facilities, operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although the Company has contingency plans and employs crisis management to respond and recover operations in the event of a severe disruption resulting from a catastrophic event, these measures may not be successful. Furthermore, despite these measures, if a catastrophic event were to occur, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nThe scientific community generally accepts that emissions of GHG are linked to global climate change. Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent, longer duration or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs or limit the availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services. An extreme weather event can also directly affect our capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to facility outages, downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment.\nClimate-related risks that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations include effects of environmental- or economic-based laws, regulations, incentives or initiatives designed to reduce the quantity or impact of GHG emissions. This includes the risk of laws or regulations that create mandates that do not allow for a transition that protects the safety, reliability or affordability of energy for our customers, are implemented before cost-effective technology is developed and regulatory policy is established, or require the electric sector to decarbonize faster than other sectors and ahead of our current goal to deliver 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050. Additionally, restrictions on land use, wildlife impacts, and other environmental regulations could affect the siting, construction and operation of new or existing generation and transmission facilities needed to transition to lower-carbon generation sources.\nThese all have the potential to adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are vulnerable to acts of terrorism or cybersecurity attacks.\nOur operations may be targets of terrorist activities or cybersecurity attacks, which could disrupt our ability to provide utility service at our regulated utilities, develop or operate our renewable energy projects at ALLETE Clean Energy, or operate our other businesses. The impacts may also impair the fulfillment of critical business functions, negatively impact our reputation, subject us to litigation or increased regulation, or compromise sensitive, confidential and other data.\nThere have been cybersecurity attacks on U.S. energy infrastructure in the past and there may be such attacks in the future. Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely affected by such activities. Hacking, computer viruses, terrorism, theft and sabotage could impact our systems and facilities, or those of third parties on which we rely, which may disrupt our operations.\nOur businesses require the continued operation of sophisticated custom-developed, purchased, and leased information technology systems and network infrastructure as well as the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Although we maintain security measures designed to prevent cybersecurity incidents and protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets, our technology systems, or those of third parties on which we rely, may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism as well as other causes. If those technology systems fail or are breached and not recovered in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform critical business functions including effectively maintaining certain internal controls over financial reporting, our reputation may be negatively impacted, we may become subject to litigation or increased regulation, and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised. If our business were impacted by terrorist activities or cybersecurity attacks, such impacts could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties we face.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties we face. The occurrence of these risks and uncertainties, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nGovernment challenges to our tax positions, as well as tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of our operations and business decisions, could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. The obligations, which include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes, involve complex matters that ultimately could be litigated. We also estimate our ability to use tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards and tax credits that are recorded as deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A disallowance of some or all of these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are currently utilizing, and plan to utilize in the future, our carryforwards and tax credits to reduce our income tax obligations. If we cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of our carryforwards and tax credits before they expire, we may incur adverse charges to earnings.\nIf federal or state tax authorities deny any deductions or tax credits, negatively change existing tax laws or policies, or fail to extend or renew policies beneficial to the Company, such as those for renewable energy production tax credits, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 24248, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "ALE"}
