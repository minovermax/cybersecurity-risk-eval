{"cik": "1059262", "company": "SP Plus Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part IV, Item 15. \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\" of this Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Company's actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nWe are subject to intense competition that could constrain our ability to gain business and adversely impact our profitability.\nCompetition is intense in the parking facility management, valet, ground transportation services, event management and baggage delivery businesses including other ancillary services that we offer. Providers of similar services have traditionally competed on the basis of cost and quality of service. As we have worked to establish ourselves as a leader of the industry, we compete predominately on the basis of high levels of service and strong relationships. We may not be able to, or may choose not to compete with certain competitors on the basis of price. As a result, a greater proportion of our clients may switch to other service providers or elect to self-manage the services we provide.\nThe low cost of entry into these businesses has led to strongly competitive, fragmented markets consisting of various sized entities, ranging from small local or single lot operators to large regional and national businesses and multi-facility operators, as well as governmental entities and companies that can perform themselves, one or more of the services we provide. Regional and local-owned and operated companies may have additional insights into local or smaller markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with a competitive advantage in those regards. Competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services or develop technology that is as or more successful than our technology.\nWe provide nearly all of our services under contracts, many of which are obtained through competitive bidding, and many of our contracts require that our clients pay certain costs at specified rates. Our management type contracts are typically for a term of one to three years, although the contracts may be terminated by the client, without cause, on 30-days' notice or less, giving clients regular opportunities to attempt to negotiate a reduction in fees or other allocated costs. Any loss of a significant number of clients could in the aggregate materially adversely affect our operating results. We may experience higher operating costs related to changes in laws and regulations regarding employee benefits, employee minimum wage, and other entitlements promulgated by federal, state and local governments or as a result of increased local wages necessary to attract employees due to changes in the unemployment rate. If actual costs exceed the rates specified in the contacts or we are unable to renegotiate our specified rates in our contracts, our profitability may be negatively affected. Furthermore, these strong competitive pressures could impede our success in bidding for profitable business and our ability to maintain or increase prices even as costs rise, thereby reducing margins.\nChanging consumer preferences and legislation may lead to a decline in parking demand, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRide sharing services such as Uber and Lyft and car sharing services like Zipcar, along with the potential for driverless cars, may lead to a decline in parking demand in cities and urban areas. While we devote considerable effort and resources to analyzing and responding to consumer preference and changes in the markets in which we operate, consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. Changes in consumer behaviors by using mobile phone applications and on-line parking reservation services that help drivers reserve parking with garage, lots and individual owner spaces cannot be predicted with certainty and could change current customers' parking preferences which may have an impact on the price customers are willing to pay. Additionally, urban congestion and congestion pricing due to the aforementioned ride sharing services, or state and local laws that have been or may be passed encouraging carpooling and use of mass transit systems, may negatively impact parking demand and pricing that a customer would be willing to pay. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the consumer marketplace and the industry, including, but not limited to, market displacement by livery service companies, car sharing companies and changing technologies, it could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage the use of carpooling and mass transit. In the future, local, state and federal environmental regulatory authorities may pursue or continue to pursue, measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions which may have the effect of decreasing the number of cars being driven. Such laws or regulations could adversely impact the demand for our services and ultimately our business.\nOur business success depends on our ability to preserve client relationships.\nWe primarily provide services pursuant to agreements that are cancelable by either party upon 30-days\u2019 notice. As we generally incur initial costs on new contracts, our business associated with long-term client relationships is generally more profitable than short-term client relationships. Managing our existing client relationships, including those client relationships acquired as part of a business acquisition, is an important factor in contributing to our business success. If we lose a significant number of existing clients, or fail to win new clients, our profitability could be negatively impacted, even if we gain equivalent revenues from new clients or through client relationships acquired by acquisition.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining coverage for certain insurable risks or coverage for certain insurable risks at a reasonable cost.\nWe use a combination of insured and self-insured programs to cover workers' compensation, general/garage liability, automobile liability, property damage, healthcare and other insurable risks and we provide liability and workers' compensation insurance coverage, consistent with our obligations to our clients under our various contracts. We are responsible for claims in excess of our insurance policies' limits, and while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims or direct or consequential damages. If our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable our business may be negatively affected.\nRecent consolidation within the insurance industry could impact our ability to obtain or renew policies at competitive rates. Should we be unable to obtain or renew our excess, umbrella, or other commercial insurance policies at competitive rates, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, as would the occurrence of catastrophic uninsured claims or the inability or refusal of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise insured claims.\nWe are subject to volatility associated with our high deductible and high retention insurance programs, including the possibility that changes in estimates of ultimate insurance losses could result in material charges against our operating results.\nWe are obligated to reimburse our insurance carriers for, or pay directly, each loss incurred up to the amount of a specified deductible or self-insured retention amount. We also purchase property insurance that provides coverage for loss or damage to our property and, in some cases, our clients' property, as well as business interruption coverage for lost operating income and certain associated expenses. The deductible or retention applicable to any given loss under the property insurance policies varies based upon the insured values and the peril that causes the loss. Our financial statements reflect our funding of all such obligations based upon guidance and evaluation received from third-party insurance professionals. There can be no assurance, however, that our actual obligations will not exceed the amount presently funded or accrued, in which case we would need to set aside additional funds to reserve for any such excess.\nThe determination of required insurance reserves is dependent upon significant actuarial judgments. We use the results of actuarial studies to estimate insurance rates and reserves for future periods and adjust reserves as appropriate for the current year and prior years. Changes in insurance reserves as a result of periodic evaluations of the liabilities can cause swings in operating results that may not be indicative of the performance of our ongoing business. Actual experience related to our insurance reserves can cause us to change our estimates for reserves, and any such changes may materially impact our results of operations, causing volatility in our operating results. Additionally, our obligations could increase if we receive a greater number of insurance claims, or if the severity of, or the administrative costs associated with, those claims generally increases.\nFurther, to the extent that we self-insure our losses, deterioration in our loss control and/or our continuing claim management efforts could increase the overall costs of claims within our retained limits. A material change in our insurance costs due to changes in the frequency of claims, the severity of claims, the costs of excess/umbrella premiums, regulatory changes, or consolidation within the insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nBecause of the size of the operations covered and our claims experience, we purchase insurance policies at prices that we believe represent a discount to the prices that would typically be charged to clients on a stand-alone basis. The clients for whom we provide professional services pursuant to management type contracts have the option of purchasing their own liability insurance policies (provided that we are named as an additional insured party). Historically, most of our clients have chosen to obtain insurance coverage by being named as additional insureds under our master liability insurance policies. Pursuant to our management type contracts, we charge those clients an allocated portion of our insurance-related costs. Our inability to purchase such policies at competitive rates or charge clients for such insurance-related costs, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe do not maintain insurance coverage for all possible risks.\nWe maintain a comprehensive portfolio of insurance policies to help protect us against loss or damage incurred from a wide variety of insurable risks. Each year, we review with our third party insurance advisers whether the insurance policies and associated coverages that we maintain are sufficient to adequately protect us from the various types of risk to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business. That analysis takes into account various pertinent factors such as the likelihood that we would incur a material loss from any given risk, as well as the cost of obtaining insurance coverage against any such risk. We are responsible for claims in excess of our insurance policies' limits, and while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims or direct or consequential\ndamages. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not sustain material losses resulting from an event or occurrence where our insurance coverage is believed to be sufficient, but such coverage is either inadequate or we cannot access the coverage. Either of these scenarios may result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of allowing us to reduce our insurance costs.\nWe attempt to mitigate our business and operating risks through the implementation of Company-wide safety and loss control programs designed to decrease the incidence of accidents or events that might increase our exposure or liability. However, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage may be inadequate despite the implementation of Company-wide safety and loss control efforts or may not be accessible in certain instances any of which would result in additional costs to us and may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nIn the normal course of business, we are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these and any other legal proceedings cannot be predicted. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters could cause us to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations. Any significant adverse litigation, judgments or settlements could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because our business employs a significant number of employees, we incur risks that these individuals will make claims against us for violating various employment-related federal, state and local laws. Some or all of these claims may lead to litigation, including class action litigation, and there may be negative publicity with respect to any alleged claims. Additionally, we are subject to risks in the states where we have employees, including, for example, if there are new or unanticipated judicial interpretations of existing laws and of those interpretations are applied to employers on a retroactive basis.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our compliance with laws and regulations, including any changes thereto, or our non-compliance with such laws and regulations, may impose significant costs on us.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, current or previous owners or operators of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in their properties. This applies to properties we either own or operate. These laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. We may be potentially liable for such costs as a result of our operation of parking facilities. Additionally, we hold a partial ownership interest in four parking facilities, and companies that we acquired in previous years may have owned a large number of properties that we did not acquire. We may now be liable for certain costs as a result of such previous and current ownership. In addition, from time to time we are subject to legal claims and regulatory actions involving environmental issues at certain locations or in connection with our operations. The cost of defending against claims of liability, or remediation of a contaminated property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with ground transportation services and certain transportation and baggage services provided to our clients, including shuttle bus operations, baggage handling and delivery services and remote airline check-in services, the U.S. Department of Transportation, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Department of Homeland Security, and various federal and state agencies exercise broad powers over these transportation and baggage related services, including, licensing and authorizations, safety, training and insurance requirements. Our employees must also comply with the various safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other federal agencies, including those related to minimum training hours and requirements, drug and alcohol testing and service hours. We may become subject to new and more restrictive federal and state regulations. Compliance with such regulations could hamper our ability to provide qualified drivers and increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance that our compliance with new rules and regulations, directives, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are also subject to consumer credit laws and credit card industry rules and regulations relating to the processing of credit card transactions, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Payment Card Data Security Standard. These laws and these industry standards impose substantial financial penalties for non-compliance.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws generally applicable to businesses, including, but not limited, to federal, state and local regulations relating to data privacy, wage and hour matters, employee classification, mandatory healthcare benefits, unlawful workplace discrimination and whistle blowing. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with any regulation applicable to our business or any whistle-blowing claim, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation, regulatory action or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe collect and remit sales/parking taxes and file tax returns for and on behalf of ourselves and our clients. We are affected by laws and regulations that may impose a direct assessment on us for failure to remit sales/parking taxes and filing of tax returns for ourselves and on behalf of our clients.\nWe cannot predict changes in laws and regulations made by the U.S. President, the U.S. President's administration, or the current and future U.S. Congress. Any such changes may pose additional regulatory burden and costs on our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn the past, a significant portion of our growth has been generated by acquisitions, and we expect to continue to acquire businesses in the future as part of our growth strategy. A slowdown in the pace or size of our acquisitions could lead to a slower growth rate. There can be no assurance that any acquisition we make, including Bags, will provide us with any of the benefits that we anticipated or anticipate when entering into a transaction, particularly acquisitions in adjacent professional services. The process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses. The areas in which we may face risks in connection with any potential acquisition of a business include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business to perform in-line with management expectations or acquisition models;\n\u2022\nrevenue synergies and our ability to cross-sell service offerings to existing clients may be different than management's expectations;\n\u2022\ncosts of integrating the business or synergies anticipated could be different than management's expectations;\n\u2022\nmanagement time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to acquisition integration;\n\u2022\nthe time frame for integration could be delayed and the related costs may exceed management's expectations;\n\u2022\nclients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively impact our ability to grow that acquired business;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired business\u2019s accounting, information technology, human resources, and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense reduction;\n\u2022\nan acquired entity may not have in place all the necessary controls as required by the SEC and the Public Accounting Oversight Board, and implementing such controls, procedures, and policies may fail;\n\u2022\nintegrating financial reporting policies in compliance with the SEC's requirements and the requirements of other regulatory bodies may result in increased costs, time and resources spent on or by our financial personnel;\n\u2022\nintegrating an acquired entity into our internal control over financial reporting may require and continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs;\n\u2022\nadditional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to additional compliance and other regulatory requirements as a result of the acquired business as a result of any new products or services we offer; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated or unknown liabilities may arise relating to the acquired business.\nOur management type contracts and lease type contracts expose us to certain risks.\nThe loss or renewal on less favorable terms of a substantial number of management type contracts or lease type contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A material reduction in the operating income associated with the integrated services we provide under management type contracts and lease type contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our management type contracts are typically for a term of one to three years, although the contracts may be terminated, without cause, on 30-days' notice or less, giving clients regular opportunities to attempt to negotiate a reduction in fees or other allocated costs. Any loss of a significant number of clients could in the aggregate materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are particularly exposed to increases in costs for locations that we operate under lease type contracts because we are generally responsible for all the operating expenses of our leased locations. During the first and fourth quarters of each year, seasonality generally impacts our performance with regard to moderating revenues, with the reduced levels of travel most clearly reflected in the parking activity associated with our airport and hotel businesses as well as increases in certain costs of parking services, such as snow removal, all of which negatively affects gross profit.\nDeterioration in economic conditions in general could reduce the demand for our services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAdverse changes in global, national and local economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business. Adverse economic conditions may result in client's customers reducing their discretionary spending, which includes travel and leisure spending. Because a portion of our revenue is tied to the volume of airline passengers, hotel guests, retail shoppers and sports event attendees, our business could be adversely impacted by the curtailment of business travel, personal travel or discretionary spending caused by unfavorable changes in economic conditions and/or consumer confidence. Adverse changes in local, regional, national and international economic conditions could depress prices for our services or cause clients to cancel agreements for the services we provide to our clients and their customers.\nIn addition, our business operations tend to be concentrated in large urban areas. Many of our customers are workers who commute by car to their places of employment in these urban centers or who use services in the travel and leisure industry. Our business could be materially adversely affected to the extent that weak economic conditions or demographic factors could result in the elimination of jobs and high unemployment in the large urban areas where our business operations are concentrated. In addition, increased unemployment levels, the movement of white-collar jobs from urban centers to suburbs or out of North America entirely, increased office vacancies in urban areas, movement toward home office alternatives or lower consumer spending could reduce consumer demand for our services.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber-attacks, cyber-terrorism and security breaches to our technology, or our third-party providers and clients, or the compromise of our data, present risks that could harm our business.\nWe are increasingly centralized and dependent on automated information technology systems to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities. In addition, a portion of our business operations is conducted electronically, increasing the risk of attack or interception that could cause loss or misuse of data, system failures, disruption of operations, unauthorized malware, computer or system viruses, or the compromise of data, such as theft of intellectual property or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or personal information.\nFurthermore, while we continue to devote significant resources to monitoring and updating our systems and implementing information security measures to protect our systems, there can be no assurance that any controls or procedures that we have in place will be sufficient to protect us from security breaches. Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events or developments may result in a future compromise or breach of our networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until they have been deployed against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.\nAdditionally, our systems could be subject to damage or interruption from system conversions, power outages, computer or telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attack, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial repair and/or replacement costs, experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage customer transactions, which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations. The occurrence of acts of cyber terrorism, such as website defacement, denial of automated payment services, sabotage of our proprietary on-demand technology or the use of electronic social media to disseminate unfounded or otherwise harmful allegations to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any disruptions to our information technology systems, breaches or compromise of data and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, negative publicity, litigation, violation of privacy laws or business interruptions or damage to our reputation that, in turn, could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses potentially incurred and would not remedy any damage to our reputation.\nWe do not have control over security measures taken by third-party vendors hired by our clients to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information. There can be no assurance that other third-party payment processing vendors will not suffer a similar attack in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal financial information of individuals associated with our company, our clients or our client's customers, or that any such incident will be discovered and remedied in a timely manner.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) could affect interest rates under our existing credit facility agreement, hedging activity, as well as our ability to seek future debt financing.\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We generally use LIBOR as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our Senior Credit Facility and to establish the floor and ceiling ranges for the interest rate collar contracts that we entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with the Senior Credit Facility.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Regulators in various jurisdictions have been working to replace LIBOR and other interbank offered rates with reference interest rates that are more firmly based on actual transactions. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) that is calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") added the Overnight Index Swap Rate based on the SOFR to the list of U.S. benchmark interest rates eligible to be hedged under US GAAP and has issued a proposal for consideration that would help facilitate the market transition from existing reference interest rates to alternatives.\nIt is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. If a published LIBOR is unavailable after 2021, the interest rates under our Senior Credit Facility will be determined using various alternative methods, any of which may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. In addition, the transition process to an alternative method may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity\nin markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR and may also result in reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as our interest rate collars and any other hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. Any such effects of the transition away from LIBOR, as well as other unforeseen effects, may result in expenses, difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur indebtedness in the future, that could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur Senior Credit Facility provides for a senior secured $325.0 million revolving credit facility and a $225.0 million term loan that is scheduled to mature in November 2023. The facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets. Failure to comply with covenants or to meet payment obligations under our Senior Credit Facility could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause the related risks to intensify. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before their respective maturities. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including indebtedness under our Senior Credit Facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt, we may default under the terms of our indebtedness, which could lead to an acceleration of debt repayment. We do not expect that we could repay all of our outstanding indebtedness if the repayment of such indebtedness was accelerated. If adequate capital is not available to us and our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, or if future financings require more restrictive covenants, such combination of events could adversely affect our ability to (i) acquire new businesses or enter new markets, (ii) service or refinance our existing debt, (iii) make necessary capital investments and (iv) make other expenditures necessary for the ongoing conduct of our business.\nOur ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital.\nThe rate of our expansion will depend in part on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend, in large part, on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt capital. In addition, our credit facility (the \"Senior Credit Facility\") contains provisions that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and/or make substantial investments or acquisitions. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will have the ability to obtain adequate capital to expand our business.\nThe financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect our results.\nFuture revenue and our ability to collect accounts receivable depend, in part, on the financial strength of our clients. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts, and this allowance adversely impacts profitability. In the event that our clients experience financial difficulty, become unable to obtain financing or seek bankruptcy protection, our profitability would be further impacted by our failure to collect accounts receivable in excess of the estimated allowance. Additionally, our future revenue would be reduced by the loss of these clients or by the cancellation of lease type contracts or management type contracts by clients in bankruptcy.\nLabor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations.\nWhen one or more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation or we face union organizing drives, we may disagree with the union on important issues that, in turn, could lead to a strike, work slowdown or other job actions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms. In such cases, there are no assurances that we would be able to staff sufficient employees for our short-term needs. A strike, work slowdown or other job action could in some cases disrupt us from providing services, resulting in reduced revenues. If declines in client service occur or if our clients are targeted for sympathy strikes by other unionized workers, contract cancellations could result. The result of negotiating a first time agreement or renegotiating an existing collective bargaining agreement could result in a substantial increase in labor and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to clients. In addition, potential legislation could make it significantly easier for union organizing drives to be successful and could give third-party arbitrators the ability to impose terms of collective bargaining agreements upon us and a labor union if we are unable to agree with such union on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. At December 31, 2019, approximately 28% of our employees were represented by labor unions and approximately 38% of our collective bargaining contracts are up for renewal in 2020, representing approximately 26% of our employees. In addition, at any given time, we may face a number of union organizing drives. When one or more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation or when we face union organizing drives, we and the union may disagree on important issues that could lead employees to strike, work slowdown, or other job actions. In a market where we are unionized but our competitors are not unionized, we may lose clients as a result. A strike, work slowdown, or other job actions could disrupt our ability to provide services to our clients, resulting in reduced revenues or contract cancellations. Moreover, negotiating first-time collective bargaining agreements or renewing existing agreements, could result in substantial increases in labor and benefit costs that we may not be able to pass through to clients.\nIn addition, we make contributions to multi-employer benefit plans on behalf of certain employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we could be responsible for paying unfunded liabilities incurred by such benefit plans, which amount could be material.\nOur business success depends on retaining senior management and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur future performance depends on the continuing services and contributions of our senior management to execute on our acquisition and growth strategies and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Our future success also depends, in large part, on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Any unplanned turnover in senior management or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including changes in immigration policy, regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and competition we face from other companies to attract and retain qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather conditions, including natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks or acts of terrorism could disrupt our business and services.\nWeather conditions, including fluctuations in temperatures, hurricanes, snow or severe weather storms, earthquakes, drought, heavy flooding, mud slides, large scale forest fires, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks such as the coronavirus, or acts of terrorism may cause economic dislocations throughout the country, lead to reduced levels of travel and result in an increase in certain costs of providing parking and remote bag check-in and handling services, any of which could negatively affect gross profit. In addition, terrorist attacks have resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased government regulation of airlines and airport facilities, including the imposition of minimum distances between parking facilities and terminals, resulting in the elimination of parking facilities we manage. We derive a significant percentage of our gross profit from parking facilities and parking related services in and around airports. The FAA generally prohibits parking within 300 feet of airport terminals during periods of heightened security. While the prohibition is not currently in effect, there can be no assurance that this governmental prohibition will not be reinstated again in the future. The existing regulations governing parking within 300 feet of airport terminals or future regulations may prevent us from using certain parking spaces. Reductions in the number of parking spaces and air travelers may reduce our revenue and cash flow from both our leased facilities and those facilities and contracts we operate under management type contracts.\nBecause our business is affected by weather-related trends, typically in the first and fourth quarters of each year, our results may fluctuate from period to period, which could make it difficult to evaluate our business.\nWeather conditions, including fluctuations in temperatures, snow or severe weather storms, heavy flooding, hurricanes or natural disasters, can negatively impact portions of our business. We periodically have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results arising from a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nreduced levels of travel during and as a result of severe weather conditions, which is reflected in lower revenue from our services; and\n\u2022\nincreased cost of services, such as snow removal and longer delivery times for our baggage delivery services.\nThese factors have typically had negative impacts to our gross profit and could cause gross profit reductions in the future. As a result of these seasonal affects, our revenue and earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters generally tend to be higher than revenue and earnings in the first quarter. Accordingly, you should not consider our first quarter results as indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year. Fluctuations in our results could make it difficult to evaluate our business or cause instability in the market price of our common stock.\nGoodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. October 1st is the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience a significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the use of acquired assets or our business strategy, and significant negative industry or economic trends. If the fair value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, we would record impairment for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value. The valuation of our reporting units requires significant judgment in evaluation of recent indicators of market activity and estimated future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors. Any impairment could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nImpairment of long-lived assets may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived asset or a change in its physical condition. When this occurs, a recoverability test is performed that compares the projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If we conclude that the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value. The amount of any impairment could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nState and municipal government clients may sell or enter into long-term lease type contracts of parking-related assets with our competitors or property owners and developers may redevelop existing locations for alternative uses.\nIn order to raise additional revenue, a number of state and municipal governments have either sold or entered into long-term lease type contracts of public assets or may be contemplating such transactions. The assets that are the subject of such transactions have included government-owned parking garages located in downtown commercial districts and parking operations at airports. The sale or long-term leasing of such government-owned parking assets to our competitors or clients of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, property owners and developers may elect to redevelop existing locations for alternative uses other than parking or significantly reduce the number of existing spaces used for parking at those facilities in which we either lease through a lease type contract or operate through a management type contract. Reductions in the number of parking spaces or potential loss of contracts due to redevelopment by property owners may reduce our gross profit and cash flow for both our lease type contracts and those facilities or contracts we operate under management type contracts.\nThe sureties for our performance bond program may elect not to provide us with new or renewal performance bonds for any reason.\nAs is customary in the industry, a surety provider can refuse to provide a bond principal with new or renewal surety bonds. If any existing or future surety provider refuses to provide us with surety bonds, either generally or because we are unwilling or unable to post collateral at levels sufficient to satisfy the surety's requirements, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find alternate providers on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to provide surety bonds could also result in the loss of existing contracts. Failure to find a provider of surety bonds, and our resulting inability to bid for new contracts or renew existing contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFederal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe provide health care and other benefits to employees. In certain circumstances, we charge our clients insurance-related costs. Costs for health care have increased more rapidly than the general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care continues and we are unable to raise the rates we charge our clients to cover expenses incurred due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or other healthcare initiatives, our operating profit could be negatively impacted.\nChanges in tax laws or rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to income and non-income tax laws in the United States (federal, state and local) and other foreign jurisdictions, which include Canada and Puerto Rico. Changes in tax laws, regulations, tax rulings, administrative practices or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our business. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, and the effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including the United States (federal, state and local), Canada and Puerto Rico. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, entry into new businesses or geographies, changes to our existing business and operations, acquisitions and investments and how they are financed and changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws regulation, administrative practices, principles and interpretations. Additionally, adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations or changes in tax law, as discussed above, could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets, which could materially affect our results of operations.\nWe are also subject to tax audits and examinations by governmental authorities in the United States (federal, state and local), Canada and Puerto Rico. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of such tax audits and examinations. Negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits or examinations or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our effective tax rate.\nWe have investments in joint ventures and may be subject to certain financial and operating risks with our joint venture investments.\nWe have acquired or invested in a number of joint ventures, and may acquire or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as:\n\u2022\nadditional operating losses and expenses in the businesses acquired or joint ventures in which we have made investments;\n\u2022\nthe dependence on the investee's accounting, financial reporting and similar systems, controls and processes of other entities whose financial performance is incorporated into our financial results due to our investment in that entity;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with a company we may acquire or in which we invest;\n\u2022\nrequirements or obligations to commit and provide additional capital, equity, or credit support as required by the joint venture agreements;\n\u2022\ninability of the joint venture partner to (1) perform its obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties or (2) provide additional capital, equity or credit support under the joint venture agreements; and\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on the business.\nAs a result of future acquisitions or joint ventures in which we may invest, we may need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions or investments in joint ventures could change rapidly given the global economic environment and climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments, resulting in other-than-temporary declines in fair value that could adversely impact our financial results.\nActions of activist investors could disrupt our business.\nPublic companies have been the target of activist investors. In the event that a third-party, such as an activist investor, proposes to change our governance policies, board of directors, or other aspects of our operations, our review and consideration of such proposals may create a significant distraction for our management and employees. This could negatively impact our ability to execute our long-term growth plan and may require our management to expend significant time and resources responding to such proposals. Such proposals may also create uncertainties with respect to our financial position and operations and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.", "PERMNO": 90194, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "SP"}
