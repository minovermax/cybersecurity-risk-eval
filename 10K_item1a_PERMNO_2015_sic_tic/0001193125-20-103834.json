{"cik": "8146", "company": "AstroNova, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. COVID-19 has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic\u201d and has spread to many of the countries in which we, our customers, our suppliers and our other business partners do business. National, state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Other organizations and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas and have had significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.\nWe continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 outbreak, including requiring most non-production related team members to work remotely. We have maintained a substantial portion of our manufacturing operational capacity at our manufacturing facilities located in West Warwick, Rhode Island, as well as our manufacturing facilities in Canada and Germany, at this time, and we have instituted heightened cleaning and sanitization standards and several health and safety protocols and procedures to safeguard our team members.\nHowever, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused the Company to experience a number of adverse impacts, including reductions in demand for its products, delays and cancellations of orders for its products, difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for its products, shortages of labor to manufacture products, inefficiencies caused by remote worker\u2019s difficulties in performing their normal work outputs, closures of the facilities of some of its suppliers and customers, and delays in collecting accounts receivable.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to estimate the entirety of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners, we expect that the continued spread of COVID-19, the measures taken by the governments of affected countries, actions taken to protect employees, and the impact of the pandemic on all business activities to further adversely impact our operational capacity and the efficiency of our team members and will materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may also adversely affect the Company if these impacts continue for a prolonged period and the Company needs additional liquidity.\nThe aerospace industry, which we serve through our aerospace product line, has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak, both inside and outside of the United States. The impact of the decline in air travel will likely have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results, the scope of which cannot be estimated at this time. Should one of more of our airplane OEM manufacturing customers or a significant number of airline customers fail to continue business as a going concern or declare bankruptcy, or otherwise reduce the demand for our products as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, it would have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\nAstroNova\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\nAny decline in our customers\u2019 markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, the current grounding and suspension of production of the Boeing 737 MAX has reduced demand for our airborne printers that are placed on that aircraft, as well as the related repairs and supplies, and that has negatively affected our results of operations. In addition, the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the airline industry as a whole, which could result in a reduction in orders by the airlines for new planes and reduce demand for retrofitting airplanes already in service and, therefore, a further reduction in demand for our airborne printer products. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future action relating to the 737 MAX on our business is currently unknown, but we expect any resulting changes in production schedules will likely have an adverse effect on our business, which could be material. Some of our customers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers may also limit consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers\u2019 markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.\nAstroNova\u2019s future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors\u2019 development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. AstroNova spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our data recorder products. Failure to meet our customers\u2019 changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.\nAs we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or AstroNova\u2019s plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAstroNova is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.\nWe subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nDisruptions in the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak;\n\u2022\nLimited control over the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nPotential absence of adequate production capacity;\n\u2022\nPotential delays in production lead times;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of certain process technologies; and\n\u2022\nReduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs.\nIf one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in required volumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor certain components, assembled products and supplies, AstroNova is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.\nAlthough we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, there has been and likely will continue to be disruption to our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations are disrupted. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAstroNova faces significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based on technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we\ncurrently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seek alternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nAstroNova\u2019s profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing certain internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nAstroNova\u2019s inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property, defend against assertions of infringement or lose certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to the Company\u2019s proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that the Company currently owns. The loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter and ToughSwitch or the loss of the licenses provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divert our management\u2019s focus away from operations.\nAstroNova has significant inventories on hand.\nWe maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, as well as prolonged reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products due to the COVID-19 outbreak, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect AstroNova\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers\noutside the U.S., accounted for 37% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nInterruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\n\u2022\nCustomer and vendor financial stability;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nChanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;\n\u2022\nTrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nNegative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;\n\u2022\nDiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nDiffering protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the current COVID-19 outbreak.\nBrexit\nThe U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020 and has entered a transition period until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. and the E.U. will seek to negotiate a trade deal, and the U.K. will remain in both the E.U. customs union and single market. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create further global economic uncertainty, which may adversely impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. countries and other nations. Brexit could subject us to disruptions in trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the UK, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and disruptions to our workforce and that of our suppliers and business partners.\nAstroNova could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.\nAstroNova has incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.\nIn addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes we employ, and may have unknown or undetected errors. Some types of errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause\nAstroNova to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs and may divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts which may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability.\nCertain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business.\nIn certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws, including the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.\nThe Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. federal corporate income tax law and includes a broad range of tax reform measures affecting business including among other things, the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the loss of certain business deductions, the acceleration of first-year expensing of certain capital expenditures and a one-time tax imposed on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching, and we continue to evaluate the actual impact of its enactment on the Company. Any material adverse impact resulting from the Tax Act that has not yet been identified could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries. On October 5, 2015, the OECD issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. Many of these recommendations or similar concepts are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the Tax Act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.\nChanges to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the Tax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period.\nIn addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. As of January 31, 2020, we did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nThe credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as amended, contains, and any future debt agreements may include, several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nIncur future indebtedness;\n\u2022\nPlace liens on assets;\n\u2022\nPay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 capital stock;\n\u2022\nRepurchase or acquire our capital stock;\n\u2022\nConduct mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nSell assets; and/or\n\u2022\nAlter our or our subsidiaries\u2019 capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.\nOur credit agreement with Bank of America also requires us to satisfy other requirements, including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and specifically because of the decline in revenue caused by the demand for aircraft cockpit printers for the 737 MAX, the anticipated decline in revenue due to the demand for aircraft due to the current COVID-19 pandemic driven decline in revenue passenger miles, as well as the likely decline in demand for some of our PI and other T&M products as a result of the COVID-19 driven slowdown in general economic activity. At this time, we expect that it is likely that we will violate the current terms of our credit agreement with Bank of America at the end of our first or second quarter of fiscal year 2021. While we expect to be able to renegotiate the terms of the credit agreement, if we are unable to do so or to secure alternative financing on acceptable terms, it will have a material adverse impact on us. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely\naffected. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us. To the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth, profitability and competitiveness of our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the agreement governing our credit facility permits us to elect to pay interest on our revolving line of credit based on LIBOR or a base rate as specified in the agreement. We also have term loans under our credit facility, as well as derivative instruments with variable interest rates, that are indexed to LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR (\u201cUSD-LIBOR\u201d) for use in debt instruments, derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on an industry wide and/or company specific transition from LIBOR to an alternative that will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates or financing costs to borrowers. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these changes cause the interest rates on our borrowings to increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAstroNova may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact AstroNova\u2019s overall business.\nWe have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:\n\u2022\nWe will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;\n\u2022\nAll the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;\n\u2022\nManagement\u2019s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;\n\u2022\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nDelays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nCustomer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and\n\u2022\nRespective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.\nIn certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.\nWe may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nEffectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\n\u2022\nIdentify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\n\u2022\nReduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.\nAll of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, AstroNova\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks.\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, we had approximately $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets such as those caused by the current COVID-19 outbreak may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position.\nTo date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counter parties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAstroNova could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe employ information technology systems to support our business. Any security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other confidential information. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. As a result, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstance our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAstroNova could experience risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming all our operations to one global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. The ERP system is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, improve the efficiency of how we accurately maintain our books and records and enhance the speed and quality of information provided to our management team for use in the operation and management of our business. The implementation of the ERP system will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we will experience delays and increased costs as factors such as limited on-site availability of Company personnel and outside consultants due to travel restrictions and remote work conditions, as well as a redirection of personnel efforts toward responding to the COVID-19 outbreak from the implementation of the new ERP system. Significant disruption in the implementation and transition to the new ERP system as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak could negatively impact our ability to obtain the benefits that the new ERP system is intended to bring. The length of these delays and the related cost are unknown because of the uncertainty of the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Additionally, any significant disruption or deficiency in the design, implementation and transition to the new ERP system could negatively impact our ability to:\n\u2022\nrecord and process orders,\n\u2022\nmanufacture and ship our products in a timely manner, and\n\u2022\nprocess data and electronic communications among our business locations,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also face the challenge of supporting our older systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise that impact our normal business operations and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flow.\nAstroNova depends on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, a number of key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues and the loss of any of these employees could harm the company\u2019s ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAstroNova is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.\nCertain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance.\nAs the result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have been required by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities and governmental authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our own desire to adhere to best health and safety practices, to implement a number of policies and procedures that have increased our costs and added complexity and inefficiency to our manufacturing operations and all administrative and office-based functions.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.\nUnauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.\nAstroNova collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 , which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect\non January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.\nAdditionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored within those jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the Company and its subsidiaries. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nWhile we continue to assess these requirements and the ways they may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codes of conduct.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. We monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider, whether as result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the 737 MAX grounding or otherwise, include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nInadequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee health care benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition.\nIn the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums.\nWe record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as of each balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances. It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of loss. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to record additional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe, that the liabilities we have recorded to date will be sufficient to provide for losses we may incur due to increased COVID-19 related employee health care insurance costs. However, the ultimate amount of these costs cannot be estimated at this time, and a prolonged period of spread of the disease could further increase our costs and liabilities, the impact of which may be material.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.\nCompliance with rules governing \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and our costs and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nSEC rules require disclosures regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determined that we use gold, tin and tantalum, each of which is considered a \u201cconflict mineral\u201d under the SEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required to conduct inquiries designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our products originated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that may be necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.", "PERMNO": 15537, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "ALOT"}
