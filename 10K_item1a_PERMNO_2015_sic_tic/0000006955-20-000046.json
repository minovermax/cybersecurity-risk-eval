{"cik": "6955", "company": "ENERPAC TOOL GROUP CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-10-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing the Company. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, including our ability to execute our strategic growth and profitability objectives.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nWe have been and continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its related impacts to our employees, operations, customers and suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience, reductions in both the demand for certain of our products and services and the ability of our global teams and suppliers to produce and deliver those products and services. As COVID-19 has spread, it has significantly impacted the health and economic environment around the world. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general economic conditions, and more damaging effects on certain markets, such as oil & gas, are having and will continue to have negative implications on demand for our products and services. During the latter half of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, we experienced significant reductions in the volume of sales compared to our prior-year level.\nWhile our supply chain has not been significantly impacted to date, we continue to develop new sources of supply and implement additional strategies to mitigate potential supply impacts of the pandemic. We cannot, however, ensure that the scope or duration of supply chain interruptions will not adversely impact our operations or that our mitigation strategies will continue to be sufficient or effective. To the extent the impacts on the supply chain have remained modest, in part due to our reduced purchasing levels, we could see greater impacts if the supply chain is not able to produce and ship goods commensurate with the timing and pace of our demand recovery. Therefore, uncertainties with respect to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, the terms of related governmental orders restricting activities globally, and the timing and pace of an economic recovery may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demand.\nIn addition, certain of our facilities and the facilities of our customers and suppliers may be prevented from conducting business activities, our customers may be prevented from purchasing our products, and we may be unable to purchase necessary materials from vendors due to localized COVID-19 outbreaks, shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders, import restrictions or other preventative measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Although our operations have generally been treated as \u201cessential\u201d operations under applicable government orders restricting business activities that have been issued to date, and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate, it is possible that they may not continue to be so treated under future government orders, or, even if so treated, site-specific health and safety concerns might otherwise require certain of our operations to be halted for some period of time. The operations of all our facilities have been affected in terms of employee protective measures, including social distancing and personal protection equipment measures. These measures will continue to affect the efficiency of our operations for the foreseeable future.\nOur results of operations may continue to be adversely affected in other areas of the world that may continue to experience COVID-19 outbreaks and that may be subject to governmental restrictions affecting business activities that impact the demand for our products and services or prevent us from fully operating in those jurisdictions. In addition, we may be unable to secure adequate supply of necessary components that are manufactured in areas that remain subject to governmental restrictions.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nDeterioration of, or instability in, the domestic and international economy and challenging end-market conditions could impact our ability to grow the business and adversely impact our ability to execute our strategy, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur businesses and operating results have been, and will continue to be, affected by domestic and international economic conditions. The level of demand for our products is affected by general economic and business conditions in our served end markets. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from customers in cyclical industries (such as the industrial and oil & gas sectors) that typically are adversely affected in periods of economic contraction or volatility. In such periods, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may reduce or delay our sales. We have experienced contraction and challenging demand conditions in many of our served markets, including the oil & gas and infrastructure markets. We have implemented certain restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our cost structure and improving operational performance in response to those market conditions. Further deterioration in market conditions could result in the Company implementing additional restructuring initiatives. Such initiatives could result in restructuring costs, including facility consolidations, workforce reductions and structural realignment. Although we expect that the related cost savings and realization of efficiencies\nwill offset the restructuring related costs over time, we may not achieve the desired net benefits of these efforts (see Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges\" and \"Business Update\" within Item 7 for further discussion of our restructuring activities and future anticipated cost savings).\nRecent disruptions in global oil markets have adversely affected our business and results of operations and similar events in the future may adversely affect our business and results.\nAs a result of the political tensions between several large oil producing countries, there was a substantial decline in oil prices that occurred during the latter half of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. In addition, decreases in demand for oil due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected oil prices, as well as impacted accessibility to job sites. A portion of our revenues is derived from customers in the midstream and downstream oil & gas industry and business with these customers and our results of operations during that period, were adversely affected by these events. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic and/or political tensions continue to significantly depress the price of oil, or global oil markets experience similar disruptions in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nLarge or rapid increases in the costs of commodities and raw materials, including impact of tariffs, or substantial decreases in their availability could adversely affect our operations.\nThe primary raw materials that are used in our products include steel, plastic resin, brass, steel wire and rubber. Most of our suppliers are not currently parties to long-term contracts with us. Consequently, we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials, including the impact of tariffs. Factors such as supply and demand, freight costs and transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the prices of raw materials we need. If we experience a significant increase in raw material prices, or if we are unable to pass along increases in raw material prices to our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, an increasing portion of our products are sourced from low-cost regions. Changes in export regulations, taxes, tariffs and disruptions in transportation routes or supply from regions that we source commodities and raw materials could adversely impact our results of operations.\nUncertainty over global tariffs, or the financial impact of tariffs, may negatively affect our results.\nChanges in U.S. domestic and global tariff frameworks have increased our costs of producing goods and resulted in additional risks to our supply chain. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate previously implemented and, in some cases, proposed tariff increases, but there is no assurance we will be able to continue to mitigate prolonged tariffs. Further, uncertainties about future tariff changes could result in mitigation actions that prove to be ineffective or detrimental to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nA material disruption at a significant manufacturing facility could adversely affect our ability to generate sales and result in increased costs that we cannot recover.\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected due to our inability to meet customer demand for our products or services in the event of a material disruption at one of our significant manufacturing or services facilities. Equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes or other influences could create a material disruption. Interruptions to production could increase our cost of sales, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain our customers. Our business continuity plans may not be sufficient to address disruptions attributable to such risks. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur significant reliance on third-party suppliers for components for the manufacture, assembly and sale of our products, including a supply chain interruption due to political tensions with China or the COVID-19 pandemic, involves risks.\nWe rely on suppliers to secure component products and finished goods required for the manufacture and assembly of our products, and, in some cases, we have consolidated our purchases of such components with one or few suppliers. Further, a significant portion of our suppliers are located in China. A disruption in deliveries to or from key suppliers, or decreased availability of components or commodities, either due to political tensions with China, COVID-19 impacts or other causes could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Further, poor supplier quality or an insecure supply chain could adversely affect the availability, reliability, performance and reputation of our products. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets, so we may be forced to cut prices or incur additional costs.\nOur business generally faces substantial competition, domestically and internationally, in our end markets. We may lose market share in certain businesses or be forced to reduce prices or incur increased costs to maintain existing business. We compete globally on the basis of product design, quality, availability, performance and customer service. Present or future competitors in our markets may have new technologies or more attractive products and services or greater financial, technical or other resources which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins to compete with us.\nOur international operations pose political, currency and other risks.\nWe expect sales from and into foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States, including China, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our international operations present significant and varied risks, such as from political tensions among China and the United States, the uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, currency exchange rate fluctuations, exposure to local economic and political conditions, export and import restrictions and controls on repatriation of cash. Foreign currency exchange rates result in volatility in our financial results, as over one-third of our sales are generated outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, United States tax reform has significantly changed how foreign operations are taxed in the United States. Therefore, we continue to review our organizational structure, and changes to where income is generated, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. To the extent that we expand our international presence, these risks may increase.\nOur customers and other business partners often require terms and conditions that expose us to significant risks and liabilities.\nWe operate in end markets and industries in which our customers and business partners seek to contractually shift significant risks associated with their operations or projects to us. We structure our commercial and contracting practices to assess and manage the risks we are assuming, but we cannot assure that material liabilities will not arise from our contracts with our business partners. Also, our contracting standards may be more stringent than those of certain competitors, and as a result, we may experience market share losses or the reduction in growth opportunities.\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to many laws and regulations that may change in ways that are detrimental to our competitiveness or results.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation under a broad range of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. Some of those laws and regulations may change in ways that will require us to modify our business practices and objectives in ways that adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations, including by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting our operations to escalating costs or prohibiting us from operating in certain jurisdictions. Examples of laws or regulations that may have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and growth strategies include tax law, export and import controls, anti-corruption law, competition law, data privacy regulations, currency controls and economic or political sanctions.\nLegal compliance risks could result in significant costs to our business or cause us to restrict current activities or curtail growth plans.\nWe directly or indirectly operate in industries, markets and jurisdictions in which we are exposed to compliance risks and that are subject to significant scrutiny by regulators, governmental authorities and other persons. We structure and strengthen our risk management and compliance programs to mitigate such risks and foster compliance with all applicable laws, but our practices may not be sufficient to eliminate these risks. The global and diverse nature of our operations, the complex and high-risk nature of some of our markets, our reliance on third-party agents and representatives to support sales and other business activities, and increasingly stringent laws and enforcement activities could result in violations of law, enforcement actions or private litigation resulting in significant defense and investigation costs, fines and penalties, and a broad range of remedial actions, including potential restrictions on our operations and other adverse changes to our business plans. See Note 16, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about compliance risks.\nHealth, safety and environmental laws and regulations may result in additional costs.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing public and worker health and safety. Violations of these laws could result in significant harm and financial liabilities that could adversely affect our operating results and reputation. Pursuant to such laws, governmental authorities have required us to contribute to the cost of investigating or remediating certain matters at current or previously owned and operated sites. In addition, we have provided environmental indemnities for previously owned operations in connection with the sale of certain businesses and product lines. Liability as an owner or operator, or as an arranger for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances, can be joint and several and can be imposed without regard to fault. There is a risk that costs relating to these matters could be greater than what we currently expect or exceed our insurance coverage, or that additional remediation and compliance obligations could arise which require us to make material expenditures. More stringent environmental laws, unanticipated remediation requirements or the discovery of previously unknown conditions could materially harm our financial condition and operating results. We are also required to comply with environmental laws and regulations to maintain operating permits and licenses, some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time, for many of our businesses, and our business operations could be restricted if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require.\nCosts and liabilities arising from legal proceedings could be material and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, including litigation asserting product liability and warranty claims. We maintain insurance and have established reserves for these matters as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and practices. Insurance coverage, to the extent it is available, may not cover all losses arising from such contingencies. Also, estimating legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, and we cannot predict the occurrence, magnitude and outcome of such additional matters. Moreover, we operate in jurisdictions where claims involving us may be adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in such markets.\nRisks Related to the Execution of Our Strategy\nIf we fail to develop new products, or customers do not accept our new products, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop innovative new products can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products, or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies, may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems, experience development cost overruns, or the market does not accept our new products, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions, which we may not be able to consummate or successfully integrate.\nWe plan to make acquisitions to grow our business, enhance our global market position and broaden our industrial tools product offerings. Our ability to successfully execute acquisitions will be impacted by factors including the availability of financing on terms acceptable to us, the potential reduction of our ability or willingness to incur debt to fund acquisitions due to COVID-19 impacts on our financial results, the reluctance of target companies to sell in current markets, our ability to identify acquisition candidates that meet our valuation parameters and increased competition for acquisitions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations also may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Although we expect to successfully integrate any acquired businesses, we may not achieve the desired net benefit in the timeframe planned. Failure to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate the acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to realize planned benefits from acquired companies.\nWe may not be able to realize planned benefits from acquired companies. Achieving those benefits depends on the timely, efficient and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including integrating the acquired business into the Company. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve these benefits include:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating and managing personnel, financial reporting and other systems used by the acquired businesses;\n\u2022the failure of acquired businesses to perform in accordance with our expectations;\n\u2022failure to achieve anticipated synergies between our business units and the business units of acquired businesses;\n\u2022the loss of customers of acquired businesses;\n\u2022the loss of key managers and employees of acquired businesses; or\n\u2022other material adverse events in the acquired businesses.\nIf acquired businesses do not operate as we anticipate, it could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements may result in unexpected liabilities.\nCertain acquisition agreements from past and current acquisitions require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies. In most of these agreements, the liability of the former owners is limited to specific warranties given in the agreement as well as in amount and duration. Certain former owners also may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. As a result of those limitations, we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nDivestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and retained liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn connection with the execution of our strategy to become a pure-play industrial tools and services company, we have recently completed several divestitures, including the divestiture of our former EC&S segment. These divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including retained liabilities related to divested businesses, obligations to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities and potential disputes with buyers.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits of these divestitures or our post-completion liabilities and continuing obligations are substantial and exceed our expectations, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue and profits associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. As of August 31, 2020, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $344 million, or 42% of our total assets. The goodwill results from acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. We assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall below current levels, we could be required to recognize a non-cash charge to operating earnings to impair the related goodwill or other intangible assets. There were no goodwill impairment charges and negligible intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2020 (see Note 6, \"Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" for further discussion on goodwill, intangible asset and long-lived asset impairments). Any future goodwill or intangible asset impairments could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur indebtedness could harm our operating flexibility and competitive position.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or other strategic growth initiatives. We have, and expect we will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt which requires interest and principal payments ($255 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility at August 31, 2020). Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur ability to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance our indebtedness and satisfy our other debt and lease obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and credit market conditions, which could be adversely affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financings will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may adversely affect us.\nOur Senior Credit Facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants. These covenants could limit our financial and operating flexibility as well as our ability to plan for and react to market conditions, meet our capital needs and support our strategic priorities and initiatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants also could result in events of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay indebtedness before its due date, and we may not have the financial resources or otherwise be able to arrange alternative financing to do so. Our compliance with the covenants of our Senior Credit Facility may be adversely affected by severe market contractions or disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to the extent they reduce our earnings for a prolonged period and we are not able to reduce our debt levels or cost structure accordingly. Borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are secured by most domestic personal property assets and are guaranteed by most of our domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of the stock of most of our domestic and certain foreign subsidiaries. If borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility were declared or became due and payable immediately as the result of an event of default and we were unable to repay or refinance those borrowings, our lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets and stock. Any event that requires us to repay any of our debt before it is due could require us to borrow additional amounts at unfavorable borrowing terms, cause a significant reduction in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Moreover, if we are required to repay any of our debt before it becomes due, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts or otherwise obtain the cash necessary to repay that debt, when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Other Matters\nOur inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur ability to deliver financial results and drive growth and pursue competitive advantages in our business substantially depends on our ability to retain key employees and continually attract new talent to the business. If we experience losses of key employees, such as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or experience significant delays or difficulty in replacing them, our operations, competitive position and financial results may be adversely affected. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and our competitors and other employers may attempt to hire our skilled and key employees. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience to operate our businesses successfully. From time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs.\nCyber security vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.\nIncreased global cyber security vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cyber security failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to our systems, operations and products and potentially those of our business partners. An attack also could result in security breaches, theft, lost or corrupted data, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, loss of trade secrets and commercially valuable information, production downtimes and operational disruptions. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing measures including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, but we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. There is no assurance the financial or operational impact from such threats will not be material.\nOur intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependencies.\nOur patents, trademarks and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services functionally equivalent or superior to our own or adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our innovations and technology. In addition, further steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including non-disclosure agreements, may not prevent the misappropriation of our business critical secrets and information. In such circumstances, our competitive position and the value of our brand may be negatively impacted.\nOur competitors or other persons could assert that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.\nWe may be the target of enforcement of patents or other intellectual property rights by third parties. We have implemented legal reviews and other controls in our new product development and marketing processes system to mitigate the risk of infringing third-party rights, but those controls may not prove adequate or deter all claims. Responding to infringement claims, regardless of their merits, can be expensive and time consuming. If we are found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our current products and services.\nGeopolitical unrest and terrorist activities may cause the economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad to deteriorate, which could harm our business.\nTerrorist attacks against targets in the U.S. or abroad, rumors or threats of war, other geopolitical activity or trade disruptions may cause general economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad to deteriorate. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or in other areas and could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11581, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "EPAC"}
