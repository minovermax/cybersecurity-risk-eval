Risk Factors\nThe statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expected financial position, results of operations, business and financing plans found in Item 1. Business and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d believe,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cunderstand,\u201d \u201congoing,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d or similar expressions and the negative of such words and expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words or expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us. While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. The actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements could differ materially from those stated in such forward-looking statements.\nOur actual results may differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those discussed below. Accordingly, readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K should consider these factors in evaluating, and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on, the forward-looking statements contained herein. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nOur success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion, functionality and product trends.\nOur success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion, functionality and product trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner, especially in the wearable technology market. The purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as brand image, marketing programs, functionality and product design. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences in a timely manner while preserving the authenticity and the quality of our brands. Although we attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and fashion trends and technology advances affecting accessories, any failure by us to identify and respond to such trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our existing brand names and product lines, which in turn could result in inventory valuation reserves and adversely affect sales of our products. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, we have experienced decreasing net sales across most product categories; in particular, net sales of watches have declined, reflecting the decline in the traditional watch market partly offset by wearables. If we are unable to adjust our product offerings and reverse the decrease in net sales, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products, including wearable technology.\nOur success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products in the respective markets in which we compete. Wearable technology is a growing category of fashion that offers customers new functionality with accessories, including jewelry and smartwatches. Our ability to respond to consumer preferences for wearable technology will depend in part on establishing successful partnerships with or acquiring companies that are involved in developing wearable technology. If we are unable to establish such partnerships or make meaningful acquisitions, this could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demands for wearable technology. Additionally, we may be unable to enhance and develop our products to satisfy consumer demands for wearable technology or we may fail to do so in a timely manner or at competitive prices. We may also fail to understand or estimate correctly the dynamics of this new market, such as allowances for sales returns, warranty liabilities, inventory reserves or the allowance for bad debts attributable to this new product category. The process of developing new products is complex and uncertain, and involves time, substantial costs and risks, which are further magnified when the development process involves integrating new technology or operating systems. Our inability or the inability of our partners, for technological or other reasons, some of which may be beyond our or our partners' control, to enhance, develop, manufacture, distribute and monetize wearable technology products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing consumer preferences for wearable technology, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our products not achieving market acceptance or becoming obsolete. If we are unable to successfully introduce new products, or if our competitors introduce new or superior products, customers may purchase increasing amounts of products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. Further, it may take time to establish a stable position in the wearable technology category and any initial results should not be taken as a guarantee of future trends.\nAny deterioration in the global economic environment, and any resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainty in global markets, slowing economic growth, high levels of unemployment and eroding consumer confidence can negatively impact the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This can affect our business as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. Global economic conditions remain uncertain, and the possibility remains that domestic or global economies, or certain industry sectors of those economies that are key to our sales, may slow or deteriorate, which could result in a corresponding decrease in demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recently expanded, and intend to further expand, the scope of our product offerings, and new products introduced by us may not achieve consumer acceptance comparable to that of our existing product lines.\nWe have recently expanded, and intend to further expand, the scope of our product offerings, particularly in the wearable technology space. As is typical with new products, market acceptance of new designs and products is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs and technology development several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured. If trends shift away from our products, if our wearable technology becomes outdated or if we misjudge the market for our product lines, including demand for older generation technology products, we may be faced with significant amounts of unsold inventory or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in fiscal 2019, we booked a $38 million inventory valuation adjustment primarily for excess levels of older generation connected watches.\nThe failure of new product designs or new product lines to gain market acceptance could also adversely affect our business and the image of our brands. Achieving market acceptance for new products or technology may also require\nsubstantial marketing efforts and expenditures to generate consumer demand. These requirements could strain our management, financial and operational resources. If we do not continue to develop innovative products that provide better design, technology and performance attributes than the products of our competitors and that are accepted by consumers, or if our future product lines misjudge consumer demands, we may lose consumer loyalty, which could result in a decline in our sales and market share.\nTariffs or other restrictions placed on imports from China and any retaliatory trade measures taken by China could materially harm our revenue and results of operations.\nIn July and August 2018, the Trump Administration imposed 25% ad valorem duties on certain goods comprising an estimated $50 billion of inbound trade from China (\u201cList 1\u201d and \u201cList 2\u201d). Certain of our packaging and handbag products were impacted with these additional 25% ad valorem tariffs, based on the first sale export price as imported into the United States. In September 2018, the Trump Administration imposed additional tariffs amounting to 10% ad valorem on thousands of categories of goods covering an estimated $200 billion of inbound trade from China, including certain electronics (\u201cList 3\u201d). On June 15, 2019, the Trump Administration increased these tariffs to 25% ad valorem. Certain of our handbag and wallet products were also impacted with these additional 25% ad valorem tariffs, based on the first sale export price as imported into the United States. In September 2019, the Trump Administration issued a proposal to further increase Lists 1-3 tariffs to 30% ad valorem, but these increases were postponed indefinitely on October 11, 2019.\nIn August 2019, the Trump Administration announced new 10% ad valorem tariffs that cover the remaining estimated $300 billion of inbound trade from China, including smart watches and several of our traditional watch products. The Trump Administration increased these tariffs to 15% ad valorem in a subsequent notice. The 15% ad valorem tariffs went into effect on September 1, 2019 for some products, including smart watches, certain traditional watches, and certain jewelry products (\u201cList 4A\u201d). Smart watches had received an exemption from List 3 in 2018, but the Trump Administration re-included smart watches as subject to tariffs effective September 1, 2019.\nOn December 18, 2019, in anticipation of reaching an agreement with China, the Trump Administration postponed indefinitely the imposition of additional tariffs on the remaining items (\u201cList 4B\u201d). On January 15, 2020, the United States and China signed the \u201cEconomic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People\u2019s Republic of China - Phase One.\u201d In conjunction with that agreement, the Trump Administration announced that it would reduce the List 4A tariffs from 15% ad valorem to 7.5% ad valorem, effective February 14, 2020.\nFollowing a ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is currently being contested, the List 4A tariffs apply broadly to our traditional watches that incorporate a watch movement from China. They also generally apply to China-sourced cases and bands on watches assembled in China and other countries.\nIt is difficult to accurately estimate the impact on our business from these tariff actions or similar actions. However, assuming no further offsets from price increases, sourcing changes, or other changes to regulatory rulings, all of which are currently under review, the estimated gross profit exposure from the List 4A tariffs is $9.5 million in fiscal year 2020.\nThe Trump Administration intends to negotiate with China toward a \u201cPhase Two\u201d agreement, which could lead to the lowering or removal of additional tariffs. However, if the tariffs continue or increase, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China or otherwise change our sourcing strategy for these products, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations. Even if the United States further modifies these tariffs, it is always possible that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results.\nU.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017 may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), following its passage by the United States Congress. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including changing the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, introducing a capital investment deduction in certain circumstances, placing certain limitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain net operating losses, and making extensive changes to the U.S. international tax system. The new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions of the Tax Act requiring the inclusion of certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income increased our effective tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and will continue to increase it in future years. Technically, corporate shareholders of foreign corporations generating GILTI are generally entitled to a 50% deduction against such income, lowering the effective rate of tax from 21% to 10.5%. Furthermore, they are able to recognize a foreign tax credit\nfor 80% of local taxes paid on GILTI income. Therefore, as long as the foreign group's average effective rate is 13.125% or more, the tax associated with GILTI should be fully offset by foreign tax credits. However, when a corporation has a domestic source loss, the GILTI absorbs this loss, eliminating any ability to carry the loss forward to offset future income. Our effective foreign income tax rate is significantly higher than the intended 13.125% threshold. However, the GILTI consumed our domestic source loss for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, preventing the recognition of a tax benefit on the domestic source loss. The impact of the GILTI provision of the Tax Act was included in our financial statements for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. We account for GILTI as incurred under the period cost method. As a result of these new provisions, especially the GILTI, our effective tax rates in fiscal 2018 and 2019 were 104.7% and (59.6)%, respectively, which substantially exceeded the federal statutory rate of 21.0%. The impact of these new rules could be adverse in future years.\nThe effects of economic cycles, terrorism, acts of war and retail industry conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary fashion accessories, such as our watches, jewelry, handbags, sunglasses and other products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and consumers are hesitant to use available credit. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war and military action both in the U.S. and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to procure our products from manufacturers for sale to our customers. Any significant declines in general economic conditions, public safety concerns or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on consumer purchases of our products.\nThe loss of any of our license agreements for globally recognized fashion brand names may result in the loss of significant revenues and may adversely affect our business.\nWe have entered into multi-year, worldwide exclusive license agreements for the manufacture, distribution and sale of products bearing the brand names of certain globally recognized fashion brands. We sell products under certain licensed brands, including, but not limited to, ARMANI EXCHANGE, BMW, CHAPS, DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, KATE SPADE NEW YORK, MICHAEL KORS, PUMA and TORY BURCH. Sales of our licensed products amounted to approximately 45.7% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2019, including MICHAEL KORS product sales, which accounted for approximately 19.2% of our consolidated net sales, and product sales under the ARMANI brands, which accounted for approximately 18.3% of our consolidated net sales.\nOur significant third-party fashion brand license agreements have various expiration dates between the years 2020 and 2028. In addition, many of these license agreements require us to make minimum royalty payments, subject us to restrictive covenants or require us to comply with certain other obligations and may be terminated by the licensor if these or other conditions are not met or upon certain events. For example, our license agreement with MICHAEL KORS provides the licensor with a right to terminate some or all of the licensing rights if we fail to meet certain net sales thresholds for two consecutive years. For fiscal year 2019, we met net sales thresholds for MICHAEL KORS. If we are unable to achieve the minimum net sales thresholds, restrictive covenants and/or other obligations of a license in the future, we would need to seek a waiver of the non-compliance from the applicable licensor or amend the agreement to modify the thresholds, covenants or obligations or face the possibility that the licensor could terminate the license agreement before its expiration date. Though waivers may be obtained for non-compliance, we, or the licensor, may instead elect to modify or terminate the license agreement. For example, in 2018, we mutually agreed with MARC JACOBS to an earlier termination date of our license agreement in 2019 from the original expiration date at the end of 2020.\nIn addition, we may be unable to renew our existing license agreements beyond the current term or obtain new license agreements to replace any lost license agreements on similar economic terms or at all. The failure by us to maintain or renew one or more of our existing license agreements could result in a significant decrease in our sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe loss of our license for Google\u2019s WEAR OS operating system may result in the loss of significant revenues and may adversely affect our business.\nOur full display smartwatches use Google\u2019s WEAR OS operating system. We have a current license for WEAR OS that expires on May 1, 2020. We are currently negotiating with Google on the renewal of our WEAR OS license. Sales of our full display smartwatches running the WEAR OS operating system amounted to approximately 12.6% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2019. We may be unable to renew our existing license for WEAR OS beyond the current term. The failure by us to maintain or renew our license for WEAR OS could result in us being unable to produce and market full display smartwatches, which could result in a significant decrease in our sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans.\nAs we announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we have implemented, and plan to continue to implement, a restructuring plan to reinvent the Company, strengthen the foundation of the Company for the future and support long-term sales growth and profitability objectives. The program is intended to touch all aspects of the business, enhance operating capabilities, create greater efficiencies and take advantage of the Company's considerable scale. During fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $29.6 million, $46.6 million and $48.2 million of restructuring charges, respectively. Restructuring plans present significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plan, management distraction and employee attrition in excess of headcount reductions. If this program is not successful, then our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Credit Agreements subject us to certain covenants, which may restrict our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreements or any agreement under which we have incurred other indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOn September 26, 2019, the Company and Fossil Partners L.P., as the U.S. borrowers, and Fossil Group Europe GmbH, Fossil Asia Pacific Limited, Fossil (Europe) GmbH, Fossil (UK) Limited and Fossil Canada Inc., as the non-U.S. borrowers, certain other subsidiaries of the Company from time to time party thereto designated as borrowers, and certain subsidiaries of the Company from time to time party thereto as guarantors, entered into a $275.0 million secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan AG, as French collateral agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto. In addition, on September 26, 2019, the Company, as borrower, entered into a $200.0 million secured Term Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers and the lenders party thereto, which was amended on February 20, 2020, by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Term Credit Agreement (as amended to date, the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d).\nThe Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities. These restrictions limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain types of stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem our stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nsell assets and issue capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans to other Fossil entities or restrict the ability to incur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing future indebtedness, could seriously harm our business and our ability to grow in accordance with our growth strategy by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThe Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests in certain circumstances.\nThe Revolving Facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if our Availability (as defined in the Revolving Facility) falls below a certain threshold. The Term Loan Facility contains a total leverage ratio covenant requiring the total leverage ratio to be not greater than 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter during 2020, 2.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each of the first three fiscal quarters of 2021, and 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each subsequent fiscal quarter. The Term Loan Facility also requires that the Company not permit Liquidity (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) as of the last day of any fiscal month to be less than $150.0 million. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading \u201cDebt Facilities\u201d for an additional discussion of the financial covenants contained in the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, an event of default under the Revolving Facility would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Revolving Facility, and a payment default under the Revolving Facility would trigger a cross default under the Term Loan Facility. Furthermore, both the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility are secured by liens on our assets. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our Revolving Facility or Term Loan Facility, the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nThe Revolving Facility provides the lenders considerable discretion to impose reserves or availability blocks or to determine that certain assets are not eligible for inclusion in our borrowing base, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Revolving Facility will not take such actions during the term of that facility and, further, were they to do so, the resulting impact of such actions could materially and adversely impair our ability to meet our other obligations as they become due, among other matters.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted under our Revolving Facility may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our Revolving Facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of, among other things, our eligible accounts receivable and inventory. As a result, our access to credit under our Revolving Facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the administrative agent of our Revolving Facility in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. In addition, the Term Loan Facility limits the amount of borrowings in aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding under the Revolving Facility to $200.0 million. Our inability to borrow at current advance rates or at all under, or the early termination of, our Revolving Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility are at variable rates of interest based on the base rate or the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nTo the extent we make borrowings based on LIBOR, LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on multiple factors, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established or if LIBOR continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index. These changes may have a negative impact on our interest expense and profitability.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nThe Revolving Facility provides that the lenders thereunder may extend revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $275.0 million at any time outstanding, subject to the Term Loan Facility and borrowing base availability limitations. The Term Loan Facility provides for term loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. As of December 28, 2019, we had $200.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $28.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility.\nThe covenants under the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources in certain circumstances.\nAs a result of our existing indebtedness and our capacity to incur additional indebtedness, we are, and anticipate continuing to be, a highly leveraged company. A significant portion of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under our Revolving Facility or Term Loan Facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit requires us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the repayment of our indebtedness, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, and such cash flow may not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit limits our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nwe are more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nit may increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nit may restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\ndebt service requirements could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our other indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nthere would be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future sources of capital under the Revolving Facility, Term Loan Facility or otherwise may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we complete an acquisition, our debt service requirements could increase. We may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances or restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility restrict our ability to conduct asset sales and to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nWe may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured debt. This could intensify already-existing risks related to our indebtedness.\nThe terms of the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility contain restrictions on our and the guarantors\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we or the guarantors could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, much of which could constitute secured, senior, or pari passu indebtedness. As\nof December 28, 2019, our Revolving Facility provided for unused borrowing capacity of up to $120.1 million. If new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the related risks that we and the guarantors now face could intensify.\nRepayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nRepayment of our indebtedness, to a certain degree, is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries (including any subsidiaries that are not guarantors) and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions or other payments to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable U.S. and foreign legal and contractual restrictions or our permanently invested assertion may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the terms of the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nWe have recorded impairment charges in the past and may record impairment charges in the future.\nWe are required, at least annually, or as facts and circumstances warrant, to test trade names to determine if impairment has occurred. We are also required to test property plant and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment as facts and circumstances warrant. Impairment may result from any number of factors, including adverse changes in assumptions used for valuation purposes, such as actual or projected net sales, growth rates, profitability or discount rates, or other variables. If the testing indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge. Should the value of trade names, property plant and equipment and other long lived assets become impaired, it would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur inability to effectively manage our retail store operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, our global comparable retail store sales decreased 4%. During fiscal year 2020, we intend to open approximately 10 new stores globally and close approximately 20 stores, depending on lease negotiations. The success of our retail business depends, in part, on our ability to open new profitable stores, close low performing stores and renew our existing store leases on terms that meet our financial targets. Our ability to open new stores on schedule or at all, to close low performing stores and to renew existing store leases on favorable terms or to operate them on a profitable basis will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable markets for new stores and available store locations;\n\u2022\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms for new locations or renewal terms for existing locations;\n\u2022\nhire and train qualified sales associates;\n\u2022\ndevelop new merchandise and manage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nmaintain favorable relationships with major developers and other landlords; and\n\u2022\navoid construction delays and cost overruns in connection with the build-out of new stores.\nOur plans to manage our store base may not be successful and the opening of new stores may not result in an increase in our net sales even though they increase our costs. Our inability to effectively manage our retail store base could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew technologies could render our wearable technology obsolete.\nNew developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of our wearable technology or make such products obsolete. Our inability to enhance our existing wearable technology in a timely manner or to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could negatively impact our competitive position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIncreased competition from online only retailers and a highly promotional retail environment may increase pressure on our margins.\nThe continued increase in e-commerce competitors for retail sales and slowing mall traffic has resulted in significant pricing pressure and a highly promotional retail environment. In addition, the traditional watch market has declined in recent years. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCertain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products.\nWe and our contract manufacturers currently purchase a number of key components used to manufacture our products from limited sources of supply for which alternative sources may not be readily available. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contract or manufacturers' control. In addition, the purchase of these components on a limited source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems. An increase in the cost of components could make our products less competitive and result in lower gross margins. In the event that we can no longer obtain materials from these limited sources of supply, we might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from a limited source or delay in transitioning to a replacement supplier could disrupt our operations and significantly harm our business in any given period. If our supply of certain components is disrupted, our lead times are extended or the cost of our components increases, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially affected.\nThe loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business.\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Kosta N. Kartsotis, our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chairman. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies for any of our personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.\nA data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships, expose us to litigation or government actions, and result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on information technology systems, the Internet and computer networks for a substantial portion of our retail and e-commerce businesses, including credit card transaction authorization and processing. We also receive and store personal information about our customers and employees, the protection of which is critical to us. In the normal course of our business, we collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. Our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. In addition, personal information is highly regulated at the international, federal and state level.\nDespite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to theft of physical information, security breaches, hacking attempts, computer viruses and malware, ransomware, phishing, lost data and programming and/or human errors. Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security or those of our third party service providers, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our customer relationships, expose us to litigation and liability, subject us to governmental investigations, fines and enforcement actions, result in negative media coverage and distraction to management and result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, as a result of security breaches at a number of prominent retailers and other companies, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment related thereto has become more uncertain. As a result, we may incur significant costs in complying with new and existing state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information. A successful ransomware attack on our systems could make them inaccessible for a period of time pending the payment of a ransom to unlock the systems or our ability to otherwise restore our access to our systems.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and the many countries in which we operate. Violations of laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, consumer protection, real estate, product safety, e-commerce, promotions, intellectual property, tax, import and export, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation, data privacy, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these numerous laws and regulations is complicated, time\nconsuming and expensive, and the laws and regulations may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the difficulty and cost to comply with them. New laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, could individually or in the aggregate make our products more costly to produce, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, cause us to change or limit our business practices, or affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the numerous laws and regulations affecting our business, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws, regulations or our policies related thereto. Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nReduced lending by banks could have a negative impact on our customers, suppliers and business partners, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAny reduction in lending by banks may have a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. Although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities currently provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of reduced lending on our customers, business partners and suppliers cannot be predicted and may be quite severe. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers or distributors to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses, which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nSeasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal cycles, timing of new product introductions, timing of orders by our customers and mix of product sales demand. Our business is seasonal by nature. A significant portion of our net sales and operating income are generated during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which includes the \"back to school\" and holiday seasons. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal fourth quarter depends upon the anticipated level of retail sales during the holiday season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In addition, the amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal first quarter depends in part upon the actual level of retail sales during the holiday season. The seasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.\nThe amount of traffic to our retail stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls and retail centers in which our stores are located.\nThere continues to be a significant decrease in traffic in many of the shopping malls and retail centers in which our stores are located, which has resulted in decreased traffic to our stores. The resulting decrease in customers for our retail stores has had an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, several national department store anchors have closed or will be closing a number of their locations in shopping malls, which is likely to further decrease traffic and put increasing financial strain on the operators of those shopping mall locations. The loss of an anchor or other significant tenant in a shopping mall in which we have a store, or the closure of a significant number of shopping malls in which we have stores, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have key facilities in the U.S. and overseas, the loss or shut down of any of which could harm our business.\nOur administrative, information technology and distribution operations in the U.S. are conducted primarily from two separate facilities located in the Dallas, Texas area. Our operations internationally are conducted from various administrative, distribution and assembly facilities outside of the U.S., particularly in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Vietnam. The complete or temporary loss of use of all or part of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur warehouse and distribution facilities in the Dallas, Texas area are operated in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. Although the sub-zone allows us certain tax advantages, the sub-zone is highly regulated by the U.S. Customs Service. This level of regulation may cause disruptions or delays in the distribution of our products out of these facilities. Under some circumstances, the U.S. Customs Service has the right to shut down the entire sub-zone and, therefore, our entire warehouse and distribution facilities. During the time that the sub-zone is shut down, we may be unable to adequately meet the supply requests of our customers and our Company-owned retail stores, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, relationships with our customers, and results of operations, especially if the shutdown were to occur during our third or fourth quarter.\nOur ability to reverse negative sales trends and grow our sales is dependent upon the implementation of our business strategy, which we may not be able to achieve.\nOur ability to reverse negative sales trends and grow our sales is dependent on the successful implementation of our business strategy. This includes diversification and innovation of our product offerings, continuing to develop wearable technology, improving our omni-channel capabilities and strategic acquisitions. If we are not successful in the expansion or development of our product offerings or our new products are not profitable or do not generate sales comparable to those of our existing businesses, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe also operate FOSSIL brand stores and other non-FOSSIL branded stores globally to further strengthen our brand image. As of December 28, 2019, we operated 451 stores worldwide. The costs associated with leasehold improvements to current stores and the costs associated with opening new stores and closing low performing stores could materially increase our costs of operation.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels.\nWe maintain an inventory of selected products that we anticipate will be in high demand. We may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or the sale of excess inventory at prices below our standard levels, particularly in the smartwatch category where customer demand for products with older generation technology may be difficult to predict. These events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues, any of which could harm our business.\nOur license agreements may require minimum royalty commitments regardless of the level of product sales under these agreements.\nUnder our license agreements, we have in the past experienced, and could again in the future experience, instances where our minimum royalty commitments exceeded the royalties payable based upon our sales of the licensed products. Payments of minimum royalties in excess of the royalties based on our sales of the licensed products reduce our margins and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays and increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the raw materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or ability to meet our customers' demands. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including natural resources, increased freight costs, increased labor costs, especially in China, and weather conditions. In the future, we may not be able to pass on all, or a portion of, such higher raw materials prices to our customers.\nWe rely on third-party assembly factories and manufacturers; and problems with, or loss of, our assembly factories or manufacturing sources could harm our business and results of operations.\nA substantial percentage of our watch and jewelry products are currently assembled or manufactured to our specifications by our majority-owned entities in China, with the remainder assembled or manufactured by independent entities. All of our handbags, small leather goods, belts and soft accessories are produced by independent manufacturers. We have no long-term contracts with these independent assembly factories or manufacturers and compete with other companies for production facilities. All transactions between us and our independent assembly factories or manufacturers are conducted on the basis of purchase orders. We face the risk that these independent assembly factories or manufacturers may not produce and deliver our products on a timely basis, or at all. As a result, we cannot be certain that these assembly factories or manufacturers will continue to assemble or manufacture products for us or that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, shortages of raw materials, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain close relationships with, or ownership of, our current assembly factories and manufacturers and to develop long-term relationships with other manufacturers that satisfy our requirements for price, quality and production flexibility. Our ability to establish new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery. Any failure by us to maintain long-term relationships with, or ownership of, our current assembly factories and manufacturers or to develop relationships with other manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products.\nIf an independent manufacturer or license partner of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices or otherwise comply with laws or suffers reputation harm, our business could suffer.\nWhile we have a code of conduct for our manufacturing partners, we have no control over the ultimate actions or labor practices of our independent manufacturers. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers, or by one of our license partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or license partner's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other countries in which the violation or divergence occurred, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. In addition, certain of our license agreements are with named globally recognized fashion designers. Should one of these fashion designers, or any or our licensor companies, conduct themselves inappropriately or make controversial statements, the underlying brand, and consequently our business under that brand, could suffer. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, should one of our independent manufacturers or licensors be found in violation of state or international laws or receive negative publicity, we could suffer financial or other unforeseen consequences.\nWe extend unsecured credit to our customers and are therefore vulnerable to any financial difficulties they may face.\nWe sell our merchandise primarily to department stores, specialty retail stores and distributors worldwide. We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. Should any of our larger customers experience financial difficulties, we could curtail business with such customers or assume more credit risk relating to such customers' receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable relating to such customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not maintain long-term contracts with our customers and are unable to control their purchasing decisions.\nWe do not maintain long-term purchasing contracts with our customers and therefore have no contractual leverage over their purchasing decisions. A decision by a major department store or other significant customer to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating strategy.\nWe face intense competition in the specialty retail and e-commerce industries and the size and resources of some of our competitors are substantially greater than ours, which may allow them to compete more effectively.\nWe face intense competition in the specialty retail and e-commerce industry where we compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores and e-commerce businesses that engage in the retail sale of watches and accessories. We believe that the principal basis upon which we compete is the quality and design of merchandise and the quality of customer service. We also believe that price is an important factor in our customers' decision-making processes. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and generate greater national brand recognition than we can, especially in the developing area of omni-channel retailing. Omni-channel retailing may include retail stores, e-commerce sites, mobile channels and other direct-to-consumer points of contact that enhance the consumer\u2019s ability to interact with a retailer in the research, purchase, returning and serving of products. The intense competition and greater size and resources of some of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our results of operations.\nWe could be negatively impacted if we fail to successfully integrate businesses we may acquire.\nWe have made, and may consider in the future, certain acquisitions, domestically and internationally, including acquisitions of certain watch brands and acquisitions of independent distributors of our products. The integration of future acquisitions may not be successful or generate sales increases. When we have acquired businesses, such as Misfit in December 2015, we have acquired businesses that we believe could enhance our business opportunities and our growth prospects. Acquisitions involve risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndistraction of management from our business operations;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel and other employees;\n\u2022\ncosts, delays, and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of acquired assets and goodwill; and\n\u2022\nacquiring the contingent and other liabilities of the businesses we acquire.\nIn addition, acquired businesses may not provide us with increased business opportunities or result in the growth that we anticipate. Furthermore, integrating acquired operations is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Combining acquired operations with our current operations may result in lower overall operating margins, greater stock price volatility and quarterly earnings fluctuations. Cultural incompatibilities, career uncertainties and other factors associated with such acquisitions may also result in the loss of employees. Failure to acquire and successfully integrate complementary practices, or failure to achieve the business synergies or other anticipated benefits, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition from traditional competitors as well as new competitors in the wearable technology category.\nThere is intense competition in each of the businesses in which we compete. In all of our businesses, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors who may have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than us. Our competitors include distributors that import watches and accessories from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories domestically. In addition, we face growing competition from technology companies that have or are launching smartwatch products and other wearable technology. These new competitors have not historically competed with us, and many have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than us. The impact of wearable technology products on sales of our traditional product lines may be materially adverse. Our results of operations and market position may be adversely affected by our competitors and their competitive pressures in the watch, wearable technology and fashion accessory industries.\nAny material disruption of our information systems could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information systems to operate our websites, process transactions, manage inventory, monitor sales and purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis. We utilize SAP ERP in our U.S. operations and throughout most of our European operations to support our human resources, sales and distribution, inventory planning, retail merchandising and operational and financial reporting systems of our business, and Navision in our Asian operations to support many of the same functions on a local country level. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, ransomware, computer \"hackers\" or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost, unavailable or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. Moreover, the failure to maintain, or a disruption in, financial and management control systems could have a material adverse effect on our ability to respond to trends in our target markets, market our products and meet our customers' requirements.\nIn addition, we have e-commerce and other websites in the U.S. and internationally. In addition to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to Internet usage, we are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches, and consumer privacy concerns. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce e-commerce sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brands.\nChanges in the mix of product sales demand could negatively impact our gross profit margins.\nOur gross profit margins are impacted by our sales mix as follows:\nSales channel mix: sales from our direct retail and e-commerce channels typically provide gross margins in excess of our historical consolidated gross profit margins, while sales from our distributor, mass market and off-price channels typically provide gross margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins.\nProduct mix: traditional watch and jewelry sales typically provide gross margins in excess of historical consolidated gross profit margins, while leather goods and private label products typically provide gross margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins. In addition, sales of our wearable technology products have produced gross profit margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins, which we anticipate continuing in fiscal 2019.\nGeographic mix: international sales typically produce gross margins in excess of our historical consolidated gross profit margins, while domestic sales typically provide gross margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins.\nIf future sales from our higher gross margin businesses do not increase at a faster rate than our lower gross margin businesses, our gross profit margins may grow at a slower pace, cease to grow, or decrease relative to our historical consolidated gross profit margin.\nOur industry is subject to pricing pressures that may adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe assemble or source many of our products offshore because they generally cost less to make overseas, due primarily to lower labor costs. Many of our competitors also source their product requirements offshore to achieve lower costs, possibly in locations with lower costs than our offshore operations, and those competitors may use these cost savings to reduce prices. To remain competitive, we must adjust our prices from time to time in response to these industry-wide pricing pressures. Our financial performance may be negatively affected by these pricing pressures if we are forced to reduce our prices and we cannot reduce our production costs or our production costs increase and we cannot increase our prices.\nThe loss of our intellectual property rights may harm our business.\nOur trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We are devoted to the establishment and protection of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights in those countries where we believe it is important to our ability to sell our products. However, we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken will result in enforceable rights, will be adequate to protect our products in every country where we may want to sell our products, will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to prevent sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Additionally, we rely on the patent, trademark and other intellectual property laws of the U.S. and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. Even if we are successful in obtaining appropriate trademark, patent and other intellectual property rights, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. Because we sell our products internationally and are dependent on foreign manufacturing in China, we are significantly dependent on foreign countries to protect our intellectual property rights. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail. The failure to obtain or maintain trademark, patent or other intellectual property rights could materially harm our business.\nOur products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling certain of our products.\nWe cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. The wearable technology space is rapidly developing with new innovation, which will likely result in a significant number of domestic and international patent filings for new technology. As a result, wearable technology companies may be subject to an increasing number of claims that their products infringe the intellectual property rights of competitors or non-practicing entities. As we increase our wearable technology and other product offerings, we have been, are and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties by us and our customers in connection with their marketing and sale of our products. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Moreover, we may need to redesign or rename some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain of our products.\nAn increase in product returns could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe accept limited returns from customers. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. However, as we continue to increase our wearable technology product offerings, we do not have the same level of historical experience estimating returns as we have with our other more mature products, which could result in us underestimating the level of returns. In addition, consumer acceptance of wearable technology products and the inherent outdating of technology over time may result in an increase in the amount of returns we accept from our customers. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting credit returns could have an adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our management, including our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, result in higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could in turn negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our International Operations\nFactors affecting international commerce and our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we generated 63.0% of our net sales from outside of the U.S., and we anticipate that revenue from our international operations could account for an increasingly larger portion of our net sales in the future. Our international operations are directly related to, and dependent on, the volume of international trade and foreign market conditions. International commerce and our international operations are subject to many risks, some of which are discussed in more detail below, including:\n\u2022\nrecessions in foreign economies;\n\u2022\nthe adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or the occurrence of trade wars;\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights under the laws of other countries;\n\u2022\nlonger receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nsocial, political and economic instability;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on travel to and from international locations as a result of viruses, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus;\n\u2022\npolitical tensions between the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with, changes in or adoption of current, new or expanded regulatory requirements, particularly in the wearable technology space;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance foreign operations;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers; and\n\u2022\nU.S. government licensing requirements for exports.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these risks may restrict our ability to operate in the affected regions and decrease the profitability of our international operations, which may seriously harm our financial condition.\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars. However, we source a significant amount of our products overseas and, as such, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the currencies of these countries, including the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Taiwanese dollar. Due to our dependence on manufacturing operations in China, changes in the value of the Chinese yuan may have a material impact on our supply channels and manufacturing costs, including component and assembly costs.\nIn addition, changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the prices at which we sell products in foreign markets. For fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, 63.0%, 59.9% and 58.5% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the U.S. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. For example, due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2019, the translation of foreign based net sales into U.S. dollars reduced our reported net sales by approximately $48.8 million. If the value of the U.S. dollar remains at its current levels or strengthens further against foreign currencies, particularly against the euro, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Canadian dollar, South Korean won, British pound and Japanese yen, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Although we utilize forward contracts to help mitigate foreign currency risks (mostly relating to the euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, Mexican peso and Australian dollar), foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe European economic uncertainty and any further debt crisis could adversely impact our financial condition.\nThe European economic situation, particularly with the withdrawal by the United Kingdom from the European Union, has contributed to instability in certain international credit markets. During fiscal year 2019, we generated 32.4% of our consolidated net sales from our Europe segment. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in Europe remain uncertain or deteriorate, the value of the euro could decline. Any additional financial instability in stressed European countries could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the European Union. If this were to occur or if the value of the euro were to weaken against the U.S. dollar, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe depend on independent distributors to sell our products in certain international markets.\nOur products are sold in certain international markets through independent distributors. If a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals or breaches the terms of our distribution agreement, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor. If a change in our distributors becomes necessary, we may experience increased costs, as well as a substantial disruption in, and a resulting loss of, sales and profits.\nBecause we depend on foreign manufacturing, we are vulnerable to changes in economic and social conditions in Asia, particularly China, and disruptions in international travel and shipping.\nBecause a substantial portion of our watches and jewelry and certain of our handbags, sunglasses and other products are assembled or manufactured in China, our success will depend to a significant extent upon future economic and social conditions existing in China. If the factories in China are disrupted for any reason, we would need to arrange for the manufacture and shipment of products by alternative sources. Because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery, we are unable to predict whether such new relationships would be on terms that we regard as satisfactory. Any significant disruption in our relationships with our manufacturing sources located in China would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. In addition, restrictions on travel to and from this and other regions, such as has occurred with the coronavirus, and any delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, including on account of the coronavirus or other health crises, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer deadlines and timely distribute our products in order to match consumer expectations.\nWe face risks associated with increased political uncertainty.\nIn the U.S., the change in the U.S. government administration has resulted in uncertainty regarding potential changes in regulations, fiscal policy, social programs, domestic and foreign relations and international trade policies. Potential changes in relationships among the U.S., China, Russia and other countries could have significant impacts on global trade and regional economic conditions, among other things. In addition, changes in the relationships between the U.S. and its neighbors, such as\nMexico, could have significant, potentially negative, impacts on commerce. Further, anti-American sentiment could harm the reputation and success of U.S. companies doing business abroad.\nIn Europe, the populist movement resulted in the Brexit vote, and other election results are signaling increasing populist demands and rises in nationalism, which could have a negative impact on economic policy and consequently pose a potential threat to the unity of the European Union.\nOur business is dependent upon its international operations, particularly in Asia and Europe. During fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, we generated 63.0%, 59.9% and 58.5%, respectively, of our net sales outside the U.S. In addition, we source the vast majority of our products from outside the U.S.\nOur ability to respond to these developments or comply with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements, including those involving economic and trade sanctions, could reduce our sales, increase our costs of doing business, reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.\nRisks associated with foreign government regulations and U.S. trade policy may affect our foreign operations and sourcing.\nOur businesses are subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulation in the countries in which our manufacturing sources are located, primarily China. While we have not experienced any material issues with foreign governmental regulations that would impact our arrangements with our foreign manufacturing sources, we believe that this issue is of particular concern with regard to China due to the less mature nature of the Chinese market economy, the historical involvement of the Chinese government in the industry and recent trade tensions between China and the U.S. If regulations were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impracticable, or if our current foreign manufacturing sources were for any other reason to cease doing business with us, such a development could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and on our supply, manufacturing and distribution channels.\nOur business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. For example, our products imported to the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the U.S. and a country that leads to withdrawal of \"most favored nation\" status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and financial condition. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located on imported products, including raw materials.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock\nMany factors may cause our net sales, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate and possibly decline, which may result in declines in our stock price.\nOur net sales, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors may include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in market demand for our products;\n\u2022\nincreased competition and pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate changing customer demands and preferences;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete in the wearable technology space;\n\u2022\ngrowth in our international operations;\n\u2022\nour failure to efficiently manage our inventory levels;\n\u2022\nour inability to manage and maintain our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nseasonality in our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in our, and our competitors', business strategy or pricing;\n\u2022\nimplementation of our restructuring plan;\n\u2022\nthe successful management of our Company-owned retail store operations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of certain selling, general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\ncompleting acquisitions and the costs of integrating acquired operations;\n\u2022\ninternational currency fluctuations, operating challenges and trade regulations;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism or acts of war; and\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation.\nOne or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be unexpectedly high or result in a decrease in our net sales during any given period. If these or any other variables or unknowns were to cause a shortfall in revenues or earnings, an increase in our operating costs or otherwise cause a failure to meet public market expectations, our stock price may decline and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur CEO owns approximately 6.6% of our outstanding common stock.\nMr. Kosta Kartsotis owns approximately 6.6% of our common stock as of December 28, 2019. As a result, he is in a position to influence the outcome of elections of our directors, the adoption, amendment or repeal of our bylaws and any other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders, and to otherwise influence our affairs.\nBecause the interests of Mr. Kartsotis may not coincide with the interests of other stockholders, Mr. Kartsotis may influence the Company to enter into transactions or agreements that other stockholders would not approve or make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree.\nOur organizational documents contain anti-takeover provisions that could discourage a proposal for a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a proposal for a takeover. These include a provision in our certificate of incorporation authorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock and provisions in our bylaws establishing advance notice procedures with respect to certain stockholder proposals. Our bylaws may be amended by a vote of 80% of the Board of Directors, subject to repeal by a vote of 80% of the stockholders. In addition, Delaware law limits the ability of a Delaware corporation to engage in certain business combinations with interested stockholders. Finally, Mr. Kartsotis has the ability, by virtue of his stock ownership, to influence a vote regarding a change in control.\nFailure to meet our financial guidance or achieve other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.\nFrom time to time, we provide public guidance on our expected financial results or disclose other forward-looking information for future periods. We manage our business to maximize our growth and profitability and not to achieve financial or operating targets for any particular reporting period. Although we believe that public guidance may provide investors with a better understanding of our expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential stockholders, such guidance is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Any such guidance or other forward-looking statements are predictions based on our then existing expectations and projections about future events that we believe are reasonable. Actual events or results may differ materially from our expectations, and as such, our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We are under no duty to update any of our forward-looking statements to conform to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by federal securities laws. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investors, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline and stockholders could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume.\nResearch analysts publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts' projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. In 2019, the number of analysts covering our stock decreased from six to three.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Kartsotis may be sold in the open market in the future, subject to any volume restrictions and other limitations under the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 144 thereunder. We may also decide to file a registration statement enabling Mr. Kartsotis to sell additional shares. Any sales by Mr. Kartsotis of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of his shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales could occur. These sales or the possibility that they may occur also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in any equity offering in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.", "PERMNO": 79089, "SIC": 3873, "TIC": "FOSL"}
