{"cik": "1284812", "company": "COHEN & STEERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant portion of our revenue for 2014 was derived from a single institutional client.\nAt December 31, 2014, our largest institutional client, which holds accounts across numerous strategies and in subadvisory and model-based assignments and products, represented approximately 13% of our total revenue for 2014. Approximately 50% of the institutional account assets we managed and approximately 25% of the total assets we managed were derived from this client. In addition, approximately 15% of our assets under advisement was derived from this client. Loss of, or significant withdrawal from, any of these accounts would reduce our revenue.\nA decline in the performance of real estate securities could have an adverse effect on the assets we manage and our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2014, a majority of the assets we managed were concentrated in real estate securities. Real estate securities and real property investments owned by the issuers of real estate securities are subject to varying degrees of risk that could affect any returns we realize. Returns on investments in real estate securities depend on the amount of income and capital appreciation or loss realized by the underlying real property. Income and real estate values may be adversely affected by, among other things, the cost of compliance with applicable laws, interest rates, the availability of financing, the creditworthiness of the tenants, and the limited ability of issuers of real estate securities to vary their portfolios promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. If the underlying properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, the income and the ability of an issuer of real estate securities to pay interest and principal on debt securities or any dividends on common or preferred stocks will be adversely affected. A decline in the performance of real estate securities could reduce the value of the assets we manage, reducing the fees we earn and our revenue.\nFluctuations in the underlying value of the assets we manage could adversely impact revenues and earnings.\nOur investment advisory and management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and, in some cases, performance fees normally expressed as a percentage of the returns in excess of a benchmark. Numerous factors, including movements in equity, debt, commodity, real estate and alternative investment asset prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates or the loss, or reduction in size of, client accounts could cause: (i) the value of our assets under management to decrease, (ii) the returns realized on assets under management to decrease, (iii) clients to withdraw funds in favor of products that they perceive offer greater opportunity or safety than our products, (iv)\nclients to rebalance assets away from products that we manage into products that we may not manage, and (v) clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. The occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory, management, administration and performance fees and cause the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings to decline.\nOur clients and partners may withdraw or reduce the assets we manage or otherwise change the terms of our relationship which could have an adverse impact on our assets under management and revenue.\nOur institutional clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, may terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets we manage, shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee structures, or renegotiate the fees we charge them for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. Certain investors in the mutual funds that we manage hold their shares indirectly through platforms sponsored by financial institutions that have the authority to make investment and asset allocation decisions on behalf of such shareholders. Any such decision may cause the fund to sell assets at a disadvantageous time or price which could negatively affect the value of our assets under management. In a declining market or conditions of poor relative or absolute performance, the pace of mutual fund redemptions and withdrawals and the loss of institutional and individual separate account clients could accelerate. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on assets under management and revenue.\nIncreased competition from investment managers that charge lower fees may force us to reduce the fees we charge for our services which could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nIncreased competition from investment managers, including passive investment managers, that offer products and services at lower fees has resulted in downward pressure on fees in certain segments of the investment management industry. In order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide clients with investment returns and service that will encourage them to be willing to pay our fees. In the event our competitors charge lower fees for substantially similar products and services, we may be forced to reduce our fees in order to attract and retain clients, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nOur growth may be constrained by the size and number of real estate securities issuers, as well as real estate investment trust ownership restrictions.\nInvestments in real estate securities continue to play an important role in our overall business strategy. Our ability to continue to increase our ownership of real estate securities depends in part on growth in the size and number of issuers in the real estate securities market, particularly in the U.S. Our ability to increase our ownership is also constrained by REIT ownership limits which limit ownership of a REIT\u2019s outstanding capital stock, common stock, and/or preferred stock. Although certain REITs in which we invest have granted us waivers from these ownership limits to allow greater investment, such REITs retain the right to revoke or reduce the waiver limits at any time. As a result of these constraints, we have in the past, and may in the future, be prevented from acquiring new or additional real estate securities, which may impair our ability to increase the assets we manage and our revenue.\nThe inability to access clients through third-party intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn recent years, a significant portion of the growth we have experienced in the assets we manage has been from assets obtained through third-party intermediaries. Our ability to distribute our mutual funds is highly dependent on access to the client bases and product platforms of international, national and regional securities firms, banks, insurance companies, defined contribution plan administrators and other intermediaries which generally offer competing investment products. In addition, our separate account asset management business and subadvisory services depend in part on recommendations by consultants, financial planners and other professional advisers, as well as our existing clients.\nThe structure and terms of the distribution arrangements with intermediaries, including fees paid by us or our mutual funds to intermediaries to assist with distribution efforts and the ability of our mutual funds to participate in these intermediary platforms, are subject to changes driven by market competition and regulatory developments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain access to these channels. Loss of any of these third-party distribution channels, or changes to their structure and terms, or any reduction in our ability to access clients and investors through existing and new distribution channels, could adversely affect our business.\nLimitations on our ability to utilize leverage in the closed-end funds we sponsor could reduce our assets under management and revenue.\nCertain of the closed-end funds sponsored by us utilize leverage in the form of bank financing, which in the aggregate amounted to $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2014. To the extent any closed-end fund sponsored by us elects or is required by regulation or the terms of its bank financing to reduce leverage, such fund may need to liquidate investments. Reducing leverage or liquidation during adverse market conditions could reduce the Company's assets under management and revenue.\nOur financial performance could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur financial performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled personnel. Specifically, our continued ability to compete in our business, to manage our business effectively and to continue to execute our overall strategy depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified portfolio managers, investment analysts, marketing and client services personnel and other key personnel, including our executive officers, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on numerous factors, including without limitation, culture, compensation, career development, the management and leadership of the Company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel for any reason, our performance, including our competitive position, the successful execution of our overall strategy and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFailure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or investment guidelines could result in payments to clients and loss of revenue.\nIn general, when clients retain the Company to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they specify investment guidelines and contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. These investment guidelines and contractual requirements set forth the overall investment objective, performance and reporting obligations, investable securities and the criteria for portfolio management. A failure to comply with these guidelines and/or contractual requirements could result in clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their funds or terminating their agreements with us, which could cause the Company's revenue to decline.\nWe could suffer financial losses in earnings or revenue if our reputation is harmed.\nOur reputation is important to the success of our business. We believe that the Cohen & Steers brand has been, and continues to be, well received both in our industry and with our clients, reflecting the fact that our brand, like our business, is based in part on trust and confidence. Our reputation may be harmed by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, poor investment performance, the dissemination by current or former clients of unfavorable opinions relating to our services, and the imposition of legal or regulatory sanctions or penalties in connection with our business activities. If our reputation is harmed, existing clients may reduce amounts held in, or withdraw entirely from, funds or accounts that we advise, or funds or accounts may terminate their relationship with us, which could reduce our assets under management. In addition, reputational harm may cause us to lose current employees and we may be unable to continue to attract new ones with similar qualifications or skills. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any reputational harm, we may be unsuccessful in repairing any existing harm to our reputation and our future business prospects would likely be affected. The loss of either client relationships or personnel could reduce our assets under management, revenue and earnings.\nSupport provided to new products may reduce fee income, increase expenses and expose us to potential loss on invested capital.\nFrom time to time, we may support the development of new investment products by waiving a portion of the fees we receive for managing such products, by subsidizing expenses or by making seed investments. Seed investments in new products utilize Company capital that would otherwise be available for general corporate purposes. Seed investments may be subject to losses due to market declines. Loss on invested capital used to support new products could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nRegulations restricting the use of commission credits to pay for research could result in increased expenses.\nOn behalf of our clients, we make decisions to buy and sell securities, select broker/dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with these transactions, we may receive commission credits to pay for research from broker/dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. New regulations in and outside the U.S. may restrict or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to use commission credits to pay for research, which could increase our operating expenses.\nThe growth of our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage the costs associated with the implementation of our business strategy.\nOur business strategy continues to involve diversifying our investment management business to include products and services outside investments in U.S. real estate securities. As part of the implementation of our strategy, we have emphasized the development of broader real assets strategies, including commodities and infrastructure, and have expanded our geographical presence outside the U.S. This has entailed hiring additional portfolio managers and additional personnel to support our strategies. As a result, our fixed costs and other expenses have increased as a result of expenses incurred to support the development of new strategies and to enhance our infrastructure, including additional office space, increased travel and additional technology and compliance resources. The success of our business strategy and future growth is contingent upon our ability to continue to support development and implementation of new strategies and products and our ability to successfully manage multiple offices and navigate legal and regulatory systems outside the U.S. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources to adequately support our growth.\nWe could incur financial losses, reputational harm, and regulatory penalties if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information and fail to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities.\nWe are dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer, network and telecommunications systems and the data that reside in or are transmitted through them.\nAs part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected. However, our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access or may be corrupted by cyber attacks, computer viruses or other malicious software code, or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. Although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions by us. Breach of our technology systems could result in the loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents and litigation costs resulting from the incident. Moreover, loss of confidential client identification information could harm our reputation, result in the termination of contracts by our existing clients and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. We do not currently maintain insurance coverage that would cover or limit our out-of-pocket losses related to cyber risks. As such, we would be liable for all losses in connection with a cyber attack.\nFailure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its products.\nSignificant portions of our business operations and those of our critical third-party service providers are concentrated in a few geographic areas, including New York and New Jersey. Critical operations that are geographically concentrated in New York include trading operations, information technology, fund administration, and portfolio accounting services for the Company\u2019s products. Should we, or our critical service providers, experience a significant local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, our ability to remain operational will depend in part on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, network, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. The failure by us, or our critical service providers, to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans, including backup facilities, could impede our ability to operate in the event of a disruption, which could cause our earnings to decline. We have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. In addition, we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster recovery support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If we, or our critical service providers, are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to continue our business operations, which could lead to a damaged reputation and loss of clients resulting in a decrease in assets under management and lower revenues.\nThe failure of a key vendor to fulfill its obligations to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its products.\nWe depend on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of the Company to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the Company and certain of its products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nA majority of our common stock is owned by our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, whose interests may differ from those of other stockholders.\nOur Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owned approximately 52% of our common stock as of February 23, 2015. As long as our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer own a majority of our common stock, they will have the ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nelect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control the management and affairs of the Company;\n\u2022\ndetermine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\npreclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and, consequently, adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on their shares.\nThe interests of our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may differ from those of other stockholders in instances where, for example, management compensation is being determined or where an unsolicited acquisition of us could result in a change in our management. The concentration of beneficial ownership in our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the issuance of additional shares will dilute your percentage ownership in the Company.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 23,613,084 shares of our common stock as of February 23, 2015, may sell shares of our common stock in the open market, subject to any restrictions imposed by U.S. federal securities laws on sales by affiliates.\nIn addition, in connection with our initial public offering in 2004, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain of their affiliates which requires us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), shares of our common stock (and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of common stock) held by them under certain circumstances. In August 2012, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering (i) the resale of an aggregate of 12,000,000 shares owned by our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and (ii) the offer and sale of 10,000,000 shares by us to the public. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC in September 2012. On or prior to expiration of the registration statement in September 2015, we plan to file another registration statement covering the registered shares and may offer these shares to the public. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any additional shares that we issue will dilute your percentage ownership in the Company.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company without negotiating with our board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s securities. Certain of these provisions allow the Company to issue preferred stock with rights more senior to those of the common stock, impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions and set forth rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or other unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess\nacquisition proposals. However, these provisions apply even if an acquisition proposal may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition. In the event that our board of directors determines that a potential business combination transaction would be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders, such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in the Company and the trading price of our common stock could decrease.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the U.S. and internationally.\nOur regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. Future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business or impact our expenses and profitability.\nIn the U.S., regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives have impacted the manner in which Company-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, which has increased the cost of derivatives trading conducted by the Company on behalf of its clients. Compliance with these regulations has required the development and implementation of new mechanisms to monitor compliance with SEC and CFTC rules relating to, among other things, the registration and regulation of CTAs and CPOs, the registration of counterparties that are swap dealers and other counterparties that are major participants in the swap markets, and mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions. The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the CFTC each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds, which could result in additional regulations that limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds.\nIn addition, the Company has begun reporting certain information about its private funds to the SEC and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the CFTC pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies, which have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting. Legislators, regulators, tax authorities and others worldwide continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, marketing activities, the scope of anti-fraud protections and a variety of other matters, which could result in additional compliance costs.\nOutside the U.S., the EC is in the process of formulating rules and regulations under MiFID II and MiFIR. These, together with the changes contemplated by AIFMD, will have direct and indirect effects on our operations in the European Economic Area, including marketing restrictions and increased compliance, disclosure and other obligations, which could impact our ability to expand in these markets.\nThe foregoing regulatory changes and other reforms, including changes to laws affecting the tax status of REITs, could affect our ability to conduct certain business activities.\nOur involvement in legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMany aspects of our business involve risks of legal liability. Various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment related claims. From time to time, we receive subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities and third parties in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. In addition, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages may become subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the applicable fund for any resulting damages.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. We cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nThe tax treatment of certain of our funds involves the interpretation of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no precedent may be available and may be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of our funds depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. U.S. federal income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS\nand the U.S. Department of Treasury, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could cause us to change our investments and commitments, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us and change the character or treatment of portions of our income. In addition, the Company may be required to make certain assumptions when electing a particular tax treatment. However, those assumptions may not be in compliance with all aspects of applicable tax requirements. It is possible that the IRS will assert successfully that the assumptions used by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and/or Treasury Regulations and could require items of income, gain, deductions, loss or credit, including interest deductions, be adjusted, reallocated or disallowed in a manner that adversely affects our clients.", "PERMNO": 90303, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "CNS"}
