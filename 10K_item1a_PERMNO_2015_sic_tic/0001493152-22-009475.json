Risk Factors\nOur business and an investment in our securities are subject to a variety of risks. The following risk factors describe the most significant events, facts or circumstances that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to implement our business plan and the market price for our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that presently are not considered material or are not known to us, and therefore are not mentioned herein, may impair our business operations. Many of these events are outside of our control. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and could continue to cause business disruptions, resulting in a material, adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in various countries. Recently, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, which has spread rapidly to many parts of the world, including the U.S. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The epidemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in the U.S., China and Malaysia.\nIn response to the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company has been following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and retail partners. The Company\u2019s two showrooms and warehouse in Malaysia was closed from March, 2020 to May, 2020. The Los Angeles facility has been closed since March 16, 2020 and reopened in full operation on June 1, 2020. On May 12, 2020, the Company\u2019s Kuala Lumpur office and warehouse reopened for business. However, on August 28, 2020, Malaysia government extended the shutdown order to all business until March 5, 2021. After the re-opening on March 5, 2021, Malaysia government imposed a new nationwide lockdown on May 12, 2021 until early June 2021 which was subsequently extended to early October 2021. In October 2021, the Order was lifted for people who are fully vaccinated and our store is reopened now. In April 2022, Malaysia has reopened the border for foreign visitors. The third-party contract manufacturers that the Company utilizes in China were closed from the end of January 2020 through the beginning of March 2020 and have been open for operation. Certain of the Company\u2019s new products are being sourced from manufacturers in India starting in 2020. The factories in India suspended their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during March through early May 2020. Currently, the factories in China and India are open for operations. Shipping of products from Asia has experienced significant delays since the onset of the pandemic and the costs of shipping from Asia have increased since the onset; and we have experienced and may continue to experience shipping disruptions in the future. Any further impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf temporary closure of offices, stores, showrooms, warehouse, travel restrictions, cancellation of marketing and promotion activities and in person meetings or suspension of transportation, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf our customers may require additional time to pay us or fail to pay us at all, which could significantly increase the amount of accounts receivable and require us to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts. We have experienced and may continue to experience the delay or cancellation of orders from customers, which has and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf our customers that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may reduce their budgets to purchase our products, which may materially adversely impact our revenue;\n\u25cf any disruption of our supply chain, logistics providers, customers or our marketing activities could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including causing our suppliers to cease manufacturing products for a period of time or materially delay delivery to us and customers, which may also lead to loss of customers, as well as reputational, competitive and business harm to us;\n\u25cf many of our customers, distributors, suppliers and other partners are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized, and may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs that we work with cannot weather the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe situation remains highly uncertain for any further outbreak or new variants of the COVID-19 and the timing and effectiveness of any vaccines. It is therefore difficult for the Company to estimate the impact on our business or operating results that might be adversely affected by any further outbreak or new variants of COVID-19. Potential impact to our results of operations will also depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding COVID-19 and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 and/or mitigate its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.\nChanges in economic conditions in the industries and markets served by our customers could adversely affect demand for our products.\nThe furniture industry is subject to cyclical variations in the global economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Our business is affected by the number of orders we are able to secure from our customers, which is determined by the level of our customers\u2019 business activity. Our customers\u2019 level of business activity is in turn determined by the level of consumer spending in the markets our customers serve. Economic downturns could affect discretionary consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for residential and commercial furniture. Any significant or prolonged decline of the economy in U.S., Malaysia, China or other international markets in which our products are sold will affect disposable income and spending by consumers in these markets, and may lead to a decrease in demand for consumer products. To the extent that such decrease in demand for consumer products translates into a decline in the demand for residential and commercial furniture, our sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. Any economic downturn also could negatively impact our primary customers, furniture wholesalers, distributors and retailers, possibly resulting in a decrease in our sales or earnings. Changes in interest rates, consumer confidence, new housing starts, existing home sales, the availability of consumer credit and geopolitical factors could have particularly significant effects on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any decline in economic activity and conditions in the industries and markets served by our customers and in which we operate may reduce demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely impacted the global economy which in turn adversely affected the demand for our products.\nWe historically have derived a substantial part of our sales from a limited number of customers. If we lose any of these customers, or any of these customers reduce the amount of business they do with us, our sales may be adversely affected.\nHistorically, a substantial part of our sales was attributed to a limited number of customers. We had no sales to a customer greater than 10% of our total sales in 2021 and 2020. If the demand for our products decreases in one or more of the markets supplied by our largest customers, or if there are any material social or regulatory changes in these markets, our sales could decline and we could lose market share, any of which could materially harm our business. We do not foresee relying on these same customers for sales generation as we expand our business to increase our internet sales and direct sales to the U.S. and other international markets. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to successfully implement these plans.\nOur decision to move away from low margin products and to eliminate customers who generate low margin sales and that have slow payment histories could result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings.\nAs we implement our plan to transition to high profit margin products and fast paying clients, we cannot assure that the transition will be successful and that we will eventually develop enough new business to make up the loss of sales from the existing low margin products and slow paying clients. If we are unable to develop enough new clients for our high profit margin products, our sales and net income will be negatively impacted.\nIf we lose our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, the quality of our services may decline and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on the expertise, experience and continued services of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, President, Director and Chairperson, Ms. Lam, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Chuang. Loss of their services could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. Ms. Lam and Mr. Chuang are key factors in our success at establishing relationships within the furniture industry in the U.S. and international market and capital market because of their extensive industry and financial experience. The continued development of our business depends upon their continued employment. We have entered into employment agreements with Ms. Lam and Mr. Chuang that include provisions for non-competition and confidentiality.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain key employees and our ability to attract and retain other skilled personnel. We cannot guarantee that any employee will remain employed by us for any period of time or that we will be able to attract, train or retain qualified personnel in the future. Such loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and company. Furthermore, we will need to employ additional personnel to expand our business. Qualified employees are in great demand and may be unavailable in the time frame required to satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements. There is no assurance we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees in the future. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive rates could impair the growth of our business.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with competition in our industry, which could adversely affect our market share and result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings.\nThe furniture industries in the U.S. and international markets are very competitive and fragmented. Our business is subject to risks associated with competition from new or existing industry participants who may have more resources and better access to capital. Many of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and government support, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. Among other things, these industry participants compete with us based upon price, quality, style, functionality and availability. We cannot be sure we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future. Some of our competitors may also be able to provide customers with additional benefits at lower overall costs to increase market share. We cannot be sure we will be able to match cost reductions by our competitors or that we will be able to succeed in the face of current or future competition. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through value, styling or functionality from those of our competitors. In addition, some of our customers are also performing more manufacturing services themselves. We may face competition from our customers as they seek to become more vertically integrated. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings.\nWe will face different market dynamics and competition as we develop new products to expand our presence in our target markets. In some markets, our future competitors may have greater brand recognition and broader distribution than we currently enjoy. We may not be as successful as our competitors in generating revenues in those markets due to the lack of recognition of our brands, lack of customer acceptance, lack of product quality history and other factors. As a result, any new expansion efforts could be more costly and less profitable than our efforts in our existing markets. If we are not as successful as our competitors are in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could be impacted negatively and we could lose market share, any of which could materially harm our business.\nWe may lose U.S. market share due to competition and our dependence on production facilities located outside the U.S., which would result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings.\nWe compete in the U.S. market principally through our sales under the Diamond Sofa brand. The furniture industry in the U.S. is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with many domestic U.S. and international furniture sources, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and retailers marketing products through catalogs and over the internet. There are few barriers to entry in the U.S. furniture market, and new competitors may enter this market at any time. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised and well-recognized branded products. We may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures in the U.S. market. We also may not be able to continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors in the U.S. through value, styling and functionality because of the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings. Furthermore, some large furniture retailers in the U.S. are sourcing products directly from furniture manufacturers located in China and other Southeast Asian countries instead of through distributors like us. Over time, this practice may expand to smaller retailers in the U.S. Accordingly, we are continually subject to the risk of losing U.S. market share, which may decrease our future sales and earnings. Because we source products from third party manufacturers that are located outside the U.S. and we are subject to risks caused by disruption of international transportation such as COVID-19 and other health pandemics as well as the increase of tariffs imposed by the U.S. customs. We might loss business and our reputation might be damaged if there is delay of delivery and shipment from our suppliers.\nFailure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer preferences could adversely impact our business.\nFurniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles. We believe our past performance has been based on, and our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop, market and produce new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in introducing, marketing and producing any new products or product innovations, or that we will develop and introduce in a timely manner innovations in our existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Our success also depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends related to residential and commercial furniture. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales could decline and we could lose market share, any of which could materially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, we may not be profitable.\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage and expand our operations and facilities in the face of continued growth. This planned growth includes the expansion of our internet sales and diversifying our international sales by expanding our broad network of distributors, increasing direct sales in the U.S. and other international markets and entering emerging growth markets. The growth in our operations has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results. To manage this growth effectively, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fulfill our staffing requirements for our business, successfully train and assimilate new employees, or expand our management base and enhance our operating and financial systems. Failure to achieve any of these goals will prevent us from managing our growth in an effective manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan and fund operations and may not be able to obtain such capital on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn connection with the development and expansion of our business, we may incur significant capital and operational expenses. We believe that we can increase our sales and net income by implementing a growth strategy that focuses on (i) increasing online sales and (ii) diversifying our international sales. We plan to increase and diversify our sales to the U.S. and international markets by establishing new brands for the international markets and to increase our online sales presence.\nIn the event that available funds are not sufficient to meet our operating needs and our plans for expansion, we intend to pursue alternative financing arrangements, including additional bank loans based on our good credit rating or funds raised through additional offerings of our equity or debt, if and when we determine such offerings are required. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf Investors\u2019 perceptions of, and demand for, companies in our industry;\n\u25cf Investors\u2019 perceptions of, and demand for, companies sourcing from China and other Asian countries;\n\u25cf Conditions of the U.S. and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds;\n\u25cf Our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;\n\u25cf Governmental regulation of foreign investment in companies in particular countries;\n\u25cf Economic, political and other conditions in the U.S., China, and other countries; and\n\u25cf Governmental policies relating to foreign currency.\nThere is no assurance we will be successful in locating a suitable financing transaction in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, there is no assurance we will obtain the capital we require by any other means. Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly-issued securities may include preferences or superior voting rights, be combined with the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, or be the issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have additional dilutive effects. Furthermore, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition. If we cannot raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to carry out all or parts of our strategy to maintain our growth and competitiveness.\nA substantial portion of our inventory has moved slowly in terms of utilization due to the stay home and store closure orders, delay of shipments and suspension of transportations caused by COVID-19, which has caused and might continue to cause negative impacts on our cash flow, liquidity and financial results.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, our showrooms and stores were closed and freight transportation of products from our international suppliers has been delayed or suspended, and a substantial portion of our inventory has moved slowly in terms of utilization. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has written-down $39.97 million of slow-moving inventory, mostly Jade Mats in Malaysia due to the extension of Movement Control Order by Malaysia government which prohibits the businesses from opening to public to control the spread of COVID-19. While our showroom and stores in Malaysia reopened since October 2021, though we cannot offer any assurances they will not be closed again if there is any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19 and further closure order from local government. If we have to write down more inventory, our cash flow, liquidity and financial results will be materially adversely affected.\nWe may experience material disruptions to our ability to acquire sufficient inventory from third-party suppliers that could result in material delays, quality control issues, increased costs and loss of business opportunities, which may negatively impact our sales and financial results.\nWe rely upon our third-party suppliers to produce our products and maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. A material disruption at our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and negatively impact our financial results. We may also experience quality control issues as we seek out new suppliers or are forced to contract with new suppliers to meet customer demand. Any such material disruption may prevent us from shipping our products on a timely basis, reduce our sales and market share and negatively impact our financial results. Our third-party supplier contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current relationships with these parties or, if necessary, establish future arrangements with other third-party suppliers on commercially reasonable terms. Further, while we maintain an active quality control program, we cannot assure that their manufacturing and quality control processes will be maintained at a level sufficient to meet our inventory needs or prevent the inadvertent sale of substandard products. While we believe that products manufactured by our current third-party suppliers could generally be procured from alternative sources, temporary or permanent loss of services from a significant manufacturer could cause disruption in our supply chain and operations.\nOur dependence on foreign suppliers and our increased global operations subject us to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could impact our operations and financial results.\nIn 2021, the majority of our products were purchased from foreign suppliers and manufacturers, predominantly in Asia. Our dependence on foreign suppliers means that we may be affected by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. For example, any upward valuation in the Chinese yuan or any other foreign currency against the U.S. dollar may result in higher costs to us for those goods. Declines in foreign currencies and currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of one or more of our foreign suppliers. This, in turn, might cause such foreign vendors to demand higher prices for products in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation, delay product shipments to us, or discontinue selling to us, any of which could ultimately reduce our sales or increase our costs.\nWe, and our foreign suppliers, are also subject to other risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions worldwide. These risks and uncertainties include import duties and quotas, compliance with anti-dumping regulations, port congestion, supply chain disruption, work stoppages, economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including inflation and recession), government regulations, employment and labor matters, wars and fears of war, political unrest, natural disasters, public health issues, regulations to address climate change and other trade restrictions. We cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our raw materials or products are sourced, or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future, will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments or the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign suppliers, including labor disputes resulting in work disruption, the imposition of additional import restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and/or increased tariffs or quotas, or both, could increase the cost, reduce the supply of merchandise available to us, or result in excess inventory if merchandise is received after the planned or appropriate selling season, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA delay in getting non-U.S.-sourced products through port operations and customs in a timely manner could result in reduced sales, canceled sales orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation.\nOur business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. As a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide. Supply chain disruption and port congestions caused by COVID-19 have caused delay of shipment and delivery of our products. Any disruptions at ports create significant risks for our business, particularly if work slowdowns, quarantines, lockdowns, strikes or other disruptions occur during our peak importing seasons. Any of these factors could result in reduced sales, canceled sales orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws that apply to our business could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively considering changes to existing tax laws.\nIn October 2018, the Macao Legislative Assembly has approved a bill revoking the current offshore law, to abolish the relevant legislation on the Macao offshore business regime. Starting on January 1, 2021, the exemptions of stamp duty, professional tax (for individuals) and complementary tax (for corporations) will no longer be available to these offshore institutions. On October 14, 2020, the Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Institute approved that Nova Macao\u2019s offshore license became invalid under the order of Repeal of Legal Regime of the Offshore Services by Macao Special Administrative Region. Nova Macao was de-registered and liquidated in January 2021 and its business was taken over by Nova HK. In February 2022, Nova HK also entered into a de-registration and liquidation process and is in the process of transferring all its assets and business to Nova Malaysia. All of Nova HK\u2019s inventory was transferred to Nova Malaysia on February 15, 2022.\nAdditional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in connection with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries.\nWe are subject to warranty claims for our products, which could result in unexpected expense.\nMany of our products carry warranties for defects in quality and workmanship. Historically, the amount for return of products, the discount provided to the customers due to defects and cost for the replacement parts has been immaterial. However, we may experience significant expense as the result of future product quality issues, product recalls or product liability claims which may have a material adverse effect on our business. The actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed our expectations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation, product liability risk and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources.\nFrom time to time, we may be a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation, regardless of its merits, could divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and may result in substantial legal costs. The Company has been named in a putative securities class action case and two derivatives cases described in Item 3 below. While the Company believes it has adequate defenses, the defense of those cases could become costly and could significantly divert management attention from its business.\nWe may not be able to protect our product designs and other proprietary rights adequately, which could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce the value of our products and brands, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.\nWe attempt to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative brands and product designs and functionality. As a result, our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important assets to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and protect our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties in China, the U.S. and other international markets. Despite our efforts, any of the following may reduce the value of our owned and used intellectual property:\n\u25cf Issued and trademarks that we own or have the right to use may not provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u25cf Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our intellectual property or that of those from whom we license our rights to use;\n\u25cf Our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we use or develop; or\n\u25cf Another party may obtain a blocking patent and we or our licensors would need to either obtain a license or design around the patent in order to continue to offer the contested feature or service in our products.\nEffective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in China or certain other countries. Policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation might be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly and may divert our management\u2019s attention away from our core business. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that litigation would result in an outcome favorable to us. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, it would have a negative impact on our operations.\nWe, or the owners of the intellectual property rights licensed to us, may be subject to claims that we or such licensors have infringed the proprietary rights of others, which could require us and our licensors to obtain a license or change designs.\nAlthough we do not believe any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, there is no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or those from whom we have licenses or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be asserted successfully, defending against such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our other activities. In addition, assertion of infringement claims could result in injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products. If any claims or actions are asserted against us or those from whom we have licenses, we may seek to obtain a license to the intellectual property rights that are in dispute. Such a license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, which could force us to change our designs.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of our operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with the regulatory requirements placed on a public company.\nAs a public company with substantial operations, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The costs of preparing and filing annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to shareholders is time-consuming and costly.\nIt has also been time-consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and this remains an ongoing process. Certain members of our management have limited or no experience operating a company whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or with the rules and reporting practices required by the federal securities laws as applied to a publicly traded company. We have needed to recruit, hire, train and retain additional financial reporting, internal control and other personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures.\nOur ongoing investment in new products is inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new products. Our plan to market and sell high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats for use in therapy clinics, hospitality, and real estate projects in Malaysia and other regions in Southeast Asia is a reflection of our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide useful products in new geographical markets. Such endeavors including the investment of jade mats in Malaysia involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, distraction of management from current operations, and risks and competition not discovered in our due diligence and decision making of such strategy plans could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because the development and investment in new products and markets are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such plans will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and to comply with other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC. Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all possible errors. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and subject to simple error or mistake. Furthermore, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, measures of control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nWe are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our wholly owned subsidiaries to meet our obligations, and any inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends or make other payments to us when needed could disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Diamond Bar, Nova Furniture, Nova Samoa and their subsidiaries. We rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay us dividends and make other payments to us when needed because of regulatory restrictions or otherwise, we may be materially and adversely limited in our ability to make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nWe may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms because we became public by means of a share exchange, which could limit our ability to obtain future capital and financing.\nThere may be risks associated with our becoming public by means of a share exchange, or reverse merger with a public shell company that had no revenues, operations or material assets prior to the time of the share exchange. Analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage for our company because there is no incentive for brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. Furthermore, we can give no assurance that brokerage firms will, in the future, want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf, which could limit our ability to obtain future capital and financing.\nThe audit report included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC is prepared by auditors who are not inspected fully by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), and as such, investors are deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur auditor, Centurion ZD CPA & Co., is required to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB as an auditor of companies that are publicly traded in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB. However, because our auditor is based in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval, our auditor and its audit work are not currently able to be inspected independently and fully by the PCAOB.\nInspections of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside Hong Kong have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor\u2019s audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections and may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCA Act, was enacted on December 18, 2020. In accordance with the HFCA Act, trading in securities of any registrant on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States may be prohibited if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate the registrant\u2019s auditor for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, and, as a result, an exchange may determine to delist the securities of such registrant. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cAHFCA Act\u201d), which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted if our auditor is unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement.\nOn December 2, 2021, SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCA Act. The rules apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate (the \u201cCommission-Identified Issuers\u201d). A Commission-Identified Issuer will be required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified. If a registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued its determinations (the \u201cDetermination\u201d) that they are unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong. The Determination includes lists of public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely. Our auditor, Centurion ZD CPA & Co. is headquartered in Hong Kong and is included in the PCAOB Determinations.\nOn February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022 (the \u201cAmerica COMPETES Act\u201d). If the America COMPETES Act is enacted into law, it would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.\nAs a result, we will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in our annual report filing covering the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and our securities may be prohibited from trading on Nasdaq or another U.S. stock exchange if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years as specified in the HFCA Act, or two-year if AHFCA Act or America COMPETES Act is enacted into law, and this ultimately could result in our shares of common stock being delisted from Nasdaq. The market price of our shares could be materially adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of these actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment towards, companies whose auditors are not inspected fully by the PCAOB, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nAs our international business has expanded, we have sourced more products manufactured outside of China. We are evaluating, designing, and implementing additional processes and control changes to meet the requirements of the HFCA Act, which we believe will enable us to engage an independent registered public accounting firm that satisfies the PCAOB inspection requirements for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, subject to compliance with SEC and other requirements. However, these efforts may not be sufficient, or may take time for us to implement and ultimately may not be successful. We may also be subject to enforcement under the HFCA Act, the rules implementing the HFCA Act that are adopted by the SEC, and any other similar legislation that may be enacted into law or executive orders that may be adopted in the future. If we failed to comply with those rules, our shares of common stock will be delisted. If our shares of common stock are unable to be listed on another securities exchange, such a delisting would substantially impair our shareholders ability to sell or purchase their shares when they wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our shares of common stock. Further, new laws and regulations or changes in laws and regulations in both the United States, China and Hong Kong could affect our ability to list our shares on Nasdaq, which could materially impair the market for and market price for our shares.\nIf relations between the U.S. and China worsen, our business could be adversely affected as we have to find new suppliers and manufacturers out of China.\nPolitical tensions between the United States and China have escalated due to, among other things, trade disputes, the COVID-19 outbreak, sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury on certain officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the central government of the PRC and the executive orders issued by then U.S. President in August 2020 that prohibit certain transactions with certain Chinese companies and their applications. Rising political tensions could reduce levels of trades, investments, technological exchanges and other economic activities between the two major economies, which would have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. These controversies also could make it more difficult for us to provide our products to our customers in the U.S. and China. The international trade policies of China and the U.S. could adversely affect our business, and the imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports from China, including those applied specifically to furniture products, or the imposition of taxes, import duties or other charges on exports to the U.S. could increase our costs and decrease our earnings. Due to an increase in tariffs imposed by the U.S., some customers are seeking alternative resources instead of China, which has negatively affected the purchase orders and our sales as we mainly resource our products from China. In order to avoid these new tariffs, the market has shifted towards an uncertain era. The Company started to source certain of its new products from manufacturers in India in 2020. Sales during this stage may also be impacted by this shift in behavior. The U.S. government currently has increased tariffs from 10% to 25%. During this time period our company will continue to seek alternatives and new resources to increase the revenue. If and to the extent we are not able to mitigate the effects of such trade or tariff policies, our operations may be adversely affected.\nOur compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may put us at a competitive disadvantage, while our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may result in substantial penalties.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties. Non-U.S. companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to the provisions of the FCPA. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in mainland China and other Asian countries that we conduct business. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur shares may be delisted under the HFCA Act as the PCAOB is unable to inspect our auditor with presence in Hong Kong, and the delisting of our shares, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCA Act states if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit our shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the United States. Our financial statements contained in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been audited by Centurion ZD CPA & Co., an independent registered public accounting firm that is headquartered in Hong Kong. Centurion ZD CPA & Co., is a firm registered with the PCAOB, and is required by the laws of the U.S. to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the U.S. and professional standards. However, because our auditor is based in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval, our auditor and its audit work are not currently able to be inspected independently and fully by the PCAOB.\nOn December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued its determinations (the \u201cDetermination\u201d) that they are unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong. The Determination includes lists of public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely. Our auditor Centurion ZD CPA & Co. is subject to the Determination list.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments implementing the disclosure and submission requirements of the HFCA Act. In addition, the adopting release establishes the SEC\u2019s procedures for (i) determining whether an issuer is a \u201cCommission-Identified Issuer\u201d under the HFCA Act and (ii) prohibiting the trading of a Commission-Identified Issuer\u2019s securities. A \u201cCommission-Identified Issuer\u201d is an issuer identified by the SEC as having filed an annual report containing an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction (PCAOB-Identified Firm). The SEC will identify such issuers promptly after the filing of their annual report by evaluating (via Inline XBRL tagging or other structured data) whether the issuer\u2019s annual report contains an audit report signed by a PCAOB-Identified Firm. The SEC will then \u201cprovisionally identify\u201d the issuer as a Commission-Identified Issuer on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov/HFCAA. Provisionally identified issuers will have 15 business days to email the SEC to dispute the identification, after which the determination becomes conclusive. The earliest that the SEC could identify a Commission-Identified Issuer would be after companies file their annual reports for 2021 (i.e., spring 2022 for calendar-year issuers). The SEC will impose an initial trading prohibition on an issuer as soon as practicable after the issuer is conclusively identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years. The prohibition will apply to trading on a national securities exchange and in the over-the-counter market. The earliest any trading prohibitions would apply to any issuer would be in 2024, once an issuer has been a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years (2022, 2023 and 2024).\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted if our auditor is unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement.\nOn February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022 (the \u201cAmerica COMPETES Act\u201d). If the America COMPETES Act is enacted into law, it would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.\nBecause our auditor Centurion ZD CPA & Co. is on the Determination list that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor, it could cause the trading in our securities to be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and as a result Nasdaq may delist our securities. If our securities are unable to be listed on another securities exchange, such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our securities when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our ordinary shares. Further, new laws and regulations or changes in laws and regulations could affect our ability to list our securities on Nasdaq, which could materially impair the market for and market price for our securities\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, which could make it more difficult or impossible for an investor to sell our common stock for a positive return on their investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other companies in our industry, announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, product improvements, commercial relationships, intellectual property, legal, regulatory or other business developments and changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for companies that became public by means of a reverse acquisition with a public shell company in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. Furthermore, the market for our common stock historically has been limited and we cannot assure you that a larger market will ever be developed or maintained. Market fluctuations and volatility, as well as general economic, market and political conditions, could reduce our market price. As a result, these factors may make it more difficult or impossible for you to sell our common stock for a positive return on your investment.\nShares of our common stock lack a significant trading market, which could make it more difficult for an investor to sell our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. However, there is no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will be sustained. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock.\nIf we fail to continue to meet the listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on NASDAQ. In particular, NASDAQ rules require us to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. The Company was notified on January 18, 2019 that pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), it was afforded 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and was also provided an additional 180 days grace period. On December 18, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada with an effective date of December 20, 2019 to effect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of the Company\u2019s common stock to meet the $1.00 per share minimum closing bid price requirement. On January 9, 2020, we received a written notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications Staff indicating that the Company has regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable NASDAQ listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by our shareholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our stock. As of March 16, 2022, Steven Qiang Liu, our largest shareholder and vice president of the Company, owned approximately 29% of our outstanding shares of common stock. If Mr. Liu sells a large number of shares, or if we issue a large number of shares, the market price of our stock could decline. Moreover, the perception in the public market that significant shareholders might sell shares of our stock could depress the market for our shares. If such shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, such sales could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang,\u201d in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or debt securities to raise capital or complete acquisitions, which would reduce the equity interest of our shareholders.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2021, there were 8,163,258 authorized and unissued shares of our common stock available for future issuance, based on 6,836,742 shares of our common stock outstanding. Although we have no commitments as of the date of this report to issue our securities, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock or debt securities to complete a business combination or to raise capital. On October 8, 2020, we renewed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under which we may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $60,000,000. The shelf registration statement was declared effective as of October 15, 2020. On July 23, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors for the sale by the Company of 1,114,508 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), at a purchase price of $2.80 per share. Concurrently with the sale of the Common Shares, the Company also sold warrants to purchase 1,114,508 shares of Common Stock. The Common Shares were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and the Warrants and the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants were sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The gross proceeds of the offering were $3,120,622 before deducting placement agent\u2019s commissions and other offering costs, and the net proceeds of the offering were approximately $2,760,000. The offering closed on July 27, 2021.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock may significantly reduce the equity interest of our existing shareholders and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our wholly owned subsidiaries to meet our obligations, and any inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends or make other payments to us when needed could disrupt or have a negative impact on our business. Our management intends to follow a policy of retaining all of our earnings to finance the development and execution of our strategy and the expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will occur only if our stock price appreciates.\nOur principal shareholders have the ability to exert significant control in matters requiring a shareholder vote and could delay, deter or prevent a change of control in our company.\nAs of March 16, 2022, Steven Qiang Liu, our largest shareholder, owned approximately 29% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Mr. Liu may exert significant influence over us, giving him the ability, among other things, to exercise significant control over the election of all or a majority of the Board of Directors and to approve significant corporate transactions that require the shareholders\u2019 approval. Such share ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. Without the consent of Mr. Liu, we could be prevented from entering into potentially beneficial transactions if such transactions conflict with our principal shareholder\u2019s interests. As an officer of the Company, Mr. Liu owes a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our shareholders. As a shareholder, Mr. Liu is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our shareholders.\nProvisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.\nMembers of our Board of Directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Amended and Restated Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their duty of care. In addition, our Amended and Restated Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nShort sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. Since it is in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. On December 21, 2018, Seeking Alpha published a report that contained various false allegations against the Company, which has driven down the market price of our common stock. The author of that article disclosed that he had accumulated a short position in the Company\u2019s common stock prior to the publication of the article. As of December 31, 2018, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market was $2.30, representing a decrease of $1.55 compared to $3.85, the closing price of our common stock as of December 20, 2018.\nAlthough we have timely responded to the false allegations set forth in the Seeking Alpha article, we cannot assure you that false, misleading and/or defamatory articles will not be published again in the future. The publication of any such commentary regarding us in the future may bring about a temporary, or long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. No assurances can be made that similar declines in the market price of our common stock will not occur in the future, in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 14435, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "NVFY"}
