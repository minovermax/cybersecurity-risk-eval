{"cik": "1142701", "company": "UNITED ONLINE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContent & Media Segment\nSocial Networking Services\nOur Content & Media segment provides social networking services and products under the Classmates, StayFriends, and Trombi brands. We operate our social networking services as a platform to enable users to locate and interact with acquaintances from their past, with high school affiliations as the primary focus. Our domestic and international social networking services comprise a large and diverse population of users, with approximately 100 million registered accounts at December 31, 2014. We also provide advertising opportunities to marketers with both brand and direct response objectives through a full suite of display, search, email, and text-link opportunities across our various properties. Our social networking products primarily consist of yearbooks and yearbook reprints.\nOur domestic Classmates service, which launched in 1995 as one of the first social networking services, is designed to assist members in finding friends and acquaintances primarily from high school. Our domestic Classmates website (www.classmates.com) primarily serves the U.S. and Canada. Over the years, Classmates members have contributed a substantial amount of distinct, relevant pieces of user-generated content, such as names, high school affiliations, biographies, interests, and photos. We believe our large membership base and the user-generated content posted on the Classmates website assist us in attracting new members and bringing existing members back to the website on a recurring basis. One content feature targeted at our large base of registered consumers age 35 and over, who joined Classmates to reconnect with important memories from their past, are our digitized versions of high school yearbooks. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 280,000 digitized high school yearbooks available on the website, representing what we believe is the largest digitized yearbook\ncollection available anywhere on the Internet. Visitors to the website can interact with yearbooks, which can facilitate new forms of social connections, such as sharing memorable content with friends and acquaintances or posting comments on the Classmates website or on Facebook. In addition, members can tag photos directly in the digitized yearbook collection, search for individuals, and view an index of all members appearing in the yearbooks. Members and visitors may also purchase a copy of many of the yearbooks available on the Classmates website. Seasonality has historically not had a material impact on our social networking revenues.\nDomestic. Visitors to the Classmates website can experience a substantial amount of content free of charge. Members with free accounts can use our search feature to locate individuals in our database or in our collection of yearbooks; post information and view information posted by other members; tag yearbook photos; and organize reunions and engage in other reunion-related activities. To engage in the premium features, a member is required to purchase a paid subscription, which is generally available for terms ranging from three months to two years. Revenues from our Classmates website are derived primarily from the sale of these subscriptions and, to a lesser extent, from advertising fees and other transactions on our website, including the sale of yearbooks and yearbook reprints.\nPaid subscription holders have access to a variety of premium features. We expect the features available to free users and paid subscription holders to continue to change from time to time. Premium features currently include, among others:\n\u2022 Access to our Classmates\u00ae Guestbook, which alerts members when another member visits his or her Classmates profile, unless the visiting member makes the profile selection not to leave his or her name.\n\u2022 Ability to send emails through our Classmates website to other members and respond to email messages from any other member, regardless of whether the sender is a free member or a paying member.\n\u2022 Access to our Classmates Who Remembers You feature that alerts members when another member has remembered them and how they were remembered (e.g., funny, smart, cool, gutsy, etc.).\nInternational. In addition to our Classmates website, we operate five international websites that offer social networking services, primarily as a social networking platform to reconnect with friends and acquaintances from high school. We operate StayFriends in Germany, Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland (www.stayfriends.de, www.stayfriends.se, www.stayfriends.at, and www.stayfriends.ch, respectively), and Trombi in France (www.trombi.com). Similar to the Classmates website, each international website includes free and paid memberships.\nIndustry Background-The Internet continues to evolve and grow as a platform to enable, among other things, social interaction, consumer engagement, the sale of goods and services, and advertising. We believe that as people age, many develop a strong interest in reconnecting with people and events from their past.\nThe number of Internet users age 35 and older is expected to increase from 124.9 million in 2012 to 138.8 million in 2016, according to 2012 forecasts by eMarketer, a market research firm. Community affiliations based on schools attended encompass a particularly large population of individuals. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2013, there were approximately 207 million high school graduates living in the U.S. and approximately 137 million people living in the U.S. who had attended college. We believe that the occurrence of class reunions among this large population frequently strengthens an individual's curiosity and nostalgic feelings about school memories, friends and acquaintances, and popular culture during such individual's years in high school and college.\nCompetition-As consumers continue to spend more time and money online, the competition for their time and engagement has continued to intensify. Consumers have a great number of options for online content and entertainment, including, by way of example, games, websites offering news and current events, movies, television shows, videos, information about any and virtually every topic, and the opportunity to communicate, socialize and interact with acquaintances and others. Facebook, in particular, has become a dominant platform for finding and interacting with people online, including both past and present acquaintances. Our services continue to provide a platform for social networking activities and communications, especially related to the high school experience. Visitors to the Classmates website can interact with yearbooks, which can facilitate new forms of social connections, such as sharing memorable content with friends and acquaintances or posting comments on the Classmates website or on Facebook. Certain aspects of the value proposition of our social networking services compete with major social networking platforms such as Facebook, as well as Internet search engines such as Google. Many of our competitors offer their content and services free of charge. We believe the primary competitive factors are price, features, functionality, size and engagement of the user base, and quantity, quality and scope of the content. We believe we compete favorably with respect to certain of these areas, although many competitors have a significant advantage over us in certain other areas. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors\", which appears in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLoyalty Marketing\nOur Content & Media segment also offers a loyalty marketing service under the MyPoints brand. MyPoints connects advertisers with its members by allowing members to earn rewards points for engaging in online and offline activities. MyPoints is a free service for consumers who register and provide certain identifying information to receive direct email marketing and other loyalty promotions. Members earn points for responding to email offers, shopping online at the MyPoints website (www.mypoints.com), taking market research companies' surveys, playing online games with MyPoints partners, searching the Internet on a dedicated MyPoints' landing page and using the MyPoints-branded browser extension as a reminder service for members to shop and earn. In addition to these point earning opportunities, MyPoints also offers a credit card with the ability to earn points through both online and offline shopping. Reward points can be earned from over 1,500 affiliated retailers, which are redeemable for third-party gift cards and electronic gift cards currently from over 75 merchants or for PayPal credit, as well as the option to redeem in the form of a charitable donation. Gift cards are also available for purchase on the MyPoints website.\nMyPoints provides advertisers with an effective means to reach a large online audience. MyPoints uses a variety of criteria, including personal interests, purchasing behavior and demographic profiles, to create targeted promotions for advertisers. These marketing campaigns are tailored to meet the goals of the specific advertiser, which are most commonly to generate incremental sales of an advertiser's products or services but may also include objectives that do not involve purchase transactions, such as generating sales leads or increased traffic to an advertiser's website. In many cases, MyPoints sends personalized email marketing messages, called BonusMail\u00ae, that are directed specifically to individual MyPoints members to showcase a single advertiser or offer. MyPoints members benefit not only from attractive discounts and other benefits featured in BonusMail\u00ae offers but also can receive points for purchases and, in some cases, for clicking through the media links in BonusMail\u00ae to the advertiser's website, as well as for other actions taken within a limited time period. We believe the limited-time nature of the BonusMail\u00ae offers adds a sense of urgency to the promotion for the consumer.\nThe advertising revenues generated from our loyalty marketing service revenues are classified as advertising and other revenues. Advertisers pay us primarily based on performance measures that include when our MyPoints emails are transmitted to members, when members respond to emails and when members complete transactions. Advertising and other revenues also include revenues generated\nfrom the sale of gift cards. Loyalty marketing advertising revenues and operating results tend to be higher in the quarter ending December 31 when compared to other quarters, though there can be no assurance that these seasonal trends will continue in the future.\nIndustry Background-U.S. online retail sales are expected to grow from $263 billion in 2013 to $414 billion in 2018, a compound annual growth rate of 9.5%, according to an online retail sales forecast from Forrester Research Inc. In addition, U.S. advertisers' spending on digital advertising is expected to grow from $57 billion in 2014 to $103 billion in 2019 representing 36% of all ad spending, according to Forrester's latest estimates based on its ForecastView model. As advertisers seek methods to target, reach and retain online consumers, loyalty marketing presents an attractive option.\nAccording to the 2013 Colloquy Loyalty Census, total loyalty memberships in the U.S. grew from 973 million in 2000 to over 2.65 billion in 2012. This confluence of growth in online shopping and advertising, and in loyalty memberships offers significant opportunities for MyPoints as our loyalty marketing business is poised to realize its potential by exploiting current assets including: strong relationships with a variety of retailers and clients, a large and engaged member base, a variety of engagement activities to serve member needs and interests, and the ability to provide loyalty incentives to drive consumer action. Loyalty marketing programs are generally designed to reward consumers with points that accumulate based on their activities and which may be redeemed for cash, gift cards, or products and services from participating vendors. Some loyalty marketing programs use points as an incentive for members to opt in to receiving certain email offers or to update their personal interest profiles, which provide useful information that helps advertisers target consumers interested in purchasing the advertisers' products and services. While these programs have long been popular with airlines, credit card vendors, hotels, and retailers, in recent years, loyalty marketing programs have expanded into a comprehensive direct marketing and targeted advertising strategy for companies in a wide range of industries.\nLoyalty marketing programs and similar services enable advertisers to target consumers in ways that are generally impractical with traditional offline direct marketing channels. Loyalty marketing programs can also easily measure click- through rates on display advertising and response rates to email campaigns, providing rapid feedback for advertisers that can be used to identify potential customers and create new targeted offers. In addition, a loyalty marketing program that has attracted a large, responsive and loyal member base helps to improve returns on advertisers' marketing investments. Furthermore, advertisers may prefer to work with loyalty marketing programs that offer performance-based pricing, which helps advertisers achieve specific performance objectives within budget.\nCompetition-The market for loyalty marketing services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to significantly increase in the future as loyalty marketing programs continue to grow in popularity and expand to mobile platforms. Our MyPoints loyalty marketing business faces competition for members from other online loyalty marketing programs, such as Ebates and Mr. Rebates, as well as offline loyalty marketing programs that have a significant online presence, such as those operated by credit card, airline and hotel companies. In addition, we also face competition for members from online providers of discounted offerings and coupons, such as Groupon and LivingSocial. We believe the primary competitive factors in the loyalty marketing industry are the number, type and popularity of the participating merchants, the attractiveness of the rewards offered, the value awarded for various actions, the ease and speed of earning rewards, and the ability to offer members a robust, user-friendly shopping experience. We believe that we compete favorably in many of these areas, although some of our competitors have an advantage over us in some or all of these areas. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors\", which appears in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor additional information regarding our segments, see Note 2, \"Segment Information\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTechnology\nEach of our services, including our social networking services, our loyalty marketing service, our Internet access service, and our voice service operates on a separate and distinct technology platform. Each of our services is generally provided through a combination of internally-developed and third-party software, industry standard hardware and outsourced network services. We maintain the web properties that power these services. We also have developed software to enhance the functionality of certain components of our services, including connectivity, web services, billing, email, customer support, data analysis, customer loyalty applications, and targeted advertising. We maintain data centers in multiple locations in the U.S. and Europe. In many cases, we have redundant systems to provide high levels of service availability and connectivity. We host the majority of our data center services in outsourced, third-party co-location facilities and we outsource all of our bandwidth and managed modem services.\nWe license from third parties a number of our software applications and components, including applications for our billing, customer support, advertising, and database systems, our client and server applications, and portions of our dial-up Internet access accelerator services. These licenses generally have terms ranging from a year to perpetual.\nCustomer Support and Retention\nWe believe reliable customer service and technical support are important to retaining our customers. Our businesses generally offer a variety of online and offline tools designed to provide solutions and answers to frequently asked questions. These tools are also designed to assist our members and customers in verifying and updating their account information. In addition, we offer traditional email support and certain of our services provide live telephone support as well.\nOur customer relationship management and support infrastructure includes employees at our facilities in Woodland Hills, California; Hyderabad, India; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; Schaumburg, Illinois; and Berlin, Germany. We also outsource to third parties substantially all of our telephone and email customer support for our Communications services, and a portion of our email customer support for MyPoints services. We monitor the effectiveness of our customer support functions and measure performance metrics such as average hold time and first call resolution and abandonment rates. Communications with our customers are logged and categorized to enable us to recognize and act on trends.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to a number of international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to taxation, bulk email or \"spam,\" advertising, user privacy and data protection, consumer protection, antitrust, export, and unclaimed property. In addition, proposed laws and regulations relating to some or all of the foregoing, as well as to other areas affecting our businesses, are continuously debated and considered for adoption in the U.S. and other countries, and such laws and regulations could be adopted in the future. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors,\" which appears in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProprietary Rights\nOur trade names, trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, and other intellectual property are important to the success of our businesses. In particular, we view our primary trademarks as critical to our success. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, domain name, and contract laws to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We continuously assess whether to seek patent and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of our businesses and technologies that we believe constitute innovations providing competitive\nadvantages. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to, and distribution of, our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. We consider our trademarks, including our United Online, Classmates, NetZero, Juno, StayFriends, and MyPoints trademarks, to be very valuable assets, and most of these trademarks have been registered in the U.S. or, in certain cases, in other countries.\nInternational Operations\nWe have international operations in India and Germany. Our operations in India primarily handle software development and operations, quality assurance and email customer support. Our operations in Germany provide social networking services in Germany, Sweden, France, Austria, and Switzerland. We do not generate revenues directly from our operations in India.\nGeographic information for revenues was as follows (in thousands):\nFor information regarding risks associated with our international operations, see \"Risk Factors,\" which appears in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information regarding long-lived assets, see Note 2, \"Segment Information\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSegment Financial Information\nFor information regarding segment revenues, profit or loss and assets, see Note 1, \"Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Accounting Policies, and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" and Note 2, \"Segment Information\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmployees\nAt December 31, 2014, we had 545 employees, 272 of which were located in the U.S., 184 of which were located in India, and 89 of which were located in Europe. None of these employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nExecutive Officers\nSee Part III, Item 10 \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about executive officers of the Registrant.\nAvailable Information\nOur corporate website is www.unitedonline.com. On this website, we make available, free of charge, our annual, quarterly and current reports (including all amendments to such reports), changes in the stock ownership of our directors and executive officers, our code of ethics, and other documents filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\nThe public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding the Company that we file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\nBy referring to our websites, including, without limitation, www.unitedonline.com, www.classmates.com, www.stayfriends.de, www.stayfriends.se, www.trombi.com, www.stayfriends.at, www.stayfriends.ch, and www.mypoints.com, we do not incorporate these websites or their contents into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY\nNew business initiatives, services, products, features, applications, or functionality may not be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have expended, and may continue to expend, significant resources in developing, integrating and implementing new business initiatives, services, products, features, applications, and functionality. Such development, integration and implementation involve a number of uncertainties, including unanticipated delays and expenses and technological problems. New business initiatives, services, products, features, applications, or functionality also may not be accepted by consumers or commercially successful. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in such development, integration and implementation efforts, or that any new business initiatives, services, products, features, applications, or functionality will be accepted by consumers or commercially successful. If our development, integration and implementation efforts are not successful, or such new business initiatives, services, products, features, applications, or functionality are not accepted by consumers or commercially successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.\nFailure to have a successful strategy that aligns with technology advances and trends could adversely affect our business.\nConsumers increasingly connect to the Internet through sources other than the personal computer, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, and their penetration will likely continue to increase. Our business will be adversely affected if we do not have a successful strategy that aligns with such trends. As new devices are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our services and products and developing competitive new services and products. Our social networking services and loyalty marketing service have a limited mobile presence, and we only began offering mobile broadband service and mobile voice service in March 2012 and November 2014, respectively. We may devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of services and products across multiple platforms. If we are slow to develop services, products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices, we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic, multi-screen environment. If we fail to implement a successful strategy that aligns with technology advances and trends, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrent or future economic conditions may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur services and products are dependent upon levels of consumer spending. Consumer spending patterns are difficult to predict and are sensitive to, among other factors, the general economic climate,\nconsumers' levels of disposable income, consumer debt, and overall consumer confidence. Challenging economic conditions have adversely impacted certain aspects of our businesses in a number of ways, including reduced demand, more aggressive pricing for similar services and products by our competitors, decreased spending by advertisers, increased credit risks, increased credit card failures, a loss of customers, and increased use of discounted pricing for certain of our services and products. Challenging economic conditions may adversely impact our key vendors and customers. Such economic conditions and decreased consumer spending have, in certain cases, resulted in, and may in the future result in, a variety of negative effects such as a reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin and operating margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, and recognition of impairments of assets, including goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to maintain or grow our advertising revenues. Reduced advertising revenues may reduce our profits.\nAdvertising revenues are a key component of revenues and profitability for our Communications and Content & Media segments. Factors that have caused, or may cause in the future, our advertising revenues to fluctuate include, without limitation, changes in the number of visitors to our websites, active accounts or consumers purchasing our services and products, the effect of, changes to, or terminations of key advertising relationships, changes to our websites and advertising inventory, changes in applicable laws, regulations or business practices, including those related to behavioral or targeted advertising, user privacy, and taxation, changes in business models, changes in the online advertising market, changes in the economy, advertisers' budgeting and buying patterns, competition, and changes in usage of our services. Decreases in our advertising revenues are likely to adversely impact our profitability.\nAdvertising revenues generated by our Communications and Content & Media segments have been fluctuating and may decline in the future as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties discussed above, in other risk factors, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any or all of the above factors have caused, and could continue to cause, our advertising revenues and profits to significantly decline in the future.\nOur business is subject to quarterly fluctuations.\nOur results of operations and changes in our key business metrics from period to period have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Each of the risk factors discussed in this Item 1A and the other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC may affect us from period to period and may affect our long-term performance. As a result, you should not rely on current results and period-to-period comparisons as an indication of our future performance. In addition, these factors and challenging economic conditions create difficulties with respect to our ability to forecast our financial performance and business metrics accurately. We believe that these difficulties in forecasting present even greater challenges for financial analysts who publish their own estimates of our future financial results and business metrics. We cannot assure you that we will achieve the expectations of, or projections made by, our management or the financial analysts. In the event we do not achieve such expectations or projections, our financial results and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nLegal actions or investigations could subject us to substantial liability, require us to change our business practices, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are currently, and have been in the past, party to various legal actions and investigations. These actions may include, without limitation, claims by private parties in connection with consumer protection and other laws, claims that we infringe third-party patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, securities laws claims, claims involving marketing practices or unfair competition, claims in connection with employment practices, breach of contract claims, and other business-related claims. The nature of our business could subject us to additional claims for similar matters, as well as a wide variety of other claims, including, without limitation, claims for defamation, right of publicity, negligence, and privacy and security matters. The failure to successfully defend against these and other types of claims, including claims relating to our business practices, could result in us incurring significant liabilities related to judgments or settlements or require us to change our business practices. Infringement claims may also result in our being required to obtain licenses from third parties, which licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Both the cost of defending claims, as well as the effect of settlements and judgments, could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from period to period and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we also file actions against third parties from time to time for various reasons, including, without limitation, to protect our intellectual property rights, to enforce our contractual rights, or to make other business-related claims. The legal fees, costs, and expenses associated with these actions may be significant, and if we were to lose these actions, we may be required to pay the other party's legal fees, costs and expenses, which also may be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nVarious governmental agencies have asserted claims, instituted legal actions, inquiries, or investigations, or imposed obligations relating to our business practices, such as our marketing, billing, customer retention, renewal, cancelation, refund, or disclosure practices, and they may continue to do so in the future. We have received civil investigative demands and subpoenas, as applicable, from the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and the Attorneys General of various states, primarily regarding their respective investigations into certain former post-transaction sales practices and certain of our marketing, billing, renewal, and privacy practices and disclosures. We have been cooperating with these investigations. However, the outcome of these or any other governmental investigations or their potential implications for our business are uncertain. We may not prevail in existing or future claims and any judgment against us or settlement or resolution of such claims may involve the payment of significant sums, including damages, fines, penalties, or assessments, or changes to our business practices. For example, in 2010, Classmates, Inc. (then known as Classmates Online, Inc.) paid $960,000 to resolve an investigation of the Attorney General for the State of New York related to its former post-transaction sales practices; and in July 2013, Classmates, Inc. (formerly known as Memory Lane, Inc.) paid $300,000 to resolve an investigation of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia related to its former post-transaction sales practices. Defending against lawsuits, inquiries, and investigations also involves significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. We cannot assure you that additional governmental investigations or other legal actions will not be instituted in connection with our former post-transaction sales practices or other current or former business practices. Enforcement actions or changes in enforcement policies and procedures could result in changes to our business practices, as well as significant damages, fines, penalties, or assessments, which could decrease our revenues or increase the costs of operating our business. To the extent that our services or business practices change as a result of claims or actions by governmental agencies or private parties (including in connection with settlement agreements related to such claims), or we are required to pay significant sums, including damages, fines, penalties, or assessments, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. For more information, see Note 12, \"Commitments and Contingencies-Legal\nMatters\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernmental regulation of the collection and use of personal information or our failure to comply with these regulations could harm our businesses.\nThe FTC has regulations regarding the collection and use of personal information obtained from individuals when accessing websites, with particular emphasis on access by minors. In addition, other governmental authorities have regulations to govern the collection and use of personal information that may be obtained from individuals when accessing websites. These regulations include requirements that procedures be established to disclose and notify users of our websites or mobile apps of our privacy and security policies, obtain consent from users for collection and use of personal information, and provide users with the ability to access, correct, or delete personal information that we store. In addition, the FTC and other governmental authorities have made inquiries and investigations of companies' practices with respect to their users' personal information collection and dissemination practices to confirm these are consistent with stated privacy policies and to determine whether precautions are taken to secure consumers' personal information. The FTC and certain state agencies also have made inquiries, and, in a number of situations, brought actions against companies to enforce the privacy policies of these companies, including policies relating to security of consumers' personal information.\nAs discussed in the preceding risk factor, we have been cooperating with the Attorneys General of various states in connection with their inquiries and investigations of, among other things, the privacy policies and former post-transaction sales practices of our Classmates.com business. Becoming subject to the regulatory and enforcement efforts of the FTC, a state agency, or other governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect demographic and personal information from users, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our marketing efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the adverse publicity regarding the existence or results of an investigation could have an adverse impact on our reputation and customers' willingness to use our websites and services and thus could adversely impact our business and future revenues.\nOur international businesses must also comply with applicable international data protection and privacy laws. If we or any of the third-party services on which we rely fail to transmit customer information and payment details in a secure manner, or if we or they otherwise fail to protect customer privacy in online transactions or if we or they transfer personal information without complying with certain required conditions or applicable laws, then we risk being exposed to civil and criminal liability, as well as claims from individuals alleging damages as a result of the alleged non-compliance. We may also be required to alter our data collection and use practices. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to online security risks and a security breach or inappropriate access to, or use of, our networks, computer systems or services or those of third-party vendors could expose us to liability, claims and a loss of revenue.\nThe success of our business depends on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party vendors (including vendors providing cloud computing and data storage services). In connection with conducting our business in the ordinary course, we store and transmit member information, including personally identifiable information. Unauthorized or inappropriate access to, or use of, our networks, computer systems or services (or the networks, computer systems or services of our third-party vendors), whether intentional, unintentional or as a result of criminal activity, could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including\ncredit card information, of our members and of third parties. A number of other websites have publicly disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose members or vendors. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our members, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or other devices or those of our members.\nA significant number of our members authorize us to bill their payment card accounts (credit or debit) directly for all amounts charged by us. These members provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. We rely on third-party and internally-developed encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including payment card information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Non-technical methods, for example, actions by an employee, can also result in a data breach. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our members and customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our businesses would be seriously harmed.\nWe may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach related to us or the parties with which we have commercial relationships, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss, litigation and liability. We cannot assure you that the security measures we take will be effective in preventing these types of activities. We also cannot assure you that the security measures of our third-party vendors, including network providers, providers of customer and billing support services, and other vendors, will be adequate. In addition, the coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. In addition to potential legal liability, these matters may adversely impact our reputation or our revenues and may interfere with our ability to provide our services and products, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur marketing efforts may not be successful or may become more expensive, either of which could increase our costs and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe spend significant resources marketing our brands, services, and products. We rely on relationships with a wide variety of third parties, including Internet search providers such as Google, social networking platforms such as Facebook, Internet advertising networks, co-registration partners, retailers, distributors, television advertising agencies, and direct marketers, to source new members and to promote or distribute our services and products. In addition, in connection with the launch of new services or products, we may spend a significant amount of resources on marketing. With any of our brands, services, and products, if our marketing activities are inefficient or unsuccessful, if important third-party relationships or marketing strategies, such as Internet search engine marketing and search engine optimization, become more expensive or unavailable, or are suspended, modified, or terminated, for any reason, if there is an increase in the proportion of consumers visiting our websites or purchasing our services and products by way of marketing channels with higher marketing costs as\ncompared to channels that have lower or no associated marketing costs, or if our marketing efforts do not result in our services and products being prominently ranked in Internet search listings, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur ability to operate our business could be seriously harmed if we lose members of our senior management team or other key employees or we are not able to attract, integrate and retain qualified new personnel.\nOur business is largely dependent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. Any of our officers or employees can terminate his or her employment relationship at any time. For example, Robert J. Taragan, the President of our Communications Segment, departed our company in February 2015. In addition, we do not carry key-person life insurance on any of our employees. The loss of any of our key officers or other employees, or our inability to attract, integrate and retain qualified employees, could require us to dedicate significant financial and other resources to such personnel matters, disrupt our operations and seriously harm our operations and business.\nSignificant problems with our key systems or those of our third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe systems underlying the operations of each of our business segments are complex and diverse, and must efficiently integrate with third-party systems, such as credit card processors. Key systems include, without limitation, billing, website and database management, customer support, telecommunications network management, advertisement serving and management systems, and internal financial systems. Some of these systems, such as customer support for our Internet access and loyalty marketing businesses are outsourced to third parties, and other systems are not redundant. In addition, some of our backup systems have never been operated as a primary system. We have experienced systems problems in the past. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Classmates website experienced outages that occurred intermittently over a one-week period, as well as stability issues. In addition, we or our third-party vendors may experience problems in the future. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. The continued and uninterrupted performance of our key systems is critical to our success. Unanticipated problems affecting these systems could cause interruptions in our services. In addition, if our third-party vendors face financial or other difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted. Any significant errors, damage, failures, interruptions, delays, or other problems with our systems, our backup systems or our third-party vendors or their systems could adversely impact our ability to satisfy our customers or operate our websites, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our Communications business outsources a significant portion of its live customer support functions. We rely on customer support vendors, and we maintain only a small number of internal customer support personnel for our businesses. Our internal customer support personnel are not equipped to provide the necessary range of customer support functions in the event that our vendors unexpectedly become unable or unwilling to provide these services to us. Any significant problems with our customer support vendors or our internal customer support personnel could adversely impact our ability to satisfy our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be unsuccessful at acquiring additional businesses, services or technologies. Even if we complete an acquisition, it may not improve our results of operations and may also adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nAcquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies may provide us with an opportunity to diversify the services and products we offer, leverage our assets and core competencies, complement our existing businesses, or expand our geographic reach.\nWe may evaluate a wide variety of potential strategic transactions that we believe may complement our existing businesses. However, we may not realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of an acquisition, and our attempts at integrating an acquired business may not be successful. Acquiring a business, service or technology involves many operational and financial risks, including risks relating to:\n\u2022 disruption of our ongoing business and significant diversion of resources and management time from day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u2022 acquisition financings that involve the issuance of potentially dilutive equity or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022 reduction of cash and other resources available for operations and other uses;\n\u2022 exposure to risks specific to the acquired business, service or technology to which we are not currently exposed;\n\u2022 risks of entering markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022 unforeseen obligations or liabilities, including future indemnification obligations;\n\u2022 difficulty assimilating the acquired customer bases, technologies and operations;\n\u2022 difficulty assimilating and retaining management and employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022 potential impairment of relationships with users, customers or vendors as a result of changes in management of the acquired business or other factors;\n\u2022 large write-offs either at the time of the acquisition or in the future, the incurrence of restructuring and other exit costs, the amortization of identifiable intangible assets, and the impairment of amounts capitalized as goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets; and\n\u2022 lack of, or inadequate, controls, policies and procedures appropriate for a public company, and the time, cost and difficulties related to the implementation of such controls, policies and procedures or the remediation of any deficiencies.\nIn addition, an acquisition of a foreign business involves risks in addition to those set forth above, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, potentially unfamiliar economic, political and regulatory environments, and integration difficulties due to language, cultural, and geographic differences. Any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in laws and regulations and new laws and regulations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to taxation, bulk email or \"spam,\" advertising, including, without limitation, targeted or behavioral advertising, user privacy and data protection, consumer protection, antitrust, export, and unclaimed property. Compliance with the various laws and regulations, which in many instances are unclear or unsettled, is complex. New laws and regulations, such as those being considered or recently enacted by certain states, the federal government, or international authorities related to automatic-renewal practices, spam, user privacy, targeted or behavioral advertising, and taxation, could impact our revenues or certain of our business practices or those of our advertisers. Any changes in the laws and regulations applicable to us, the enactment of any additional laws or regulations, or the failure to comply with, or increased enforcement activity by regulators of, such laws and regulations, could significantly impact our services and products, our costs, or the manner in which we or our advertisers conduct business, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and cause our business to suffer.\nOur social networking and loyalty marketing services rely heavily on email campaigns, and any disruptions or restrictions on the sending of emails or increase in the associated costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur emails have historically generated the majority of the traffic on our social networking websites and are a key driver of member activity for our loyalty marketing service. A significant number of members of our social networking and loyalty marketing services elect to opt-out of receiving certain types of emails. New laws, such as Canada's anti-spam legislation that went into effect in July 2014, may impact our ability to email some of our members, the types of emails we send to them or the content that we include in our emails to them. Without the ability to email these members, we have very limited means of inducing these members to return to our websites and utilize our services. In addition, each month, a significant number of email addresses for members of our social networking and loyalty marketing services become invalid. This disrupts our ability to email these members and also prevents our social networking members from being able to contact these members, which is one of the reasons why members use our services. An increase in the number of members to whom we are not able to send emails, or who elect to not receive, are unable to receive, or do not open, our emails could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. From time to time, Internet service providers block bulk email transmissions, classify as \"spam\" emails that have low opening rates, or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails to our members. Certain email service providers, such as Google's Gmail service, segregate marketing and promotional emails from other types of emails, which may impact the effectiveness of our email campaigns. Google's Gmail service also simplifies the opt-out process by including an \"unsubscribe\" link at the top of each marketing email, which allows the consumer to unsubscribe from future marketing emails from the particular marketer without first being redirected to the marketer's website. Third parties may also block, impose restrictions on, or start to charge for, the delivery of emails through their email systems. Due to the importance of email to our businesses, any disruption or restriction on the distribution of emails or increase in the associated costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our businesses, and such rights may be challenged, invalidated, infringed, misappropriated or be inadequate for the conduct of our businesses. The inability to protect such rights may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur trade names, trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, and other intellectual property are important to the success of our businesses. In particular, we view our primary trademarks as critical to our success. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and domain name laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, as well as licenses and other agreements with our employees, members, consumers, suppliers, and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary rights in the technology, services, products, and content used in our operations. These laws and agreements may not guarantee that our proprietary rights will be protected and our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged or invalidated. We have applied for the registration of, and have been issued, trademark registrations for trademarks and service marks used in our businesses in the U.S. and various foreign countries; however, there could be certain pre-existing and potentially conflicting trademark registrations held by third parties. The steps we have taken to obtain and to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequate, and other third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary rights. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. The protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights may require the expenditure of significant financial and internal resources. We cannot assure you that we\nhave taken adequate steps to prevent infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our brands and could harm our business. We are also subject to the risk of claims alleging that our business practices infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. These claims could result in lengthy and costly litigation. Moreover, resolution of any such claim against us may require us or one of our subsidiaries to obtain a license to use the intellectual property rights at issue or possibly to cease using those rights altogether. Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect comparisons of our operating results.\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and may be exposed to market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary currency exposures are the Euro and Indian Rupee, and to a much lesser extent, the Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. International revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollars as the U.S. Dollar weakens or strengthens against such other currencies. Substantially all of the revenues of our international businesses are received, and substantially all expenses are incurred, in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, which increases or decreases the related U.S. Dollar-reported revenues and expenses depending on the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our key business metrics, such as the Content & Media segment's average monthly revenue per pay account (which we also refer to as ARPU), are similarly affected by such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in global economic conditions, market factors, and governmental actions, among other factors, can affect the value of these currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar. A strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to these currencies and, in particular, to the Euro, has had, and in future periods could have, an adverse effect on the comparisons of our revenues and operating income against prior periods. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results, and such fluctuations could negatively impact the comparisons of such results against prior periods as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such instruments may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe may not realize the benefits associated with our assets and may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if we are required to expense certain costs or impair our assets.\nWe have capitalized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and certain business initiatives. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that goodwill or any such assets might be permanently impaired. If our acquisitions or business initiatives are not commercially successful or, if due to economic or other conditions, our assumptions regarding the performance of our businesses or business initiatives are not achieved, we would likely be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced impairment charges in the past, including a $55.4 million goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2013 with respect to our Classmates reporting unit. Given the current economic and competitive environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our businesses, we cannot assure you that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the challenging economic conditions, or the period or strength of recovery, made for purposes of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenues or growth rates of certain reporting units or other factors are not achieved or are revised downward, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods. If our operating segments\nchange in the future, such change may result in changes to our reporting units for impairment testing purposes, which may result in additional impairment charges. In addition, from time to time, we record tangible or intangible assets on our balance sheet that, due to changes in value or in our strategy, may have to be expensed in future periods. Write-downs or impairments of assets, whether tangible or intangible, could adversely and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign, state and local governments may attempt to impose additional income taxes, sales and use taxes, value added taxes or other taxes on our business activities and Internet-based transactions, including our past sales, which could decrease our ability to compete, reduce our sales, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to income and various other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our consolidated provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our effective income tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being less than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and more (or determined to be more by a particular taxing jurisdiction) than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by increases in the applicable tax rates, or by, among other factors, changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles, and interpretations. We are under audit and subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income and other taxes against us. For example, we are under an Internal Revenue Service audit which, if finally determined in an unfavorable manner, could result in a significant liability. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions, and our historical recognition of other tax matters. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn connection with our Internet-based transactions, a number of states, including California, have adopted or have been considering legislation or policy initiatives, including those that would facilitate a finding of nexus to exist between Internet companies and the states, aimed at expanding the reach of sales and use taxes or imposing state income or other taxes on various innovative theories, including agency attribution from independent third-party service providers. Such legislation or initiatives could result in the imposition of additional sales and use taxes, or the payment of state income or other taxes, on certain transactions conducted over the Internet. Our costs may increase as a result of our activities related to advertisers and other third parties, and advertisers and other third parties may choose to not do business with us or limit their business activities, in order to avoid nexus with certain states. If such legislation is enacted, or such initiatives are instituted, and unless overturned by the courts, the legislation or initiatives could subject us to substantially increased tax liabilities for past and future sales or state income or other taxes, require us to collect additional sales and use taxes, cause our future sales to decrease, or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and thus have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe face risks relating to operating and doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nOur businesses operate in a number of countries outside the U.S. Conducting international operations involves risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022 adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added taxes and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022 increased financial accounting, tax, and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022 lack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022 the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, regulations, and legal and regulatory standards;\n\u2022 political, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; and\n\u2022 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur stock price has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and it may continue to be volatile with extreme trading volume fluctuations. In January 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors has determined to discontinue cash dividend payments. Immediately following such announcement, the market price of our common stock declined significantly and has remained volatile. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly to the extent we are added to or removed from certain stock market indices. Stocks of other companies traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market have also experienced substantial price and trading volume fluctuations. The broad market and industry factors that influence or affect such fluctuations may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result of these or other reasons, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nOur businesses could be shut down or severely impacted by a catastrophic event.\nOur businesses could be materially and adversely affected by a catastrophic event. A disaster such as a fire, earthquake, flood, power loss, terrorism, or other similar event, affecting any of our facilities, data centers or computer systems, or those of our third-party vendors, or a system interruption or delay that slows down the Internet or makes the Internet or our websites temporarily unavailable, could result in a significant and extended disruption of our operations and services. Any prolonged disruption of our services due to these or other events would severely impact our businesses. The property, business interruption, and other insurance we carry may not be sufficient to cover, if at all, losses that may occur as a result of any events which cause interruptions in our services.\nWe cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing, which could adversely impact us.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our operations, for acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies, or for other purposes. Additional financing may not be available in a timely manner, on terms favorable to us, or at all. The current volatility of, and disruption in, the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds. If adequate funds are not available or not available when required and in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, our businesses and future prospects may suffer.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law limit the ability of our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could have the effect of delaying or discouraging takeover attempts that our stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial because of the premium price that would be offered by a potential acquirer. In addition, although our previous stockholder rights plan expired in 2011, we cannot assure you that our Board of Directors will not implement a new stockholder rights plan in the future.\nADDITIONAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT\nWe compete against much larger companies, many of whom have significantly more financial and marketing resources than we do, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous providers of broadband, mobile broadband, voice, and DSL services, as well as other dial-up Internet access providers, many of whom are much larger and have significantly more financial and marketing resources. Our principal competitors for our mobile broadband, voice and DSL services include, among others, local exchange carriers, wireless and satellite service providers, and cable service providers. These competitors include established providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Our principal dial-up Internet access competitors include established online service and content providers, such as AOL and MSN, and independent national Internet service providers, such as EarthLink and its PeoplePC subsidiary. Dial-up Internet access services do not compete favorably with broadband services with respect to connection speed and do not have a significant, if any, price advantage over certain broadband services. Many broadband providers, including cable companies and local exchange carriers, bundle their offerings with telephone, entertainment or other services, which may result in lower prices than standalone services. In addition, there are a number of mobile virtual network operators, some of which focus on pricing as their main selling point. Certain portions of the U.S., primarily rural areas, currently have limited or no access to broadband services. However, the U.S. government has indicated its intention to facilitate the provision of broadband services to such areas. Such expansion of the availability of broadband services will increase the competition for Internet access subscribers in such areas and will likely adversely affect our business. In addition to competition from broadband, mobile broadband, voice and DSL providers, competition among dial-up Internet access service providers is intense and neither our pricing nor our features provides us with a significant competitive advantage, if any, over certain of our dial-up Internet access competitors. We expect that competition, particularly with respect to price, for broadband, mobile broadband, and DSL services, as well as dial-up Internet access services, will continue and may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur declining dial-up and DSL pay accounts may adversely impact our Communications business.\nA significant portion of our Communications segment revenues and profits come from our dial-up Internet and DSL access services and related services and advertising revenues. Our dial-up and DSL Internet access pay accounts and revenues have been declining and are expected to continue to decline due to the continued maturation of the market for dial-up and DSL Internet access. Consumers continue to migrate to broadband access, primarily due to the faster connection and download speeds provided by broadband access. Advanced applications such as online gaming, music downloads, and videos require greater bandwidth for optimal performance, which adds to the demand for broadband access. The pricing for basic broadband services has been declining as well, making it a more viable option for consumers. In addition, the popularity of accessing the Internet through tablets and mobile devices has been growing and may accelerate the migration of consumers away from dial-up Internet access. The number of dial-up Internet access pay accounts has been adversely impacted by both a decrease in the number of new pay accounts signing up for our services, as well as the impact of\nsubscribers canceling their accounts, which we refer to as \"churn.\" Churn has increased from time to time and may increase in the future. We also experience an increase in the percentage of credit card failures from time to time. For example, a large-scale security breach at a retailer may result in the cancelation and re-issuance of the affected credit cards by the issuing banks, which would impact our ability to charge our members on their old credit cards and if our members do not update their credit card information with us, their accounts will terminate. Any change in the degree of credit card failures could have a material impact on our churn rate. If we experience a higher than expected level of churn, it will make it more difficult for us to increase or maintain the number of pay accounts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe expect our dial-up and DSL Internet access pay accounts to continue to decline, potentially at an increasing rate. Any growth in the number of mobile broadband or voice pay accounts may not be sufficient to offset such decline, at least in the near term. As a result, Communications services revenues and the profitability of this segment may decline. The rate of decline in Communications services revenues has accelerated in some periods and may continue to accelerate.\nAlthough we have reduced our expenses in order to manage the profitability of our Communications segment, we will not be able to continue making the same level of expense reductions in the future. Continued declines in Communications revenues, particularly if such declines accelerate, will materially and adversely impact the profitability of this segment.\nOur mobile broadband and voice services may not be commercially successful.\nWe started offering a mobile broadband service in March 2012 and a voice service in November 2014, both under the NetZero brand. However, there services may not be accepted by consumers or commercially successful. We have been testing various marketing initiatives, including offering discounts on our devices, but we cannot assure you that such initiatives will increase the number of accounts. The free version of the mobile broadband service is limited to a set term and these accounts are automatically terminated upon the expiration of such service term if they do not upgrade to one of the paid subscription plans. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in upgrading these accounts before they terminate. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name and brand recognition, larger user bases, wider coverage areas, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources than we do. If our mobile broadband and voice services fail to be commercially successful, such failure could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur Internet access business is dependent on the availability of telecommunications services and compatibility with third-party systems and products.\nOur Internet access business substantially depends on the availability, capacity, affordability, reliability, and security of our telecommunications networks. Only a limited number of telecommunications providers offer the network and data services we currently require, and we purchase most of our telecommunications services from a few providers. Some of our telecommunications services are provided pursuant to short-term agreements that the providers can terminate or elect not to renew. In addition, some telecommunications providers may cease to offer network services for certain less populated areas, which would reduce the number of providers from which we may purchase services and may entirely eliminate our ability to purchase services for certain areas. Currently, our mobile broadband and voice services are entirely dependent upon services acquired from one service provider, and the devices required by the provider can be used for only such provider's service. If we are unable to maintain, renew or obtain new agreement with the telecommunications provider on acceptable terms, or the provider discontinues its services, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Sprint, which owns Clearwire, has announced that it plans to cease using WiMAX technology\non the Clearwire network by November 2015. The implementation of this plan will affect our mobile broadband subscribers that utilize the Clearwire network. Our transition plan may not be successful or we may incur significant costs in implementing such plan. If our transition plan is not successful, or is not accepted by subscribers, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur dial-up Internet access services also rely on their compatibility with other third-party systems, products and features, including operating systems. Incompatibility with third-party systems and products could adversely affect our ability to deliver our services or a user's ability to access our services and could also adversely impact the distribution channels for our services. Our dial-up Internet access services are dependent on dial-up modems and an increasing number of computer manufacturers, including certain manufacturers with whom we have distribution relationships, do not pre-load their new computers with dial-up modems, requiring the user to separately acquire a modem to access our services. We cannot assure you that, as the dial-up Internet access market declines and new technologies emerge, we will be able to continue to effectively distribute and deliver our services.\nADDITIONAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR CONTENT & MEDIA SEGMENT\nWe face intense competition that could result in the failure of our social networking services and loyalty marketing service to be commercially successful.\nAs consumers continue to spend more time and money online, the competition for their time and engagement has continued to intensify. Consumers have a great number of options for online content and entertainment, including, by way of example, games, websites offering news and current events, movies, television shows, videos, information about any and virtually every topic, and the opportunity to communicate, socialize, and interact with acquaintances and others. Certain aspects of our social networking services compete with major social networking platforms, such as Facebook, as well as Internet search engines such as Google. Many of our competitors offer their content and services free of charge.\nThe market for loyalty marketing services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to significantly increase in the future as loyalty marketing programs continue to grow in popularity and expand to mobile platforms. Our MyPoints loyalty marketing service faces competition for members from other loyalty marketing programs, such as Ebates, as well as offline loyalty marketing programs that have a significant online presence, such as those operated by credit card, airline, and hotel companies. In addition, we also face competition for members from online providers of discounted offerings and coupons, such as Groupon and LivingSocial.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name and brand recognition, larger user bases, significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources, and engage in more extensive research and development than we do. Some of our competitors also have lower customer acquisition costs than we do, offer a wider variety of services, have more compelling websites with more extensive user-generated or third-party content, or offer their services or content free to their users. Some of our competitors have been more successful than we have been in attracting and retaining visitors and members, and our ability to attract visitors to our websites and maintain a large and growing member base has been adversely affected by such competition. In particular, Facebook's membership base currently far exceeds that of any of its competitors. If our competitors provide services similar to our social networking services for free, we may not be able to charge for our social networking services or we may need to reduce our membership fees. We rely on some of our competitors, such as Facebook, to promote our services and for new member acquisitions. Any changes to such competitors' rules or policies or any other changes implemented by such competitor could adversely affect our business or our strategies. Competition has adversely affected our subscription revenues from social networking services, as well as our advertising revenues from our social\nnetworking services and loyalty marketing service. More intense competition could also require us to increase our marketing or other expenditures. As a result of competition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected.\nContinued declines in the number of pay accounts for our social networking services could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows to suffer.\nPay accounts are critical to our business model. Only a small percentage of users visiting our websites or initially registering for our social networking services sign up for a paid subscription at the time of registration. As a result, our ability to generate subscription revenues is highly dependent on our ability to attract visitors to our websites, register them as free members, encourage them to return to our websites, and convince them to become pay accounts in order to access the pay features of our websites. In addition, changes to our registration or renewal processes, such as the changes required for our international social networking services to implement the Single Euro Payments Area (or SEPA) initiative, could adversely affect our churn rate.\nA number of our pay account subscriptions each month are not renewed or are canceled, which, for the Content & Media segment, we refer to as \"churn.\" The level of churn we experience fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including our mix of subscription terms, which affects the timing of subscription expirations, as well as the degree of credit card failures. To maintain or reduce the level of churn, we must continually add new pay accounts both to replace pay accounts who churn and to grow our business beyond our current pay account base. We expect that our churn rate will continue to fluctuate from period to period. A significant majority of our pay accounts are on plans that automatically renew at the end of their subscription period and we have received complaints with respect to our renewal policies and practices. As discussed in the risk factors related to changes in laws and regulations and to legal actions and investigations, the laws being considered and those that have been enacted by certain states regarding automatic-renewal practices will, and enforcement action or changes in enforcement policies and procedures could, impact certain of our business practices. We provide automatic-renewal notices to members in only those states that legally require such notices. If we provide such notices in additional states, or additional states start to require such notices, our churn rate may increase. We also experience an increase in the percentage of credit card failures from time to time. For example, a large-scale security breach at a retailer may result in the cancelation and re-issuance of the affected credit cards by the issuing banks, which would impact our ability to charge our members on their old credit cards and if our members do not update their credit card information with us, their accounts will terminate. Any change in our renewal policies or practices, or in the degree of credit card failures, could have a material impact on our churn rate. If we experience a higher than expected level of churn, it will make it more difficult for us to increase or maintain the number of pay accounts, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur pay accounts and free active accounts have been decreasing, and we anticipate that Content & Media pay accounts and revenues will continue to decline year over year, at least in the near term. If we are not able to attract visitors to our websites and convert a significant portion to pay accounts, the number of pay accounts for our social networking services and related advertising revenues will continue to decline and the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of our Content & Media segment will be adversely affected.\nFailure to increase or maintain the number of visitors to our websites and members for our social networking and loyalty marketing services or the activity level of these visitors and members could cause our business and financial results to suffer.\nThe success of our social networking and loyalty marketing services depends upon our ability to increase or maintain the number of visitors to our websites, our base of free members, and the level of\nactivity of those visitors and members. A decline in the number of visitors or registered or active free social networking members, or a decline in the activity of those members, could result in decreased pay accounts, decreased content on our websites, and decreased advertising revenues. A decline in the number of registered or active loyalty marketing service members could also result in decreased advertising revenues. We have experienced a decline in our number of active members. The failure to increase or maintain the number of visitors to our websites, our base of free members, or the failure to convince our free members to actively participate in our websites or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFailure to maintain our standard pricing could have adverse effects on our financial results.\nFor competitive and other reasons, we have been offering a large percentage of discounted pricing plans on a promotional basis. In general, these discounted pricing plans offer a subscription term at a significant discount compared to the standard pricing for such subscription term. Any increases in the percentage of pay accounts under a discounted pricing plan and any increases in the level of the discounts will likely result in a decrease in subscription revenues and ARPU, in particular, if such increases continue. Although these discounted pricing plans, by their terms, renew at the then-current standard pricing for such subscription term upon the expiration of the initial term, we cannot determine the number of pay accounts that will renew at the then-current standard pricing or at all. We intend to continue offering discounted pricing plans in the future, and we cannot assure you that the volume or level of the discounts offered during a period will not be higher than anticipated. Our continued use of discounted pricing plans has resulted in our becoming dependent on offering such plans in order to obtain new pay accounts and retain existing pay accounts and may result in our having to reduce our standard pricing, which would adversely impact our financial results.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE FTD SPIN-OFF TRANSACTION\nIf the FTD Spin-Off Transaction were to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the FTD Spin-Off Transaction could result in significant tax liabilities.\nUnited Online, Inc. received a private letter ruling from the IRS, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the FTD Spin-Off Transaction qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, prior to the consummation of the FTD Spin-Off Transaction, United Online, Inc. received a legal opinion, substantially to the effect that the FTD Spin-Off Transaction so qualifies. The IRS ruling and the tax opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions and undertakings, and certain representations from United Online, Inc. and FTD, regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters, and the tax opinion relies on the IRS ruling. Notwithstanding the IRS ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine that the FTD Spin-Off Transaction should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings is not correct, or that the FTD Spin-Off Transaction should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinion that are not covered by the IRS ruling.\nIf the FTD Spin-Off Transaction ultimately is determined to be taxable, then a stockholder of United Online, Inc. that received shares of FTD common stock in the FTD Spin-Off Transaction would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of United Online's current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any amount that exceeded United Online's earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of United Online, Inc. stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. In addition, United Online would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the\nfair market value of the shares of common stock of FTD held by United Online, Inc. on the distribution date over United Online, Inc.'s tax basis in such shares.\nIn connection with the FTD Spin-Off Transaction, FTD indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified FTD for certain liabilities. This indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by FTD and FTD may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with FTD, FTD agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify FTD for certain liabilities, in certain cases, for unlimited amounts. We cannot assure you that the indemnity from FTD will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that FTD will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Third-parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that FTD has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from FTD any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, certain indemnities that we may be required to provide to FTD are not subject to any limits on the aggregate amount of the liability, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 87261, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "UNTD"}
