{"cik": "1327471", "company": "RealD Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. If any of these events or the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks relating to our business and our industry\nIf motion pictures that can be viewed with RealD Cinema Systems are not made or are not commercially successful, our revenue will decline.\nAlmost all of our revenue is currently dependent upon both the number of 3D motion pictures released and the commercial success of those 3D motion pictures. Although we have produced alternative content in 3D, such as the production of Carmen in 3D with London's Royal Opera House, we are not actively developing 3D motion pictures or our own 3D content, and therefore, we rely on motion picture studios to produce and release 3D motion pictures compatible with our RealD Cinema Systems. There is no guarantee that the number of 3D motion pictures being released will remain at current levels or increase, or that motion picture studios will continue to produce 3D motion pictures at all. Motion picture studios may refrain from producing and releasing 3D motion pictures for any number of reasons, including their lack of commercial success, changes in consumer preferences, the lower-cost to produce 2D motion pictures or the availability of other entertainment options. The commercial success of a 3D motion picture depends on a number of factors that are outside of our control, including whether it achieves critical acclaim, timing of the release, cost, marketing efforts and promotional support for the release. In the past, consumer interest in 3D motion pictures was episodic and motion picture studios tended to use 3D motion pictures as a gimmick rather than as an artistic tool to enhance the viewing experience. Consumer preferences have recently trended toward viewing motion pictures in 2D rather than 3D resulting in weaker box office performance. Weaker box office performance of 3D motion pictures may result in motion picture studios producing fewer 3D motion pictures or motion picture exhibitors may reduce the frequency in which they show motion pictures in 3D or may decide not to show 3D motion pictures at peak movie-going hours. Poor box office performance of 3D motion pictures, disruption or reduction in 3D motion picture production or conversion of 2D motion pictures into 3D motion pictures, changes in release schedules, the inability to see 3D motion pictures at peak hours, cancellations of motion picture releases in 3D versions, a reduction in marketing efforts for 3D motion pictures by motion picture studios or a lack of consumer demand for 3D motion pictures could result in lower 3D motion picture attendance, which would substantially reduce our revenue, which declined in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Moreover, films can be subject to delays in production or changes in release schedule, and the slippage of a film's release date from one accounting period to another could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nIf motion picture exhibitors do not continue to use our RealD Cinema Systems, negotiate renewals of their licensing agreements for substantially lesser fees or renew with substantial concessions, or if they experience financial difficulties, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur primary licensees in the motion picture industry are motion picture exhibitors. Our license agreements with motion picture exhibitors do not obligate these licensees to deploy a specific number of our RealD Cinema Systems. We cannot predict whether any of our existing motion picture exhibitor licensees will continue to perform under their license agreements with us, whether we or any of our existing motion picture exhibitor licensees may now or in the future be in breach of those agreements or whether our existing motion picture exhibitor licensees will renew their license agreements with us at the end of their term. If our existing motion picture exhibitor licensees do not renew their license agreements with us, negotiate renewals of their license agreements for substantially lesser license fees or with substantial concessions, or seek to take advantage of incentive offers related to securing renewals of existing contracts, our revenue would decline, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if motion picture exhibitors reduce or eliminate the number of 3D motion pictures that are exhibited in theaters, then our revenue could be materially and adversely affected, and motion picture studios may not produce and release 3D motion pictures, which could also adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nIn addition, license revenue from Wanda (including AMC), Cinemark and Regal collectively comprised approximately 31% of our gross license revenue in the year ended March 31, 2015, 33% in the year ended March 31, 2014 and 22% in the year ended March 31, 2013. If any of these motion picture exhibitors were to experience financial difficulties, they may be unable to pay us amounts due in a timely fashion or at all, which could substantially reduce our cash flow and materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in order to attract more movie-goers, these motion picture exhibitors recently renovated certain of their theaters and installed larger chairs, which not only led to reduced seating capacity, but also resulted in higher ticket prices. If the motion picture exhibitors are unable to attract more movie-goers who are willing to pay higher ticket prices, they could experience financial difficulties, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nA deterioration in our relationships with the major motion picture studios could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe six major motion picture studios accounted for approximately 78% of domestic box office revenue and eight of the top 10 grossing 3D motion pictures in calendar year 2014. Such 3D motion pictures are also released internationally. In addition, for our domestic operations, these major motion picture studios pay us a per use fee for our RealD eyewear. To the extent that our relationship with any of these major motion picture studios deteriorates or any of these studios stop making motion pictures that can be viewed at RealD-enabled theater screens, refuse to co-brand with us, stop using or paying for the use of or reduce the amounts paid for our RealD eyewear in domestic and certain international markets, our costs could increase and our revenue could decline, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if consumers' demand for 3D motion pictures declines, then motion picture studios may reduce marketing the 3D aspect of 3D motion pictures which could reduce box office performance of 3D motion pictures and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nIf the deployment of our RealD Cinema Systems is delayed or not realized, our future prospects could be limited and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have license agreements with motion picture exhibitors that give us the right, subject to certain exceptions, to deploy our RealD Cinema Systems if a location under contract is already equipped with our systems. Under the terms of these agreements, the motion picture exhibitor licensees may choose to install additional 3D digital projector systems. However, our license agreements do not obligate our licensees to deploy a specific number of our RealD Cinema Systems. Numerous factors beyond our control could influence when and whether our RealD Cinema Systems will be deployed, including motion picture exhibitors' ability to fund capital expenditures, or their decision to delay or abandon the conversion of their theaters to digital projection or reduce the number of 3D motion pictures exhibited in their theaters, and our ability to secure adequate supplies of components comprising our RealD Cinema System in any given period. If motion picture exhibitors delay, postpone or decide not to deploy RealD Cinema Systems at the number of screens they have announced, or we are unable to deploy our RealD Cinema Systems in a timely manner, our future prospects could be limited and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses and may suffer losses in the future.\nWhile we were profitable in the fiscal year ended March 23, 2012, we incurred net losses in our fiscal years ended 2015, 2014, 2013, 2011, and 2010. Our revenues declined in our fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior year. If we cannot return to sustainable revenue growth and profitability, our financial condition will deteriorate, and we may be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nWe may not achieve anticipated cost savings from the implementation of our cost reduction plans and may experience difficulties, delays and unexpected costs in continuing our cost reduction efforts.\nWe implemented our cost reduction plans to reduce the overall costs of our global operations, and we are seeking further efficiencies in our cost structure, including actively evaluating alternatives for certain of our research and development efforts. Moreover, we announced in December 2014 additional operating expense savings and capital expenditure reductions projected for fiscal year 2016. We may encounter difficulties, delays and unexpected costs in connection with such efforts. Our ability to achieve anticipated savings is dependent upon various business developments, such as the state of development of, and prospects for, our new technologies, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to achieve the anticipated savings or benefits to our business in the expected time frame or other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, part of our cost reduction efforts may involve an involuntary reduction in force. For our cost reduction efforts to be successful while at the same time building a framework for future growth, we must continue to execute and deliver on our core business initiatives around the world with fewer human resources and intellectual capital. This will include managing complexities associated with a geographically diverse organization. We must also attract, retain and motivate key employees, including highly qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel who are critical to our business. We may not be able to attract, retain or motivate qualified employees in the future and our inability to do so may adversely affect our business.\nWe have not yet finalized our cost reduction plan for fiscal year 2016 and there is no guarantee that any net cost reduction will actually be achieved. There may also be other risks associated with our cost reduction efforts and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. If we fail to execute on our initiatives, such failure could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the strategic alternative process will result in pursuing or completing a particular transaction.\nIn the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we announced that we had engaged Moelis & Company LLC as our financial advisor to assist in our evaluation of potential strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives will result in either pursuing or completing a particular transaction. We also may not accurately assess the risks and uncertainties associated with engaging in a strategic alternative, and the anticipated benefits from pursuing any such alternative may not materialize. In addition, undertaking a strategic process could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business, potentially have adverse effects on our existing business relationships and our key employees.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nIn connection with the preparation of our interim financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, our management team and independent registered public accounting firm identified certain deficiencies in our internal controls that, when aggregated, were determined to be a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We have initiated a remediation plan to enhance our control procedures for the identified deficiencies, but will not consider the material weakness remediated until our controls are operational for a sufficient period of time, tested and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. Prior to such time, there remains risk that the transitional controls on which we currently rely will fail to be sufficiently effective, which could result in a material misstatement of our financial position or results of operations and require a restatement of our financial statements.\nIf we are unable to establish appropriate internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, we may be subject to litigation and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations or comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Further and continued determinations that there are significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal controls could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures to comply with applicable requirements.\nAny inability to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our 3D and other visual technologies and our brands, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nOur business is dependent upon our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property rights protection, however, may not be available or timely under the laws of every country in which we and our licensees operate, such as China. For example, we believe competitors may be introducing cinema systems similar to our RealD Cinema Systems that potentially infringe on our intellectual property rights in China, Russia and other territories to unfairly compete against us. While we are actively engaged in the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights, the efforts we have taken may not be sufficient or we may not prevail. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. It may not be practicable or cost effective for us to fully protect our intellectual property rights in some countries or jurisdictions. If we are unable to successfully identify and stop unauthorized use of our intellectual property, we could lose potential revenue and experience increased operational and enforcement costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nIt is possible that some of our 3D and other visual technologies may not be protectable by patents. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect particular innovations that later turn out to be important. Even where we do have patent protection, the scope of such protection may be insufficient to prevent third parties from designing around our particular patent claims or otherwise avoiding infringement. Furthermore, there is always the possibility that an issued patent may later be found to be invalid or unenforceable, or a competitor may attempt to engineer around our issued patent. Additionally, patents only offer a limited term of protection. Moreover, the intellectual property we maintain as trade secrets could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets.\nAny failure to maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees, licensees and suppliers, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation.\nIn connection with the sales and marketing of our products and our entering into licensing arrangements with motion picture exhibitors, we may from time to time transmit confidential information. We also have access to, collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, licensees and suppliers, as well as our business. We have procedures in place to safeguard such data and information and as a result of those procedures, to our knowledge, computer hackers have been unable to gain access to the information stored in our information systems. However, cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is possible that computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures or those that we do business with in the future and obtain the personal information of our customers, employees, licensees and suppliers or our business information. A security breach of any kind could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights disputes that are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use particular 3D and other visual technologies in the future.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation or any other disputes by other parties alleging that our 3D and other visual technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property disputes, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination in any intellectual property dispute could require us to pay damages and/or stop using our 3D and other visual technologies, trademarks, copyrighted works and other material found to be in violation of another party's rights and could prevent us from licensing our 3D and other visual technologies to others. In order to avoid these restrictions and resolve the dispute, we may have to pay for a license. This license may not be available on reasonable terms, could require us to pay significant license fees and may significantly increase our operating expenses. A license also may not be available to us at all. As a result, we may be required to use and/or develop non-infringing alternatives, which could require significant effort and expense, or which may not be possible. If we cannot obtain a license or develop alternatives for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our 3D and other visual technologies and may be unable to compete effectively. In certain instances, we have contractually agreed to provide indemnification to licensees relating to our intellectual property. This may require us to defend or hold harmless motion picture exhibitors, manufacturers or other licensees. We have from time to time corresponded with one or more third parties regarding patent enforcement issues and in-bound and out-bound patent licensing opportunities. In addition, from time to time we may be engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our intellectual property rights, including matters related to our license fee rates and other terms of our licensing arrangements. These types of disputes can be asserted by our licensees or prospective licensees or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief or in regulatory actions. Requests for monetary and injunctive remedies asserted in claims like these could be material and could have a significant impact on our business. Any disputes with our licensees, potential licensees or other third parties could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur reliance on certain significant suppliers for the raw materials used in our RealD Cinema Systems subjects us to risks which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on certain significant suppliers for the raw materials used in our RealD Cinema Systems, which are critical to our operations. Our business could be negatively impacted by any quality or reliability issues with our suppliers\u2019 products, including any undetected, latent defects. In addition, our dependence on these suppliers subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations. If any of our suppliers are unable to fulfill their obligations to us, or if we are unable to find replacement suppliers in the event of a supply shortage or disruption, we could incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies and risk using lesser quality products, either of which could materially harm our business. Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of raw materials caused by the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the supply used in our RealD Cinema Systems. Any inability on our part to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of raw materials that are critical to our operations.\nOur RealD Cinema Systems and other visual technologies are generally designed for use with third-party technologies and hardware, and if we are unable to maintain the ability of our RealD Cinema Systems and other visual technologies to work with these third-party technologies and hardware, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur RealD Cinema Systems and other visual technologies are generally designed for use with third-party technologies and hardware, such as Christie and Barco projectors, Doremi servers, Harkness Hall screens and Sony Electronics 4K SXRD\u00ae digital cinema projectors. Third-party technologies and hardware may be modified, re-engineered or removed altogether from the marketplace. In addition, third-party technologies used to interact with our 3D and other visual technologies can change without prior notice to us, which could result in increased costs or our inability to provide our 3D and other visual technologies to our licensees. If we are unable to maintain the ability of our 3D and other visual technologies to work with these third-party technologies and hardware, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand and reputation for providing high quality 3D and other visual technologies, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur business, results of operations and prospects depend, in part, on maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation for providing high quality 3D and other visual technologies. If problems with our 3D and other visual technologies cause motion picture exhibitors or other licensees to experience operational disruption or failure or delays in the delivery of their products and services to their customers, our brand and reputation could be diminished. Maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation may be particularly challenging if we enter business segments in which we have limited experience. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nCompetition from other providers of 3D technologies to the motion picture industry could adversely affect our business.\nThe motion picture industry is highly competitive, particularly among providers of 3D technologies. Our primary competitors include Dolby, Sony, IMAX, MasterImage and Xpand. In addition, other companies, including motion picture exhibitors and studios and smaller competitors in international markets, may develop their own 3D technologies in the future. Consumers may also perceive the quality of 3D technologies delivered by some of our competitors to be equivalent or superior to our 3D technologies. In addition, some of our current or future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater market share and name recognition, ability to develop and be the first to introduce new 3D technologies successfully to the market or more experience or advantages in the business segments in which we compete that will allow them to offer lower prices or higher quality technologies, products or services. If we do not successfully compete with these providers of 3D technologies, we could continue to lose market share and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, competition could force us to decrease prices and cause our margins to decline, which could adversely affect our business. Pricing pressures in both domestic and international motion picture exhibitor markets continue, and no assurance can be given that our margins in future periods will increase.\nThe introduction of new 3D and other visual technologies and changes in the way that our competitors operate could harm our business. If we fail to keep up with rapidly changing 3D and other visual technologies or the growth of new and existing opportunities, our 3D and other visual technologies could become less competitive or obsolete.\nDue to technological advances and changing consumer tastes, numerous companies have developed, and are expected to continue to develop, new 3D and other visual technologies that may compete directly with or render our 3D and other visual technologies less competitive or obsolete. We believe that original equipment manufacturers may be working to develop laser-based projection technologies, which may compete with, be incompatible with or render our RealD Cinema Systems obsolete. Competitors may develop alternative 3D and other visual technologies that are more attractive to consumers, content producers and distributors, motion picture exhibitors and others, or more cost effective than our technologies, and compete with or render our 3D and other visual technologies less competitive or obsolete. As a result of this competition, we could continue to lose market share, which could harm our business and operating results. If we are unable to develop and effectively market new 3D and other visual technologies that adequately or competitively address the needs of these changing industries, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we face competition from companies that enjoy competitive advantages in the industries in which we operate for our research and development projects. Our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, more developed and distribution channels and relationships with manufacturers, and technologies that may be better suited to bring these products to market. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, products, technologies or standards in 3D and other visual technologies and may offer consumers superior technology or lower prices which may reduce the demand for visual display devices using our 3D and other visual technologies. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the industries in which we operate for our research and development projects.\nIf our 3D and other visual technologies fail to be widely adopted by or are not compatible with the needs of our licensees, our business prospects could be limited and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur licensees depend upon our 3D and other visual technologies being compatible with a wide variety of motion picture and other systems, products and infrastructure. We make significant efforts to design our 3D and other visual technologies to address capability, quality and cost considerations so that they either meet or, where possible, exceed the needs of our licensees. To have our 3D and other visual technologies widely adopted, we must convince a broad spectrum of professional organizations worldwide, as well as motion picture studios and exhibitors and other industry participants, to adopt them, and to ensure that our 3D and other visual technologies are compatible with their systems, products and infrastructure.\nIf our 3D and other visual technologies are not widely adopted or retained or if we fail to conform our 3D and other visual technologies to the expectations of, or standards set by, industry participants, they may not be compatible with other products and our business, operating results and prospects could be adversely affected. We expect that meeting and maintaining the needs of our licensees for compatibility with them will be significant to our business in the future. In addition, the market for broadcast technologies has traditionally been heavily regulated by governments or other regulatory bodies, and we expect this to continue to be the case in the future. If our 3D and other visual technologies are not compatible with the broadcasting infrastructure or governmental or regulatory requirements in particular geographic areas, our ability to compete in these markets could be adversely affected.\nOther forms of entertainment may be more attractive to consumers than those using our 3D and other visual technologies, which could harm our growth and operating results.\nWe face competition for consumer attention from other forms of entertainment that may drive down motion picture box office and license revenue from motion picture exhibitors. We compete with a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels, such as cable, satellite, broadcast, packaged media and the Internet and business models in these areas continue to evolve rapidly. There are also other forms of entertainment competing for consumers' leisure time and disposable income such as concerts, amusement parks, sporting events and, from time to time, other major events like the Olympic Games or the World Cup. A significant increase in the popularity of these motion picture channels and competing forms of entertainment could reduce the demand for theatrical exhibition of 3D motion pictures, including those viewed with our RealD Cinema Systems, or the use of 3D-enabled consumer electronics devices, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe have a limited operating history in several of the industries in which we are conducting our research and development projects, which makes it difficult to predict our future prospects and financial performance.\nWe have a limited operating history in several of the industries in which we are conducting our research and development projects. As such, the potential for future success for our research and development projects will depend on the challenges, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties encountered by us and we cannot predict whether and when any of such projects will be commercially available in the near future or at all. In addition, our research and development projects must be considered in light of our strategic plan to focus on our core business: the innovation and licensing of 3D and other visual technologies for the theater. In connection with this strategic plan, we are actively evaluating alternatives for refocusing and restructuring our research and development efforts through partnering or other means by which we can commercialize these technologies while keeping low or further reducing our cost structure. However, we cannot assure you that any strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will be beneficial to our business or provide greater value to our stockholders.\nOur level of indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate.\nAs of March 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was approximately $29.8 million. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following: (i) we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service and repay our debt and related obligations and have sufficient funds left over to achieve or sustain profitability in our operations; (ii) we may be unable to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs in order to compete successfully in our industry, particularly if we increase our debt obligations under our secured credit facility; (iii) we may be limited in our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, including obtaining additional commitments from our revolving credit facility; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to lesser leveraged competitors; (v) we may be limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and (vi) we may be vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates.\nWe may borrow additional amounts under our credit facilities to fund various growth initiatives, including accelerated research and product development, acquisitions, capital expenditures and stock repurchases. As of March 31, 2015, $50 million was available under our revolving credit facility, which matures on June 26, 2017, and $12.7 million was available under our term loan facility, which matures on June 26, 2018.\nOur credit facilities require us to pay a variable rate of interest, which will increase or decrease based on variations in certain financial indexes, and fluctuations in interest rates can significantly decrease our profits. We do not have any hedge or similar contracts in place that would protect us against changes in interest rates. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, or if refinancing is available, that it can be obtained on terms we can afford. For more information regarding our credit facilities, see \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Liquidity and capital resources\".\nOur credit facilities impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, significant operating, financial and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries.\nRestrictions imposed by our credit facilities will limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into certain merger and consolidation transactions; and\n\u2022\nsell our assets other than in the ordinary course of business.\nWe are also required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If we fail to comply with any of the covenants or if any other event of default, as defined in our credit facilities, should occur, the lenders could elect to prevent us from borrowing and declare the indebtedness to be immediately due and payable.\nThese restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these restrictions, including breach of financial covenants, could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness, which will constitute substantially all of our assets.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which may be different from analysts' expectations and adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Factors that have affected our operating results in the past, and are likely to affect our operating results in the future, include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe timing of when a 3D motion picture is released which tends to be based on specific consumer entertainment dynamics, which results in seasonal patterns, with the largest number of motion pictures being released in summer and early winter;\n\u2022\nthe attendance at 3D versions of motion picture releases;\n\u2022\nthe rate of installations of new RealD Cinema Systems, which we expect to decrease with the passage of time;\n\u2022\nthe timing of capital expenditures and expenses, including depreciation expense of our RealD Cinema Systems deployed at a motion picture exhibitor's premises (we expect capital expenditures to decrease, and depreciation expense to increase, as our RealD Cinema Systems business matures), digital projector depreciation expenses, RealD eyewear costs (including shipping, handling and recycling costs), field service and support costs, and occupancy costs, which may increase significantly, even in quarters when we do not experience a similar growth in revenue;\n\u2022\nthe timing and accuracy of license fee reports which often include positive or negative corrective or retroactive license fees that cover extended periods of time;\n\u2022\nrates of growth in installation of our RealD Cinema Systems overseas, especially in China, Russia and other emerging economies;\n\u2022\nmanagement of our expenses as we continue to focus on our core strategy, conduct a strategic process and implement our cost reduction plans; and\n\u2022\ncompetitive and pricing pressures that vary from market-to-market and place-to-place.\nIn addition, variances in our operating results from analysts' expectations could adversely affect our stock price. See also \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Seasonality and quarterly performance\".\nWe face a number of challenges with respect to the maturity of the domestic digital cinema market, and if motion picture exhibitors do not continue converting analog theaters to digital outside of the United States or the pace of conversion slows, our future prospects could be limited and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur RealD Cinema Systems only work in theaters equipped with digital cinema projection systems, which enable 3D motion pictures to be delivered, stored and projected electronically, and our systems are not compatible with analog motion picture projectors. Motion picture exhibitors have been converting projectors from analog to digital cinema over the last several years, giving us the opportunity to deploy our RealD Cinema Systems. After motion picture exhibitors convert their projectors to digital cinema, they must install a polarization preserving screen and our RealD Cinema System to display motion pictures in RealD 3D. The conversion by motion picture exhibitors of their projectors and screens from analog to digital cinema requires significant expense. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 93% of domestic theater screens had converted to digital and approximately 78% of the international theater screens had been converted. We face a number of challenges with respect to the maturity of the domestic digital cinema market, including that the demand for new digital cinema screens has decreased significantly. Future growth in the domestic digital cinema market will depend on a number of factors, including the construction of new theaters, exhibitors choosing to deploy our RealD Cinema Systems versus competing or alternative technologies and our ability to maintain competitive pricing. In addition, if the market for digital cinema overseas develops more slowly than expected, or if the motion picture exhibitors we have agreements with delay or abandon the conversion of their theaters from analog theaters to digital, our ability to grow our revenue and our business could be adversely affected. While DCIP and Cinedigm financing provided funding for the digital conversion of domestic theater screens operated by many of our licensees, there has not yet been a similar effort to organize digital conversion in certain geographies outside North America. If the pace of digital conversion outside of the United States does not follow that which occurred inside the United States, our revenue may not grow or may decline, and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur asset impairment charges.\nAn asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our long-lived assets. We review our long-lived assets for impairment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of system upgrades and replacements, reductions in demand for specific technologies, a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions, events related to particular customers or asset type, or as a result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.\nAdditionally, in connection with our cost reduction plans, we intend to relocate our headquarters in Los Angeles, California, and therefore expect to incur material impairments on leasehold improvements in the future.\nWe face risks from doing business internationally that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on international business for a significant portion of our total revenue. International gross revenue accounted for approximately 57% in fiscal 2015, 52% in fiscal 2014 and 50% in fiscal 2013. We expect that our international business will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. This future revenue will depend to a large extent on the continued use and expansion of our 3D and other visual technologies in the motion picture industry outside of North America. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business operations, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\ncompetitive and pricing pressures that vary from market-to-market and place-to-place;\n\u2022\nfluctuating foreign exchange rates and systems;laws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to customs, duties, the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes and changes in these laws and our compliance with the foregoing;\n\u2022\nchanges in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content;\n\u2022\ndiffering cultural tastes and attitudes;\n\u2022\ndiffering degrees of protection for intellectual property;\n\u2022\nthe need to adapt our business model to local requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\nimposition of differing labor laws and standards;\n\u2022\nthe instability of foreign economies and governments; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disaster, war or acts of terrorism.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with our international business operations could adversely affect our revenue from such operations, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur RealD eyewear may, in the future, be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by other state or foreign governmental or regulatory agencies, which could increase our costs and materially and adversely impact our profitability.\nCurrently, polarized 3D eyewear, including our RealD eyewear, is not regulated by the FDA, or by state or foreign governmental and regulatory agencies. However, certain eyewear, such as non-prescription reading glasses and sunglasses, are considered to be medical devices by the FDA and are subject to regulations imposed by the FDA and various state and foreign governmental and regulatory agencies. With the rising popularity of polarized 3D eyewear, there has been an increasing level of public scrutiny examining its potential health risks. Polarized 3D eyewear, including our RealD eyewear, may at some point be subject to federal, state or foreign regulations that could potentially restrict how our RealD eyewear is produced, used or marketed, and the cost of complying with those regulations may adversely affect our profitability.\nIf 3D viewing with active or passive eyewear is found to cause health risks or consumers believe that it does, demand for the 3D viewing experience may decrease or we may become subject to liability, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nResearch conducted by institutions unrelated to us has suggested that 3D viewing with active or passive eyewear may cause vision fatigue, eye strain, discomfort, headaches, motion sickness, dizziness, nausea, epileptic seizures, strokes, disorientation, perceptual after-effects, decreased postural stability or other health risks in some consumers. If these potential health risks are substantiated or consumers believe in their validity, demand for the 3D viewing experience in the theater, the home and elsewhere may decline. As a result, major motion picture studios and other content producers and distributors may refrain from developing 3D content, motion picture exhibitors may reduce the number of 3D-enabled screens (including RealD-enabled screens) they currently deploy or plan to deploy, or they may reduce the number of 3D motion pictures exhibited in their theaters, which would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. A decline in consumer demand may also lead to the reduction or abandonment of 3D products, which could adversely affect our prospects and financial condition.\nIn addition, if health risks associated with our RealD eyewear materialize, we may become subject to governmental regulation or product liability claims, including claims for personal injury. Successful assertion against us of one or a series of large claims could materially harm our business. Also, if our RealD eyewear is found to be defective, we may be required to recall it, which may result in substantial expense and adverse publicity that could adversely impact our sales, operating results and reputation. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, we may also be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business. Even meritless product liability claims could be expensive to resolve and may divert our management's attention.\nOur agreements with motion picture studios domestically and motion picture exhibitors internationally require us to manage the supply chain of our RealD eyewear, and any interruption to the supply chain for our RealD eyewear components could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nOur RealD eyewear is an integral part of our RealD Cinema Systems. We have entered into non-exclusive agreements with several manufacturers to produce RealD eyewear. We manage manufacturing, distribution and recycling of RealD eyewear for motion picture studios and exhibitors worldwide. Domestically, we generally provide our RealD eyewear free of charge to motion picture exhibitors and then receive a fee from the motion picture studios for the usage of that RealD eyewear by the motion picture exhibitors' customers. Most international motion picture exhibitors and some domestic motion picture exhibitors purchase RealD eyewear directly from us and sell them to consumers as part of their admission or as a concession item. Any\ninterruption in the supply of RealD eyewear from manufacturers, increase in shipping costs, logistics or recycling interruption, other disruption to our global supply chain or competitive pricing pressures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. For example, in connection with major 3D motion picture releases and increased consumer demand, we have in the past exhausted our inventory of RealD eyewear and incurred increased shipping costs to accelerate delivery of new inventory.\nOur RealD 3D eyewear business model in North America and a limited number of countries internationally rely on financial support from motion picture studios for the RealD eyewear that are provided to theater customers, and the uncertainty and any potential dispute between motion picture studios and exhibitors could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nOur RealD eyewear is an integral part of our RealD Cinema Systems. In North America, we provide our RealD eyewear free of charge to motion picture exhibitors and then receive a fee from the motion picture studios for the usage of that RealD eyewear by the motion picture exhibitors\u2019 customers. In certain territories, motion picture studios provide financial support directly to theater operators for the RealD eyewear that are used by their customers. Elsewhere, motion picture exhibitors purchase RealD eyewear directly from us and sell them to customers as part of their admission or as a concession. While we support multiple business models for our RealD eyewear around the world, the uncertainty and any potential dispute between motion picture studios and exhibitors over the eyewear business model, whether domestically or internationally, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. In addition, we expect that profitability in our RealD eyewear business may not be sustainable, as motion picture studios with whom we do business seek to recover our cost savings and efficiencies in the form of reduced prices for eyewear.\nEconomic conditions beyond our control could reduce consumer demand for motion pictures and consumer electronics using our 3D and other visual technologies and, as a result, could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and growth prospects.\nDifficult economic conditions and recessionary periods may lead to a decrease in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preference for lower-cost 2D motion pictures, resulting in lower motion picture box office revenue. In the event of declining box office revenue, motion picture studios may be less willing to release 3D motion pictures and motion picture exhibitors may be less willing to license our RealD Cinema Systems or exhibit 3D motion pictures. Further, a decrease in discretionary consumer spending may adversely affect future demand for consumer electronics products that may use our 3D and other visual technologies and consumer electronics manufacturers may decide to not adopt, limit, delay or cease their use of our 3D and other visual technologies, any of which could cause our business, revenue and growth prospects to suffer.\nThe loss of members of our management could substantially disrupt our business operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contribution by members of our management. A limited number of individuals have primary responsibility for managing our business, including our relationships with motion picture studios and exhibitors. The loss of members of our management, including Michael V. Lewis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or the loss of key employees in our accounting or R&D departments or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business and could substantially disrupt our business operations. In addition, because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our hiring of qualified executives, scientists, engineers or other personnel may cause us or those persons to be subject to lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, improper solicitation of employees, breach of contract or other claims.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income could be subject to certain limitations if our ownership has changed or will change by more than 50%, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability.\nWhile currently subject to a full valuation allowance for purposes of preparing our consolidated financial statements (see the discussion under the heading \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Critical accounting policies and estimates-Deferred tax asset valuation and tax exposures\"), we intend to use our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to reduce any future U.S. corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. In that event, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards could be adversely affected. To the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited under the rules of Section 382, our income could be subject to U.S. corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits.\nFurthermore, we operate both in the United States and in certain jurisdictions outside the United States. Our non-U.S. operations may in the future generate taxable income that is subject to income or other taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are conducted. As of March 31, 2015, we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $18.8 million for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in the year 2019. Each jurisdiction in which we operate may have its own limitations on our ability to utilize such foreign tax credit carryforwards generated in that jurisdiction. Also, we generally cannot utilize net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits generated in one jurisdiction to reduce our liability for taxes in any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may be subject to tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate notwithstanding the existence of net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits in other jurisdictions.\nOur future growth largely depends on gaining increased market share in China and other emerging economies, and we face risks in conducting business in these emerging economies.\nOur future growth largely depends on gaining increased market share in China and other emerging economies. China is the Company's largest and fastest growing market opportunity. As of March 31, 2015, our RealD Cinema Systems were deployed and operated in approximately 2,050 cinema screens in China, with an additional approximately 1,031 screens under contract within this market. We believe that our sales of products and services in China and other emerging economies will expand in the future to the extent that the use of digital technologies increases in these countries, including in movies and theaters, and as consumers there continue to become more affluent. Our inability to penetrate the Chinese market, in particular, may adversely impact our global market share and growth opportunities. We face many risks associated with operating in China and these other emerging economies, in large part due to limited recognition and enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights. As a result, we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights in these emerging economies, where intellectual property rights are more difficult to enforce as compared to the United States, Hong Kong, Japan and Europe. We believe that it is critical that we strengthen existing relationships and develop new relationships with entertainment industry participants worldwide to increase our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights without relying solely on the legal systems in the countries in which we operate. If we are unable to develop, maintain, and strengthen these relationships, our revenue from these countries could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with international trade and currency exchange.\nWe maintain sales, marketing and business operations in foreign countries. Consequently, we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations associated with the local currencies of our foreign business operations, including the Chinese yuan, Russian ruble and Brazilian real. Revenue from our foreign business operations in transactions denominated in local currencies are significant. While we may also derive revenue from our foreign business operations in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of our costs from our foreign operations are denominated in the currency of that foreign location. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could have a material impact on our profitability. In addition, foreign governments may restrict transfers of cash out of the country and control exchange rates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repatriate our earnings, and at exchange rates that are beneficial to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased costs and demands on our management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased costs and demands on our management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies. Upon becoming a public company in July 2010, we began incurring additional general and administrative expenses to comply with the SEC reporting requirements, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The increased costs associated with operating a public company may negatively affect our operating results and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nChanges in accounting may affect our reported earnings and operating income.\nU.S. GAAP and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as revenue recognition, film accounting, accounting for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, accounting for income taxes, and treatment of goodwill or long lived assets, are highly complex and involve many subjective judgments. Changes in these rules, their interpretation, management\u2019s estimates, or changes in our products or business could significantly change our reported future earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations.\nBeginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we modified our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to align with the Adjusted EBITDA definition under our expanded credit facility. As a result, we no longer add back sales and use tax and\nproperty tax to calculate Adjusted EBITDA for financial reporting purposes. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation to net income (loss), the most comparable U.S. GAAP item, see \"Non-U.S. GAAP discussion\" under Item 7 in Part II.\nRisks related to owning our common stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares or at all. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including those factors listed in \"-Risks related to our business and our industry\" and the following:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe public's reaction to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of our competitors;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the domestic and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our Company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our Company or our competitors;\n\u2022\nstrategic action by our competitors; and\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and media companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If litigation is instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources even if such litigation is without merit and regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock (or shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of stock options) into the market in the future could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had 50,433,777 shares of common stock outstanding which are freely tradable, subject to prior registration or qualification for an exemption from registration, including, in the case of shares held by affiliates, compliance with the volume, manner of sale, notice and availability of public information provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Our co-founders and certain other pre-IPO stockholders also have registration rights which enable them to cause us to register for sale shares held by them in the public markets. If our existing security holders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIn addition, as of March 31, 2015, there were 15,557,642 shares underlying options and restricted stock that were issued and outstanding and we have an aggregate of 5,965,443 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity\nincentive plan and employee stock purchase plan. These shares will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various option and warrant agreements, maintenance of applicable registration statements and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act. If additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our stock could decline and it might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nOur co-founders, directors, executive officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of March 31, 2015, our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock, including approximately 13% beneficially owned by Michael V. Lewis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nThese stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control, or have significant influence over, the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control, or have significant influence over, the management and affairs of our Company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, shares that may be issued to satisfy our obligations under our equity incentive plans, shares that may be issued in connection with our acquisition of other companies, assets or technology, or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or preferred voting stock could reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, likely could result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock. In addition, any future issuance of capital stock by us will dilute your economic interest in our Company.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe currently do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock, and we intend to use cash generated from operations to continue to grow our business. Consequently, your only opportunity currently to achieve a positive return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates. Our board of directors may, in the future and at their discretion, authorize the payment of dividends on our common stock depending on various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, any restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law, our contracts and such other factors as are deemed relevant by them.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if they downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our management that some of the stockholders of our Company may deem advantageous. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors (three classes) where only one-third of our board of directors is up for re-election at the annual stockholders meeting each year;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders may only remove directors prior to the expiration of their term upon a supermajority vote of at least 80% of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our board of directors or by our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nprovide that action by written consent of the stockholders may be taken only if the board of directors first approves such action; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, we will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with NYSE rules, for so long as our shares are listed on NYSE, and as otherwise required by the bylaws;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nWe may also adopt a \"poison pill\" stockholder rights plan at any time in response to a potentially hostile bid or for any or no reason due to our available \"blank check\" preferred stock. Additionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \"interested\" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder.", "PERMNO": 12011, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "RLD"}
