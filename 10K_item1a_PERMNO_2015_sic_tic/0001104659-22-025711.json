RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties. In addition to the information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings that we make with the SEC, you should carefully read and consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business, operating results, earnings per share, financial position, cash flows and/or the trading price of our common stock (individually and collectively referred to as our \u201cfinancial performance.\u201d) In addition, our actual financial performance could vary materially from any results expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained in this report, in any of our other filings with the SEC and other communications by us, both written and oral, depending on a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below. It is not possible for us to predict all possible risk factors or the impact these factors could have on us or the extent to which any one factor, or combination of factors, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. The risk factors set forth below are not guarantees that no such conditions exist as of the date of this report and should not be interpreted as an affirmative statement that such risks or conditions have not materialized, in whole or in part.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results for an extended period of time.\nWe are subject to continued risks and uncertainties as a result of, the outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a National Public Health Emergency in March 2020. We experienced significant disruptions to our business as suggested and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders led to the temporary closure of a number of restaurants across our portfolio, while the remaining locations shifted to an off-premise only operating model on an interim basis. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain jurisdictions began allowing the reopening of restaurant dining rooms, and we began to reopen dining rooms across our concepts. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, currently nearly all of our restaurants are operating with no indoor dining capacity restrictions. We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, whether vaccines will be effective at eliminating or slowing the spread of the virus or variants, whether the pandemic will worsen in regions in which we do business, the scope of additional restrictions that may be enacted, to what extent we can maintain sales volumes during or following any mandated social distancing protocols or vaccination or mask mandates and what long-lasting effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the restaurant industry as a whole. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operating results and financial performance will depend on the ongoing effects of the pandemic on consumer spending behavior and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, and the extent to which the pandemic contributes to disruptions in the supply chain and labor cost inflation.\nOur restaurant operations could be further disrupted if any of our restaurant staff members are diagnosed with COVID-19, which has occurred at some of our restaurants, requiring the quarantine of some or all of a restaurant\u2019s staff members and the temporary closure of the affected restaurant. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work due to COVID-19 illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nTo further manage our liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and considering governmental occupancy restrictions limiting our ability to access and use our leased restaurants, during fiscal 2020 we engaged our landlords in discussions to obtain rent relief. As a result, we entered into a number of lease amendments providing relief in the form of deferred and/or abated rent. If occupancy restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic become more prevalent or more restrictive in connection with any reemergence or worsening of outbreaks, we may again seek to engage our landlords in discussions seeking additional rent relief. If these discussions are not successful, we may incur considerable rental expenses without sufficient offsetting operating income. We also may choose to cease operations at certain restaurants where profitability is particularly impacted by challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors. Should we do so, we will incur significant costs associated with lease terminations and our winding down of operations at the affected restaurant(s).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening other risks discussed in this section, including the following:\n\u25cf \u201cThe impact global and domestic economic conditions have on consumer discretionary spending could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cOur inability to grow comparable restaurant sales could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cIf we are unable to protect our reputation, the value of our brands and sales at our restaurants may be negatively impacted, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cOver the past several years we have experienced and continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing business will significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cThe impacts of and our failure to effectively respond to pandemics, epidemics, endemics and other public health emergencies, or food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our food supply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cLabor organizing could harm our operations and competitive position in the restaurant industry, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and public health emergencies could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cOur inability to anticipate and react effectively to changes in the costs of key operating resources may increase our cost of doing business, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cIf we are unable to staff and retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and subject us to increased operating costs, as well as to litigation and other liabilities, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d\n\u25cf \u201cOur stock price could be adversely affected if we continue to be unable to pay dividends or, if paid, if we are unable to increase dividends\u201d\nRisks Related to the Restaurant Industry\nThe impact global and domestic economic conditions have on consumer discretionary spending could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global and domestic economies and will likely continue to negatively impact these economies for some time in the future. Dining out is a discretionary expenditure that historically has been influenced by domestic and global economic conditions. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, these conditions include, but may not be limited to: unemployment, general and industry-specific inflation, consumer confidence, consumer purchasing and saving habits, credit conditions, stock market performance, home values, population growth, household incomes and tax policy. Material changes to governmental policy related to domestic and international fiscal concerns, and/or changes in central bank policies with respect to monetary policy, also could affect consumer discretionary spending. Any factor affecting consumer discretionary spending may influence customer traffic in our restaurants and average check amount, thus potentially having a material impact on our financial performance.\nOur inability to grow comparable restaurant sales could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe strive to increase comparable restaurant sales by improving customer traffic trends and growing average check. Changes in customer traffic and average check amount may be impacted by a variety of factors, including, without limitation: macroeconomic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, that impact consumer discretionary spending; perception of our concepts\u2019 offerings in terms of quality, price, value and service; increased competition; changes in consumer eating habits; the evolving retail landscape, which, for reasons including the COVID-19 pandemic, is becoming increasingly influenced by technology and a growing consumer preference for convenience, value and experience; adverse weather conditions; demographic, economic and other adverse changes in the trade areas in which our restaurants are located and changes in the regulatory environment.\nWe compete directly and indirectly for customer traffic with national and regional casual dining restaurant chains, as well as independently-owned restaurants. In addition, we face competition for customer traffic from fast casual and quick-service restaurants, home delivery services, mobile food service, convenience stores, grocery stores and meal kits that are increasing the quality and variety of their food products in response to customer demand. We believe that many consumers remain focused on value and if our competitors, many of whom have significantly greater resources to market aggressively to customers, promote and deliver a higher degree of perceived value, our customer traffic could suffer.\nWe utilize menu price increases to help offset inflation of key operating costs. However, our menu price increases may not entirely offset increased costs and, if not accepted by customers, menu price increases could result in reduced customer traffic. These risks may become more pronounced as supply shortages and wage inflation increase our costs and may result in our need to implement pricing actions above our historical norms. For instance, due to the cost pressures we are currently experiencing, particularly in commodities, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented price increases above our historical levels to protect margins. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cOur inability to anticipate and react effectively to changes in the costs of key operating resources may increase our cost of doing business, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d).\nOur menu mix could be materially adversely affected if our customers purchase fewer menu items or lower cost menu items to reduce their spend. Unfavorable menu mix shifts could reduce average check amount, negatively impacting our ability to grow comparable restaurant sales.\nIn recent years we have generated a higher mix of sales from off-premise channels as a consumer preference for convenience has increased. This shift of sales to off-premise channels increased significantly while COVID-19 related occupancy restrictions and dining room closures limited our on-premise operations. Sales through the off-premise channel declined in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 as many customers have returned to on-premise dining, whereas consumer behavior had shifted towards the off-premise channel during the prior year due to the pandemic. However, off-premise sales mix remains higher than pre-pandemic levels. We may be unable to sustain current off-premise sales volumes. Growing competition in off-premise channels and any reduction in our ability to differentiate our concepts in these channels could negatively impact our comparable restaurant sales performance.\nIf we are unable to protect our reputation, the value of our brands and sales at our restaurants may be negatively impacted, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur greatest asset is the value of our brands, which is directly linked to our reputation. We must protect our reputation in order to continue to be successful and to grow the value of our brands domestically and internationally.\nNegative publicity directed at any of our brands, regardless of factual basis, such as relating to the quality of our restaurant food or consumer packaged goods, the quality of our restaurant facilities, outbreaks of COVID-19 infections at our restaurants, customer complaints or litigation alleging injury or food-borne illnesses, food tampering or contamination or poor health inspection scores, sanitary or other issues with respect to food processing by us or our suppliers, the condition of our restaurants, labor relations, any failure to comply with applicable regulations or standards, allegations of harassment or disparate treatment based upon race, gender, national origin, religion or other class, allegations of sexual harassment, politically motivated accusations or other negative publicity, could damage our reputation. Any failure of our third-party delivery provider to represent our brands in a favorable manner could damage our reputation. These concerns are exacerbated by the speed with which negative information can be disseminated through social media. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cAny inability to effectively use and manage social media could harm our marketing efforts as well as our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d). Negative publicity about us could harm our reputation and damage the value of our brands, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOver the past several years we have experienced and continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing business will significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance.\nLow unemployment coupled with increases in minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affecting labor costs, restrictions on legal immigration and a diminishing pool of potential staff members, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and potential staff members choosing to exit the workforce, in general and hospitality industry, in particular, especially in certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe believe it is becoming increasing likely that the United States federal government will significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate the tip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. Should this happen, other jurisdictions that have historically mandated higher wages and greater benefits than what is required under federal law may seek to further increase wages and mandated benefits. In addition to increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages and other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ a large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs. Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase their price for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs.\nOur labor expenses include significant costs related to our self-insured health, pharmacy and dental benefit plans as well as costs to provide COVID-19 testing to our staff members. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficult to project given that material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, may cause health care costs to vary substantially from quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. Any significant changes to the healthcare insurance system could also impact our health care costs. Material increases in health care costs could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWhile we try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements, greater economies of scale and by offering a variety of health plans to our staff members, including lower cost high deductible health plans, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respond to increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nThe impacts of and our failure to effectively respond to pandemics, epidemics, endemics and other public health emergencies, or food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our food supply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted our business and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. While we have taken and are continuing to take a variety of actions to maintain and grow our business during the COVID-19 pandemic, these efforts may not be successful or yield our intended results. The impacts of and our failure to effectively respond to future pandemics, epidemics, endemics and other public health emergencies may also significantly disrupt our business.\nWe also face food safety risks, including the risk of food-borne illness and food contamination (including allergen cross contamination), which are common both in the restaurant industry and the food supply chain. While we dedicate substantial resources and provide training to ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve, these risks cannot be completely eliminated. Additionally, we rely on our network of suppliers to properly handle, store and transport our ingredients for delivery to our restaurants. Any failure by our suppliers, or their suppliers, could cause our ingredients to be contaminated, which could be difficult to detect and put the safety of our food in jeopardy. We freshly prepare our menu items at our restaurants, which may put us at greater risk for food-borne illness and food contamination outbreaks than some of our competitors who use processed foods or commissaries to prepare their food. The risk of food-borne illness also may increase whenever our menu items are served outside of our control, such as by third-party food delivery services, customer take-out or at catered events.\nAdverse publicity or news reports, regardless of accuracy, regarding food quality or safety issues, illness, injury, recalls, health concerns, government or industry findings concerning food products served by us or our licensees or delivered by a third-party for off-premises consumption, or issues stemming from the operation of our restaurants or bakeries, restaurants operated by our licensees, third parties with whom we may co-brand products or who sell or distribute our products, or third parties we may use to procure materials used in our business or to deliver our products, or generally in the food supply chain, could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our brand and reputation, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe demand for and availability and price of certain food items may be adversely impacted if a pathogen, such as coronavirus, Ebola, \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d \u201cSARS,\u201d \u201cswine flu,\u201d avian influenza, norovirus or other virus or bacteria, such as salmonella or E.coli, or if parasites or other toxins infect or are believed to have infected the food supply, including the food supply chain for our restaurants or bakery facilities. Additionally, customers may avoid our restaurants and it may become difficult to adequately staff our restaurants if our customers or staff members become infected with a pathogen which was actually or claimed to be contracted at our restaurants. Any adverse food safety occurrence may result in litigation against us. Although we carry liability and other insurance coverage to mitigate costs we may incur as a result of these risks, not all risks of this nature are fully insurable. Even if insured, the negative publicity associated with such an event could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn addition to selling products throughout the world through various distribution channels, including, without limitation, supermarkets, mass market retailers, club stores and various other food service and retail channels, our two bakery facilities are the only sources of most of our baked desserts to our restaurants. If any of our bakery products becomes subject to a product recall or market withdrawal, whether voluntary or involuntary, our costs to conduct such recall or market withdrawal could be significant, restaurant sales as well as third-party sales of bakery product could be negatively impacted and our reputation could be damaged, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn addition, any adverse food safety event could result in mandatory or voluntary product withdrawals or recalls, regulatory and other investigations, and/or criminal fines and penalties, any of which could disrupt our operations, increase our costs, require us to respond to findings from regulatory agencies that may divert resources and assets, and result in potential civil fines and penalties as well as other legal action, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Each of our restaurants is subject to various laws and regulations, including license and permit requirements, that regulate many aspects of our business, including, among other things, alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, labor, immigration, zoning and public safety. Our failure to obtain and/or retain licenses, permits or other regulatory approvals required to operate our business could delay or prevent the opening and/or continued operation of any of our restaurants or bakeries, materially adversely affecting that facility\u2019s operations and profitability and our ability to obtain similar licenses, permits or approvals elsewhere, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are also subject to various environmental regulations governing areas such as water usage, sanitation disposal and transportation mitigation. The United States and other countries are expanding the type, nature and scope of laws and regulations governing other environmental matters, such as climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emission and water consumption. We may incur significant additional costs to comply with these laws and regulations and may incur legal liability in the event of our failure to do so.\nOur international business exposes us to additional laws and regulations, including antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott legislation, import/export and customs regulations and other international trade regulations, privacy laws, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nAs a provider of food products, we are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework that governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States , including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of 2002, the Federal Food Safety Modernization Act and regulations concerning nutritional labeling under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Restaurant Industry - \u201cOur inability to respond appropriately to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations, and to adapt to evolving consumer dining preferences could negatively impact our operations and competitive position, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\u201d)\nIn order to serve alcoholic beverages in our restaurants or off-premise where permitted, we must comply with alcoholic beverage control regulations which require us to apply to a state or other governmental alcoholic beverage control authority for licenses and permits. In addition, we are subject to dram shop statutes in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Dram shop litigation may result in significant judgments, including punitive damages.\nVarious federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations govern our operations as they relate to our staff members, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks, scheduling, exempt classifications, equal pay, overtime, tip credits, fringe benefits, leaves, safety, working conditions, provision of health insurance, the COVID-19 pandemic and citizenship or work authorization requirements. Significant increases in minimum wage rates, including the tip credit wage rate in certain states, paid or unpaid leaves of absence, equal wage legislation, mandatory sick pay and paid time off regulations in a growing number of jurisdictions, mandated health and/or COBRA benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to our staff members who receive gratuities, or changes in interpretations of existing employment law, including with respect to classification of exempt versus non-exempt employees, could significantly increase our labor costs, which would materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn California, we are subject to the Private Attorneys General Act (\u201cPAGA\u201d) which authorizes employees to file lawsuits to recover civil penalties on behalf of themselves, other employees and the State of California for labor code violations. We must also comply with local, state and federal laws and regulations protecting the right to equal employment opportunities and prohibiting discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and failure to comply could create exposure to government proceedings and litigation. Even a perceived failure to comply could result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are also subject to the regulations of the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Despite our efforts to maintain compliance with legal requirements, including implementation of electronic verification of legal work status, some of our staff members may not meet legal citizenship or residency requirements. In addition, immigration-related employment regulations may make it more difficult for us to identify and hire qualified staff members. Our inability to maintain an experienced and qualified work force comprised of individuals who meet all legal citizenship or residency requirements could result in a disruption in our work force, sanctions against us and adverse publicity, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur facilities must comply with applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d) and related federal, state and foreign laws and regulations which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud.\nMany laws and regulations governing our business and operations also extend to independent third-party service providers we engage to perform certain services. While we take precautions to ensure that our third-party service providers comply with applicable laws and to maintain an independent contractor relationship, we cannot be assured such efforts will be successful, and we may incur liability vicariously as a joint employer for failures by our independent third-party service providers to comply with applicable laws. Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced (or may be planning to introduce) legislation seeking to mandate an employment relationship between companies that facilitate third-party delivery services and their service personnel. If these measures are successful, delivery costs will significantly increase and/or these companies may choose to no longer operate within such jurisdictions, either of which result could significantly impact our off-premise sales.\nAny changes to the numerous laws governing our business or operations may create challenges for us. While we subscribe to certain services and have established procedures to identify legal and regulatory changes, we cannot be certain to identify and comply with every change on a timely basis. We may incur penalties and other costs, sanctions and adverse publicity by failing to comply with applicable laws, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur inability to respond appropriately to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations, and to adapt to evolving consumer dining preferences, could negatively impact our operations and competitive position, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFederal law requires restaurant operators with twenty or more locations to make certain nutritional information available to customers. Additionally, some state, local and foreign governments also have enacted legislation regulating or prohibiting the sale of or mandating disclosures relating to certain types and/or levels of ingredients in food served in restaurants, such as trans fats, sodium, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and gluten, and are taxing or considering taxing and/or otherwise regulating high fat, high sugar and high sodium foods. While it remains unclear if and to what extent consumers may reconsider dining preferences in response to such requirements, it is clear that consumer dining preferences continue to evolve, and these preferences may evolve more rapidly in response to any of these new requirements. Our failure to quickly and effectively adapt to any significant shift in consumer dining preference could cause our or our licensee\u2019s restaurants to lose market share, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nLabor organizing could harm our operations and competitive position in the restaurant industry, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur staff members and others may attempt to unionize our workforce, establish boycotts or picket lines or interrupt our supply chains which could limit our ability to manage our workforce effectively and cause disruptions to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our labor costs may significantly increase if we become unable to effectively manage our workforce and the compensation and benefits we offer to our staff members, which also could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and public health emergencies could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and public health emergencies can impact customer traffic, make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants and, more severe cases, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, blizzards, wildfires and other natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in and may in the future result in restaurant closures, underutilization of outdoor patio dining and curtailed operations, impediments to availability of staff and supplies and increased commodity costs, sometimes for prolonged periods of time. These effects may become more pronounced in the future as climatologists predict climate change and global warming may cause extended droughts and certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters to become more frequent, more severe and less predictable over time. Our cash flows may be negatively impacted by delay in the receipt of proceeds under any insurance policies or programs we maintain against certain of these risks or the proceeds may not fully offset any such losses. Any or all these situations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nActs of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including civil unrest, customer intimidation, active shooter situations and terrorism, could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny act of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including civil unrest, customer intimidation, active shooter situations and terrorist activities, may result in damage and restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur inability to anticipate and react effectively to changes in the costs of key operating resources may increase our cost of doing business, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations based on market prices established with our suppliers. Many of these commodities can be subject to market volatility driven by supply and demand factors outside of our control, including the relative availability of labor and distribution, weather, natural disasters, inventory levels, and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate a number of these factors. We negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for some of our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, such as certain dairy products and poultry, depending on market conditions and expected demand. Recently, these efforts have been hampered by supply shortages caused by supply chain challenges that have affected the restaurant industry and broader economy. As a result, we have needed to purchase a greater portion of certain products in the spot market at a significantly higher cost than our historical contracted rates. While we are in the process of contracting for certain key food and non-food supplies for fiscal 2022, these efforts may not be successful or yield our intended benefits. Due to the cost pressures we are currently experiencing, particularly in commodities, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented price increases above our historical levels to protect margins. We will continue to consider the cost environment and consumer price sensitivity when evaluating future menu price increases. However, we can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful.\nWe continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into similar arrangements for other commodities and periodically evaluate hedging vehicles, such as direct financial instruments, to assist us in managing price risk and variability associated with such commodities. Although these vehicles may be available to us, as of the end of fiscal 2021, we had no hedging contracts in place. Commodities for which we have not entered into contracts can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations, which at times may be significant. Additionally, the cost of commodities subject to governmental regulation, such as dairy and corn, can be especially susceptible to price fluctuation. Commodities we purchase on the international market may be subject to even greater fluctuations in cost and availability, which could result from a variety of factors, including the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, international trade disputes, tariffs and varying global demand.\nWhile we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our principal commodity, supply, service and equipment requirements, because certain of these products and services may only be available from a few vendors or service providers, we may not always be able to do so. Because of this lack of competition, we may be vulnerable to excessive price demands, especially as they relate to the cost of products or services that are critical to our operations or profitability.\nCertain products and ingredients commonly used in food preparation are under scrutiny for possibly posing social and environmental risks, such as from an animal welfare and sustainability perspective. We use many of these products and ingredients and have adopted a comprehensive Sustainable Sourcing Policy under which, among other things, we commit to a buying preference by 2025, or sooner where required, for products and ingredients that are sustainably grown and harvested and which do not have negative social impact, and for products from animals that are humanely raised and processed (\u201csustainable products\u201d). While we are committed to implementing these changes in as timely and commercially feasible manner as possible, there is a risk that some of our products or ingredients may become the subject of adverse media attention before we are able to do so, regardless of factual basis. Additionally, while we make significant efforts to ensure we will have a sufficient ongoing supply of sustainable products at a reasonable cost, since there is currently a smaller market for certain of these products, they may be especially susceptible to cost volatility and supply fluctuations. We cannot be certain that our supply and cost mitigation efforts or commitment to purchase sustainable products will be successful.\nOur international licensees are also subject to commodity price fluctuations. While they too employ strategies to mitigate the impact these fluctuations have on their business, neither we nor they can be assured such strategies will be successful. Commodity price fluctuations could impede our international licensees\u2019 profitability and hamper their ability to grow, which could negatively impact our ability to expand our brand internationally.\nOur financial performance could be materially adversely affected if we fail to retain, or effectively respond to a loss of, key executives.\nThe success of our business continues to depend in critical respects on the contributions of David Overton, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and our other senior executives. The departure of Mr. Overton or other senior executives for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and long-term strategic plan. We have a succession plan that includes short-term and long-term planning elements intended to allow us to successfully continue operations should any of our senior management become unavailable to serve in their respective roles. However, there is a risk that we may not be able to implement the succession plan successfully or in a timely manner or that the succession plan will not result in the same financial performance we currently achieve under the guidance of our existing executive team.\nIf we are unable to staff and retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nSimilar to the restaurant industry and broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce as we have reopened our dining rooms after the lifting of mandatory, social-distancing regulations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and expanded bakery production. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants and bakery operations could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, and our ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers\u2019 demand for bakery goods could be limited, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf any of our third-party vendors experiences a failure that affects a significant aspect of our business, we may experience data loss, increased costs or other harm, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn order to leverage our internal resources and information technology infrastructure, and to support our business continuity and disaster recovery planning efforts, we rely on third-party vendors to provide some of our essential business processes. For example, we rely on a network of third-party distribution warehouses to deliver ingredients and other materials to our restaurants. In some instances, these processes rely on technology and may be outsourced to the vendor in their entirety and in other instances we utilize these vendors\u2019 externally-hosted business applications. Our vendors\u2019 systems have experienced cyber security breaches and may again be vulnerable to a variety of risks, including, without limitation, theft, casualties such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms, malware, ransomware, breaches of the algorithms they or their third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect data and other malicious or disruptive events (each, a \u201cSecurity Incident\u201d and collectively, \u201cSecurity Incidents\u201d).\nWe also utilize third parties to provide gift card distribution and transaction processing services and to perform food delivery services. We derive substantial revenue from these aspects of our business, which could suffer in the event of any factor that adversely impacts our vendors\u2019 ability to provide such services. Such factors may include, without limitation, loss of, or significant change in contractual terms of, key vendor contracts, vendor or processor failures, technology failures, damage to the reputation of any key vendor and mandated employment relationships between companies that facilitate third-party delivery services and their service personnel. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cChanges in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\u201d)\nWe continue to review options to expand the use of third-party providers in other areas. Our practice is to work with service providers that are leading performers in their industries and with technology vendors that employ up-to-date and appropriate data security practices and internal control practices. However, we cannot guarantee that failures will not occur. The failure of third-party vendors to provide adequate services, including, as result of any Security Incident, could significantly harm our operations and reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition (\u201cAcquisition\u201d) of North Italia and the remaining business of Fox Restaurant Concepts LLC (\u201cFRC\u201d) could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn 2019, we acquired FRC\u2019s businesses with the expectation that the Acquisition will result in various benefits including, among others, business and growth opportunities and synergies in supply chain, real estate and other areas over time. Combining independent companies with separate businesses, customers, employees, cultures and systems is a complex, costly and time-consuming process.\nThere can be no assurances that we will realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, within the anticipated timeframes, if at all. In addition, we may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business, we may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, and general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. If any of these or other expected or unexpected factors limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, or if such business opportunities, growth prospects and synergies are not realized for any other reason, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur additional costs if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases on similar terms and conditions, or at all, or to relocate our restaurants in certain trade areas, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe currently lease all our restaurant premises and, although we may consider other arrangements, we currently plan to continue to lease our restaurant locations in the future. Some of our leases have terms that will expire in the next few years and beyond. Many of these leases include renewal options; some do not. While lease expirations allow us to opportunistically evaluate the possibility of relocating certain restaurants to higher quality sites and trade areas over time, doing so may involve additional costs, such as increased rent and other expenses related to renegotiating the terms of occupancy of an existing lease, and the costs to relocate and develop a replacement restaurant if we choose not to renew a lease, or are unable to do so, on favorable terms in a desirable location. In addition, we may elect to terminate certain leases prior to their expiration dates, and we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for such early terminations. Additional costs related to expiring restaurant lease terms, our inability to terminate certain restaurant leases under favorable terms or the unavailability of suitable replacement locations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny inability to effectively use and manage social media could harm our marketing efforts as well as our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nSocial media provides a powerful medium for consumers, staff members and others to communicate their approval of or displeasure with a business. This aspect of social media is especially challenging because it allows any individual to reach a broad audience with an ability to respond or react, in near real time, with comments that are often not filtered or checked for accuracy. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond, any negative publicity could \u201cgo viral\u201d causing nearly immediate and potentially significant harm to our brand and reputation, whether or not factually accurate.\nOur marketing strategy includes an emphasis on social media. As social media continues to grow in popularity, many of our competitors have expanded and improved their use of social media, making it more difficult for us to differentiate our social media messaging. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies.\nIf we do not appropriately use and manage our social media strategies, our marketing efforts in this area may not be successful, and any failure to effectively respond to negative or potentially damaging social media, whether accurate or not, could damage our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe own and have applied to register trade names, logos, service marks, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property (collectively, \u201cIntellectual Property\u201d), including The Cheesecake Factory\u00ae, North Italia\u00ae, a collection within the Fox Restaurant Concepts subsidiary and other trademarks related to our restaurant and bakery businesses in the United States and in additional countries throughout the world. Our Intellectual Property is valuable to our business and requires continuous monitoring to protect. We regularly and systemically search for misappropriations of our Intellectual Property and seek to enforce our rights whenever appropriate to do so; however, we cannot be assured of success in every case and cannot possibly find all infringing uses of our Intellectual Property. Furthermore, we have not registered all our Intellectual Property throughout the world, as doing so may not be feasible because of associated costs, various foreign trademark law prohibitions or registrations by others. Our failure or inability to protect our Intellectual Property worldwide could limit our ability to globally expand our brand.\nOur inability to effectively protect our Intellectual Property domestically or internationally could cause our customers to believe lesser quality products or services are ours, may reduce the capacity of our Intellectual Property to uniquely identify our products and services and/or may limit our ability to globally expand our brand, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe face a variety of risks and challenges related to our international operations and global brand development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nInternational operations have a unique set of risks and challenges that differ from country to country, and can include, among other risks, political instability, governmental corruption, social, religious and ethnic unrest, anti-American sentiment, delayed and potentially less effective ability to respond to a crisis occurring internationally, changes in global economic conditions (such as currency valuation, disposable income, unemployment levels and increases in the prices of commodities and labor), the regulatory environment, immigration, labor and pension laws, income and other taxes, consumer preferences and practices, as well as changes in the laws and regulations governing foreign investment, joint ventures or licensing arrangements in countries where our restaurants or licensees are located and local import controls.\nOperations at our international Company-owned and licensed restaurants may be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf difficulties in achieving the consistency of product quality and service as compared to restaurants we operate in the United States;\n\u25cf changes to our recipes required by cultural norms;\n\u25cf inability to obtain, at a reasonable cost, adequate and reliable supplies of ingredients and products necessary to execute our diverse menu;\n\u25cf availability of experienced management to operate international restaurants according to our domestic standards;\n\u25cf changes in economic conditions of our licensees, whether or not related to the operation of our restaurants;\n\u25cf differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, immigration, social, climatic, and political conditions, including the possibility of terrorism, social unrest, trade embargos and/or trade restrictions, which may result in periodic or permanent closure of foreign restaurants, affect our ability to supply our international restaurants with necessary supplies and ingredients and affect international perception of our brand;\n\u25cf inability of our licensees to locate profitable or suitable sites for development;\n\u25cf rising cost and scarcity of labor world-wide;\n\u25cf exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25cf currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, taxes or tariffs adversely affecting our or our licensees\u2019 ability to import goods from the United States and other parts of the world that are required for operating our branded restaurants, including our cakes which are wholly manufactured in the United States.\nOur international licensees are authorized to operate The Cheesecake Factory restaurant concept in licensed trade areas using certain of our Intellectual Property, including our proprietary systems. We provide extensive and detailed training to our licensees so their staff members may be able to effectively execute our operating processes and procedures and periodically audit their performance and adherence to our requirements. However, because we do not operate these restaurants directly, we can provide no assurance that our licensees will adhere to our operating standards to the same extent as we would.\nIf we or our licensees fail to effectively operate our international restaurants, or if we or they fail to receive an adequate return on investment, and these difficulties are attributed to us or our brand, our reputation and brand value could be harmed, our revenues from these restaurants could be diminished and our international growth may be slowed, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn order to support our international expansion, our bakeries supply certain of our bakery products to our branded international restaurants. In order to supply bakery products to restaurants in other countries, we may be required to adapt certain recipes to eliminate locally prohibited ingredients, comply with labeling requirements that differ from those in the United States and maintain certifications required to export to such countries. In addition, unexpected events outside of our control, such as, without limitation, trade restrictions, import and export embargos, governmental shutdowns and disruptions in shipping, may affect our ability to transport adequate levels of our bakery products to our or our licensee\u2019s international restaurants, for which we are the sole source of supply. A failure to adequately supply bakery products to our or our licensee\u2019s international restaurants could affect the customer experience at those restaurants, resulting in decreased sales, and could, depending upon the reason for the failure, trigger contractual defaults on our part, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs we continue to expand our brand internationally, we must comply with regulations and legal requirements, including those related to immigration and the protection of our Intellectual Property. Additionally, we must comply with domestic laws affecting U.S. businesses that operate internationally, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-boycott laws, and with foreign laws in the countries in which we expand our restaurants. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cChanges in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\u201d) We may incur considerable liability in the event we or our licensees fail to comply with foreign or domestic laws relating to our or their operation of any international restaurant and can provide no assurance that our insurance programs or contractual indemnification rights would be effective to protect against such liabilities.\nWe may engage in expansion opportunities or other initiatives which may create risks to our business that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may engage in other means to leverage our competitive strengths, including expansion of our brand to other retail opportunities and/or other initiatives. Many risks are inherent in any such development, investment arrangement, expansion of our brand or other initiative, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf damaging our reputation if retail products bearing our brand are not of the same value and quality that our customers associate with our brand;\n\u25cf dilution of the goodwill associated with our brand as it become more common and increasingly accessible;\n\u25cf inaccurate assessment of value, growth potential, weaknesses, liabilities, contingent or otherwise, and expected profitability of such ventures; and\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention and focus from existing operations to the expansion of our brand to non-restaurant items.\nIf we do not appropriately scale our infrastructure in a timely manner, we may be unable to respond to and support our domestic or international opportunities for growth, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe continually evaluate the appropriate level of infrastructure necessary to support our operational and development plans, including our domestic and international expansion. Likewise, if sales decline, we may be unable to reduce our infrastructure quickly enough to prevent sales deleveraging. Either circumstance could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur international license agreements require us to provide training and support to our licensees for their development and operation of The Cheesecake Factory restaurants. We have dedicated certain corporate personnel to international development and continue to utilize the talents of existing management, as we grow our international licensing and operations infrastructure. In addition, one of the most important aspects of our restaurant operations is our ability to deliver dependable, quality service by experienced staff members who can execute our concepts according to our high standards. This may require training our licensees\u2019 management in the United States and our licensees\u2019 staff members in the licensed territories, as well as providing support in the selection and development of restaurant sites, product sourcing logistics, technological systems, menu modification and other areas. If, for any reason, we are unable to provide the appropriate level of infrastructure support to our international licensees, our licensee\u2019s operations could suffer, which could make it more difficult for us to grow our brand internationally and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe have and may again be required to record impairment charges, be unable to fully recoup landlord improvement allowances and/or decide to discontinue operations at certain restaurants, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe assess the potential impairment of our long-lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, negative cash flow, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. At any given time, we may be monitoring a number of locations, and future impairment charges and/or closures may occur if individual restaurant performance does not improve, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 for further discussion of impairment of long-lived assets.)\nWe test our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate a potential impairment. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, historical financial performance, a significant decline in expected future cash flows, unanticipated competition, changes in management or key personnel, macroeconomic and industry conditions and the legal and regulatory environment. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of these assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance. (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 for further discussion of impairment of intangible assets.)\nA portion of our tenant allowances at certain premises may be subject to recoupment against percentage rent otherwise payable for such sites. When we are unable to achieve sales in a sufficient amount to generate percentage rent obligations, we are not able to fully recoup available allowances at affected sites, which also could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur inability to secure an adequate number of high-quality sites for future restaurant openings could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nOur ability to grow our business depends on the availability and selection of high-quality sites that meet our criteria. The number and timing of new restaurants opened during any given period, and their associated contribution to the growth of our business, will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf unforeseen delays due to market conditions;\n\u25cf the identification and availability of high-quality locations;\n\u25cf an increase in competition for available premier locations;\n\u25cf the influence of consumer shopping trends on the availability of sites in traditional locations, such as premier shopping centers;\n\u25cf acceptable lease terms and the lease negotiation process;\n\u25cf the availability of suitable financing for our landlords;\n\u25cf the financial viability of our landlords;\n\u25cf timing of the delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to perform build-out construction activities;\n\u25cf the ability of our landlords and us to obtain all necessary governmental licenses and permits, and consents of third parties, on a timely basis to construct and operate our restaurants;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully manage the complex design, construction and preopening processes for our highly customized restaurants;\n\u25cf the availability and/or cost of raw materials and labor used in construction;\n\u25cf the availability of qualified tradespeople in the local market;\n\u25cf any unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises; and\n\u25cf adverse weather or other delays during the construction period.\nIf we are unable to manage risks related to our business, costs associated with litigation and insurance could increase, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters typically involve claims by customers, staff members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, dram shop liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry. We could be materially adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Employment-related litigation, particularly with respect to claims styled as class action lawsuits, are especially costly to defend. Also, some employment-related claims in the area of wage and hour disputes are not insurable risks and many employment-related disputes involve uncertainty in judicial interpretation from state to state and from federal to state court with respect to the effectiveness of arbitration agreements with our staff members, particularly those which provide for class waivers. In recent year, we have experienced an increase in wage and hour litigation, in particular in California, where we have seen an increase in claims filed under California\u2019s Private Attorneys General Act (\u201cPAGA\u201d). PAGA allows an aggrieved staff member to bring a lawsuit on behalf of other current and former staff members for labor code violations, including certain technical violations. PAGA claims are not subject to arbitration and may result in exposure to additional penalties, which can be assessed separately from recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that are not insured or are in excess of insurance coverage can materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe retain financial responsibility for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, staff member health benefits, employment practices and certain other insurable risks. Several factors may significantly increase our self-insurance costs, such as conditions of the insurance market, the availability of insurance, or changes in applicable regulations. The accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our annual estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us (\u201cIBNR\u201d). Significant judgment is required to estimate IBNR amounts, as parties have yet to assert such claims. Our financial performance may be materially adversely affected if our actual claims costs significantly exceed our estimates.\nOur inability or failure to execute on comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans following a major disaster could interfere with our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAll our core and critical applications are housed in an external tier 3 data center, which is a location with redundant and dual-powered servers, storage, network links and other IT components. To mitigate business interruptions, we employ a disk-based data backup and replication infrastructure between our onsite and external data centers. We provide support for our restaurant operations, with the exception of design and construction, from our corporate headquarters in Calabasas, California, an area that is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and wildfires. Corporate support for our bakery operations is also performed from this centralized location. If we are unable to execute our disaster recovery procedures in whole or in part, we may experience delays in recovery and losses of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal operating procedures that could expose us to administrative and other legal claims, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nA closure of or material damage to one or both of our bakery facilities could impede our ability to supply bakery products to our own and our international licensees\u2019 restaurants as well as to other bakery customers. Such an incident could also result in the loss of critical data regarding our bakery operations. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cyber Security\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and subject us to increased operating costs, as well as to litigation and other liabilities, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely heavily on our in-restaurant and enterprise-wide computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations (\u201cCyber Environment\u201d), which could be vulnerable to various risks. This reliance has grown since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as we have had to rely to a greater extent on systems such as online ordering, contactless payments, online reservations, systems supporting a remote workforce and the like. The efficient management of our operations depends upon our ability to protect our Cyber Environment against damage from theft, casualties such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from Security Incidents. We employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our Cyber Environment to reduce the likelihood of any Security Incident and have developed a multi-discipline Security Incident response plan to help ensure that our executives are fully and accurately informed and manage, with the help of content experts, the discovery, investigation and auditing of, and recovery from any Security Incidents. Despite these efforts, we can provide no assurance that these measures will successfully prevent any Security Incident or mitigate losses resulting from a Security Incident. We have completed our assessment of the information technology systems and infrastructure for the FRC brands and are in the process of implementing recommended improvements. We will continue to have greater degree of risk with respect to the acquired systems and infrastructure until we have implemented all recommended improvements.\nOur international licensees have access to certain elements of our intellectual property within their Cyber Environment and may not have developed adequate processes to secure their Cyber Environments against a Security Incident and may not maintain robust discovery, investigation, auditing or recovery protocols, or have the ability to promptly and effectively respond to a Security Incident. Available cyber-risk insurance coverage and policy limits may not adequately cover or compensate us in the event of a Security Incident. Our financial performance could be materially adversely affected if our operations are interrupted by a Security Incident from which we are not able to promptly and fully recover, if any cyber-risk insurance is unable to fully address our losses and/or if we become subjected to litigation or regulatory action because of such an incident.\nOur inability to maintain a secure environment for customers\u2019 and staff members\u2019 personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and staff members. For example, we transmit confidential credit card information in connection with credit card transactions, and we are required to collect and maintain certain personal information in connection with our employment practices, including the administration of our benefit plans. Our collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure and security of this information is regulated by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020, provides California residents broad rights with respect to their personal data, including, the right to know about the personal information a business collects about them, the right to delete personal information collected from them, the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information and the right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights. In addition, the CCPA provides a private right of action for certain data breaches coupled with statutory damages under certain circumstances. Compliance with the CCPA and other laws relating to the protection of personal information involve significant costs and could result in significant liability in the event we allow an unauthorized disclosure of personal information.\nIf a Security Incident were to occur involving loss of or inappropriate access to or dissemination of such personal information, we may become liable under applicable law for damages (including statutory damages) and incur penalties and other costs to remedy such an incident. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such an incident, these damages, penalties and costs could be significant and may not be covered by insurance or could exceed our applicable insurance coverage limits. Such an event also could harm our reputation and result in litigation against us. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment depends on us remaining compliant with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI). These standards require certain levels of Cyber Environment security and procedures to protect our customers\u2019 credit card and other personal information. At The Cheesecake Factory, North Italia, Grand Lux Cafe and Social Monk Asian Kitchen restaurants, we have implemented a robust end-to-end encryption and tokenization technology, a public key infrastructure, ensuring only trusted devices can access our network, and Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention (IDS/IPS) that scans data in transit detecting and preventing the execution of harmful code. In addition, we utilize a third-party security operations center (SOC) provider to monitor and analyze internal network traffic for potential malicious content. However, we can provide no assurance that our security measures will be successful in the event of an attempted or actual Security Incident. If these security measures are not successful, we may become subject to litigation or the imposition of regulatory penalties, which could result in negative publicity and significantly harm our reputation, either of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We have completed our assessment of the information technology systems and infrastructure for the FRC brands and are in the process of implementing recommended improvements. We will continue to have greater degree of risk with respect to the acquired systems and infrastructure until we have implemented all recommended improvements.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nAny failure to satisfy financial covenants and/or repayment requirements under our credit facility could harm our financial condition.\nOn March 30, 2021, we entered into a Second Amendment (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d) to our existing Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated July 30, 2019 (as amended by that certain First Amendment, dated as of May 1, 2020 and by the Second Amendment, collectively, the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d), that, among other changes, extended the prior covenant relief period during which the testing of the net adjusted debt to earning before income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (\u201cEBITDAR\u201d) ratio covenant and the EBITDAR to interest and rent expense ratio covenant is suspended through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Following the end of the covenant relief period, in addition to a material decrease in EBITDAR, a material increase in our level of debt could cause our net adjusted leverage ratio and EBITDAR to interest and rent expense coverage ratios to be outside of permitted levels under the covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement, which terminates on July 30, 2024, consists of a $400 million revolving loan facility (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d), including a $40 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Amended Credit Agreement also provides the ability to increase the Revolving Facility in an amount not to exceed $200 million. The funding of any such increases are subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent. Certain of our material subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nAny failure to maintain debt covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement or to have sufficient liquidity to either repay or refinance the then outstanding balance at expiration of the Amended Credit Agreement, or upon any violation of the covenants, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 for further discussion of our long-term debt.)\nIn addition, our increased indebtedness related to the Acquisition and our resulting higher debt-to-equity ratio, as compared to that which has existed on a historical basis, could limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and have other material consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, changing business and market conditions, making us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to use proceeds from any offering or divestiture transaction for purposes other than the repayment of debt; and, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with less indebtedness.\nThe indenture governing our outstanding Notes will not restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness, and the Notes and the incurrence of any additional indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.\nIn June 2021, we completed the offering of $345.0 million aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due 2026 (\u201cNotes\u201d) and issued $175.0 million of shares of our common stock (the \u201cIssuance\u201d). The Notes and Issuance are collectively referred to as the \u201cOfferings.\u201d We used the net proceeds from the Offerings to fund approximately $457.3 million payable in connection with the cash-settled conversion of 150,000 shares of our previously outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock and the share-settled conversion of the remaining 50,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock into approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock. (See Notes 12 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of these events.)\nAs of December 28, 2021, we had approximately $475.0 million in principal amount of consolidated indebtedness. We incurred $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional indebtedness as a result of the offering of the Notes. The indenture governing the Notes does not contain any meaningful restrictive covenants and does not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness in the future. Accordingly, we may incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. The incurrence of indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u25cf requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n\u25cf diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and\n\u25cf placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and the Notes.\nWe have the right to elect to settle conversion of the Notes either entirely in cash or in combination of cash and shares of common stock. Our election to convert Notes into common stock may further dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders and/or reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, the market\u2019s expectation that conversions may occur could depress the trading price of our common stock even in the absence of actual conversions. Moreover, the expectation of conversions could encourage the short selling of our common stock, which could place further downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may also conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock to finance our operations or fund acquisitions, or for other purposes. In addition, we have reserved approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock for grant under our The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Stock Incentive Plan as of December 28, 2021. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, if any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or if the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock may significantly decline. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nHedging activity by investors in the Notes could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nWe expect that many investors in the Notes, including potential purchasers of the Notes, will seek to employ a convertible note arbitrage strategy. Under this strategy, investors typically short sell a certain number of shares of our common stock and adjust their short position over time while they continue to hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of, or in addition to, short selling shares of our common stock. This market activity, or the market\u2019s perception that it will occur, could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in the indenture governing the Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (which is defined in the indenture governing the Notes to include certain change-of-control events and the delisting of our common stock), then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d (which is defined in the indenture governing the Notes to include, among other events, fundamental changes and certain additional business combination transactions), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate for the Notes. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholder holders of our common stock may view as favorable.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness limits our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nNoteholders of our outstanding Notes may, subject to limited exceptions, require us to repurchase their Notes following a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (which is defined in the indenture governing the Notes) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, all conversions of the Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the Amended Credit Agreement or any future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. For example, the Amended Credit Agreement restricts us from paying cash upon conversion of the Notes in an amount that exceeds the principal amount being converted. Furthermore, the Amended Credit Agreement places several restrictions on our ability to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Under the Amended Credit Agreement we are permitted to repurchase Notes upon a fundamental change only if (i) no default of event of default exists and (ii) our pro forma net adjusted leverage ratio (as measured in accordance with the revolving credit facility) does not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 and our EBITDAR to interest and rental expense ratio (as measured in accordance with the revolving credit facility) is at least 1.90 to 1.00.\nOur failure to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes. A default under the indenture governing the Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the Amended Credit Agreement and agreements governing our other or future indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the such indebtedness and the Notes.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the price of our common stock fluctuated between $34.64 and $65.81 per share. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or those of our competitors as compared to analyst expectations, changes in financial estimates by research analysts with respect to us or others in the restaurant industry, and announcements of significant transactions (including mergers or acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives) by us or others in the restaurant industry. In addition, the equity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that affect the stock price of companies in ways that have been unrelated to an individual company\u2019s operating performance. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, based on factors specific to our company and industry, as well as factors related to the equity markets overall.\nOur stock price could be adversely affected if our performance falls short of our financial guidance and/or market expectations.\nOur failure to achieve performance consistent with any financial guidance we provide and/or market expectations could adversely affect the price of our stock. Factors such as comparable restaurant sales that are below our target, slowing growth of our concepts domestically, our inability to successfully integrate and realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, execute other growth opportunities, a decline in growth of our international business, any event that causes our operating costs to substantially increase, including, without limitation, any of the events described elsewhere in these Risk Factors, our inability to obtain additional capital at market terms, or our failure to repurchase stock as expected or pay or increase our dividend over time, could cause our performance to fall short of our financial guidance and/or market expectations.\nOur stock price could be adversely affected if we continue to be unable to pay dividends or, if paid, if we are unable to increase dividends.\nTo preserve liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic and in conjunction with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, our Board suspended the quarterly dividend on our common stock. Any future dividends on our common stock will depend on our ability to do so under the Amended Credit Agreement or any future credit agreement as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and capacity to borrow funds, which may be subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our long-term debt.) Continued failure to pay or increase our dividends over time may negatively impact investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nOur stock price could be adversely affected by future sales or other dilution of our equity.\nSubject to Nasdaq Listing Rules, we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue additional shares of common stock and additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the stockholders. The Board of Directors also has the discretion, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation or winding up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred shares that have a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of our common stockholders or the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax laws and resulting regulations could result in changes to our tax provisions and expose us to additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, such as the 2017 enactment of Federal legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (collectively, the \u201cTax Acts\u201d), or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect and changes to state tax laws that may occur in response to the Tax Acts, could affect our tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur failure to establish, maintain and apply adequate internal control over our financial reporting and comply with changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting - a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. There can be no assurance that we will be able to timely remediate material weakness in internal controls (if any) or maintain all of the controls necessary to remain in compliance. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Additionally, changes in accounting standards or new accounting pronouncements and interpretations could materially adversely affect our previously reported or future financial results, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business and stock price could be adversely affected by the actions of activist investors.\nPublicly-traded companies have increasingly become subject to activist investor campaigns. Responding to actions of an activist investor may be a significant distraction for our management and staff and could require us to expend significant time and resources, including legal fees and potential proxy solicitation expenses. Any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 77902, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "CAKE"}
