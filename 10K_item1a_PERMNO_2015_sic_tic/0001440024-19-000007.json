{"cik": "1440024", "company": "Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, investor confidence in our Company, and the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act and based upon the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the \u201cCOSO framework\u201d). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Management is also responsible for reporting on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have not maintained an effective control environment based on the criteria established in the COSO framework. We have identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the control environment of the COSO framework. Specifically, these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) our commitment to integrity and ethical values, (ii) the ability of our board of directors to effectively exercise oversight of the development and performance of internal control, as a result of failure to communicate relevant information within our organization and, in some cases, withholding information, (iii) appropriate organizational structure, reporting lines, and authority and responsibilities in pursuit of objectives, (iv) our commitment to attract, develop, and retain competent individuals, and (v) holding individuals accountable for their internal control related responsibilities. These material weaknesses resulted in material accounting errors.\nWe have not maintained an effective control environment to enable the identification and mitigation of risks of material accounting errors, based on the contributing factors to material weakness in the control environment, including:\n\u2022\nThe tone from former executive management was insufficient to create the proper environment for effective internal control over financial reporting and to ensure that (i) there were adequate processes for oversight, (ii) there was accountability for the performance of internal control over financial reporting responsibilities, (iii) identified issues and concerns were raised to appropriate levels within our organization, (iv) corrective activities were appropriately applied, prioritized, and implemented in a timely manner, and (v) relevant information was communicated within our organization and not withheld from our independent directors, our Audit Committee, and our independent auditors.\n\u2022\nIn certain operating companies and at our corporate headquarters there were inconsistent accounting systems, policies, and procedures. Additionally, in certain locations we did not attract, develop, and retain competent management, accounting, financial reporting, internal audit, and information systems personnel or resources to ensure that internal control responsibilities were performed and that information systems were aligned with internal control objectives.\n\u2022\nOur oversight processes and procedures that guide individuals in applying internal control over financial reporting were not adequate in preventing or detecting material accounting errors, or omissions due to inadequate information and, in certain instances, management override of internal controls, including recording improper accounting entries, recording accounting entries that were inconsistent with information known by management at the time, not communicating relevant information within our organization and, in some cases, withholding information from our independent directors, our Audit Committee, and our independent auditors.\nAdditionally, we have identified control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses in the principles associated with the risk assessment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring activities components of the COSO framework. Refer to Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K for more information.\nAs a result of such material weaknesses, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2018.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are actively engaged in developing and implementing a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses, but our remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. Although we are working to remedy the ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation\nplan will be fully developed or implemented, the effectiveness of the remediation plan, when it will be fully implemented, or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our financing arrangements, and may be required to seek additional amendments or waivers under these financing arrangements, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and our management\u2019s time to comply with applicable requirements.\nAny failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any new misstatement could result in a further restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing, increase the cost of the financing we obtain, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price. We cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nFurther, we may be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the restatement of our previously issued financial results and related matters, and may be adversely impacted by negative reactions from our stockholders, creditors, or others with which we do business. This negative publicity may impact our ability to attract and retain customers, employees, drivers, and vendors. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and reputation and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial results has resulted in private litigation, derivative lawsuits, and government agency investigations and actions, and could result in additional litigation, government agency investigations, and enforcement actions.\nFollowing our press release on January 30, 2017, three putative class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against us and our former officers, Mark A. DiBlasi and Peter R. Armbruster. On May 19, 2017, the Court consolidated the actions under the caption In re Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc. Securities Litigation (Case No. 17-cv-00144), and appointed Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System as lead plaintiff. On March 12, 2018, the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cCAC\u201d) on behalf of a class of persons who purchased our common stock between March 14, 2013 and January 30, 2017, inclusive. The CAC alleges (i) we and Messrs. DiBlasi and Armbruster violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and (ii) Messrs. DiBlasi and Armbruster, our former Chairman Scott Rued, HCI Equity Partners, L.L.C., and HCI Equity Management, L.P. violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, by making or causing to be made materially false or misleading statements, or failing to disclose material facts, regarding (a) the accuracy of our financial statements; (b) our true earnings and expenses; (c) the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and controls over financial reporting; (d) the true nature and depth of financial risk associated with our tractor lease guaranty program; (e) our leverage ratios and compliance with our credit facilities; and (f) the value of the goodwill we carried on our balance sheet. The CAC seeks certification as a class action, compensatory damages, and attorney's fees and costs. On November 19, 2018, the parties entered into a binding term sheet agreeing to settle the action for $20 million, $17.9 million of which will be funded by our D&O carriers ($4.8 million of which is by way of a pass through of the D&O carriers\u2019 payment to us in connection with the settlement of the Federal Derivative Action described below). The parties are finalizing the Stipulation of Settlement. The settlement is conditioned on a settlement of the Federal Derivative Action described below, dismissal of the State Derivative Action described below, and final court approval of the settlements in this action and in the Federal Derivative Action.\nOn May 25, 2017, Richard Flanagan filed a complaint alleging derivative claims on our behalf in the Circuit Court of Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin (Case No. 17-cv-004401) against Scott Rued, Mark DiBlasi, Christopher Doerr, John Kennedy, III, Brian Murray, James Staley, Curtis Stoelting, William Urkiel, Judith Vijums, Michael Ward, Chad Utrup, Ivor Evans, Peter Armbruster, and Brian van Helden (the \u201cState Derivative Action\u201d). Count I of the complaint alleges the Director Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by \u201cknowingly failing to ensure that the Company implemented and maintained adequate internal controls over its accounting and financial reporting functions,\u201d and seeks unspecified damages. Count II of the complaint alleges the Officer Defendants DiBlasi, Armbruster, and van Helden received substantial performance-based compensation and bonuses for fiscal year 2014 that should be disgorged. The action has been stayed pending the District Court\u2019s approval of the proposed settlement of the Federal Derivative Action, following which the defendants would move to dismiss this action as moot. While the case was stayed, the plaintiff obtained permission to file an amended complaint adding claims against two former Company employees: Bret Naggs and Mark Wogsland.\nOn June 28, 2017, Jesse Kent filed a complaint alleging derivative claims on our behalf and class action claims in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On December 22, 2017, Chester County Employees Retirement Fund\nfiled a complaint alleging derivative claims on our behalf in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On March 21, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the Kent and Chester County actions under the caption Kent v. Stoelting et al (Case No. 17-cv-00893) (the \u201cFederal Derivative Action\u201d). On March 28, 2018, plaintiffs filed their Verified Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint alleging claims on our behalf against Peter Armbruster, Mark DiBlasi, Scott Dobak, Christopher Doerr, Ivor Evans, Brian van Helden, John Kennedy III, Ralph Kittle, Brian Murray, Scott Rued, James Staley, Curtis Stoelting, William Urkiel, Chad Utrup, Judith Vijums, and Michael Ward. Count I alleges that several of the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 based upon alleged misrepresentations and omissions in several of our proxy statements. Count II alleges that all the defendants breached their fiduciary duty. Count III alleges that all the defendants wasted corporate assets. Count IV alleges that certain of the defendants were unjustly enriched. The Complaint seeks monetary damages, improvements to our corporate governance and internal procedures, an accounting from defendants of the damages allegedly caused by them and the improper amounts the defendants allegedly obtained, and punitive damages. The parties are currently finalizing the terms of a Stipulation of Settlement, which provides for certain corporate governance changes and a $6.9 million payment, $4.8 million of which will be paid by our D&O carriers into an escrow account to be used by us to settle the class action described above and $2.1 million of which will be paid by our D&O carriers to cover plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, subject to court approval.\nGiven the status of the matters above, we concluded in 2018 that a liability is probable and recorded the estimated loss of $22 million and a corresponding insurance reimbursement receivable of $20 million.\nIn addition, subsequent to our announcement that certain previously filed financial statements should not be relied upon, we were contacted by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d). The DOJ and Division of Enforcement of the SEC have commenced investigations into the events giving rise to the restatement. We have received formal requests for documents and other information. In addition, in June 2018 two of our former employees were indicted on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud as part of the ongoing DOJ and SEC investigation. We are cooperating fully with the joint DOJ and SEC investigation. Given the status of this matter, we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential costs or range of costs at this time.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of these matters, or whether any other actions or proceedings will be filed against us in the future, and the cost of defending such actions or proceedings could be material. Furthermore, defending such actions or proceedings could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. If we are found liable in any actions or proceedings, we may have to pay substantial damages or change the way we conduct our business, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. There may also be negative publicity associated with litigation or regulatory proceedings that could harm our business and reputation and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements was time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAs described in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015, Amendment No. 1 to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, and Note 15 \u201cRestatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, and each of the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, as well as the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The restatement was time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to a number of additional risks that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn particular, we have incurred significant expense, including audit, legal, consulting, and other professional fees, as well as fees related to amendments to our prior senior credit facilities, the 2017 Investment Agreement (defined below), the Series E-1 Investment Agreement (defined below) and the Prior ABL Facility (defined below), in connection with the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps, including both adding internal personnel and hiring outside consultants, and intend to continue to take appropriate and reasonable steps to strengthen our accounting function and reduce the risk of additional misstatements in our financial statements. For more details about our remediation plan, see Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K. To the extent these steps are not successful, we may have to incur additional time and expense. Our management\u2019s attention has also been, and may further be, diverted from the operation of our business in connection with the restatement and ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe are also subject to claims, investigations, and proceedings arising out of the errors in our previously issued financial statements, including securities class action litigation, derivative lawsuits, and government agency investigations.\nOne or more significant claims or the cost of maintaining our insurance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe employ approximately 1,400 drivers and use the services of thousands of ICs and transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations. We also provide air freight services with our fleet of 12 cargo jets. From time to time, these drivers or pilots are, or may be, involved in accidents which may cause injuries and in which goods carried by them are lost or damaged. Such accidents usually result in equipment damage and, unfortunately, can also result in injuries or death. Although most of these drivers are ICs or work for third-party carriers, from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them. Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, or may not be covered by insurance at all. Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including, but not limited to, hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event of an accident resulting in injuries or contamination. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may under any of these circumstances be excluded by or exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or the insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, claims for lost or damaged goods, liability claims, workers' compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of any such claims could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent claims are not covered by our insurance or such losses exceed our reserves. Significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could also reduce our profitability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could also significantly and adversely impact our operating results compared to prior periods.\nIncreased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nInsurance carriers may increase premiums for transportation companies generally. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in the future if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain sufficient or desired levels of insurance at reasonable rates. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nThe cost of compliance with, liability for violations of, or modifications to existing or future governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various federal and state agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. These regulatory agencies have authority and oversight of domestic and international transportation services and related activities, licensure, motor carrier operations, safety and security, and other matters. We must comply with various insurance and surety bond requirements to act in the capacities for which we are licensed. Our subsidiaries and ICs must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of such agencies.\nThrough our subsidiaries, we hold various licenses required to carry out our domestic and international services. These licenses permit us to provide services as a motor carrier, property broker, air carrier, indirect air carrier, ocean transportation intermediary, non-vessel operating common carrier, freight forwarder, and ocean freight forwarder. We also are subject to regulations and requirements promulgated by, among others, the DOT, FMCSA, DHS, CBP, TSA, FMC, IATA, USDA, FDA, FWS, BATF, FAA and various other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. Our failure to maintain our required licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See the section entitled \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nIn addition, DHS regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the United States and our contracted ocean carriers may impact our ability to provide and/or receive services with and from these parties. Enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and/or prevent the delivery of shipments, which may negatively impact our operations.\nWe incur significant costs to operate our business and monitor our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The regulatory requirements governing our operations are subject to change based on new legislation and regulatory initiatives, which could affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services. We cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business. Compliance with existing, new, or more stringent measures could disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries and our ability to satisfy the needs of our customers. We have adopted various policies and procedures intended to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements. We cannot provide assurance that these policies and procedures will be adequate or effective. Additionally, we are also subject to the risk that our employees may inadvertently or deliberately circumvent established controls. The financial and reputational impact of control failures could be significant.\nIn addition, we may experience an increase in operating costs, such as security costs, as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities. The cost of compliance with existing or future measures could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we could become subject to liabilities as a result of a failure to comply with applicable regulations.\nWe are subject to various income and other taxes, primarily in the U.S. and its political subdivisions. Compliance with ever-changing tax statutes and regulations is complex, time-consuming, and subject to examination by taxing authorities. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into United States law, and most changes became effective as of January 1, 2018. Overall, we expect that the Tax Reform Act will be financially and cash flow beneficial to us. The corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%, the corporate alternative minimum tax system was eliminated, and net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. The ability to accelerate depreciation deductions provides us flexibility with respect to the timing of deductions related to capital expenditures. Though interest expense deductions may be limited annually, any disallowed interest expense carries forward indefinitely. Future changes to current tax laws could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nJeffrey Cox and David Chidester filed a complaint against certain of our subsidiaries in state court in California in a post-acquisition dispute (the \u201cCentral Cal Matter\u201d). The complaint alleges contract, statutory and tort-based claims arising out of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 2, 2012, between the defendants, as buyers, and the plaintiffs, as sellers, for the purchase of the shares of Central Cal Transportation, Inc. and Double C Transportation, Inc. (the \u201cCentral Cal Agreement\u201d). The plaintiffs claim that a contingent purchase obligation payment is due and owing pursuant to the Central Cal Agreement, and that defendants have furnished fraudulent calculations to the plaintiffs to avoid payment. The plaintiffs also claim violations of California\u2019s Labor Code related to the plaintiffs\u2019 respective employment with Central Cal Transportation, LLC. On October 27, 2017, the state court granted our motion to compel arbitration of all non-employment claims alleged in the complaint. The parties selected a settlement accountant to determine the contingent purchase obligation pursuant to the Central Cal Agreement. The settlement accountant provided a final determination that a contingent purchase obligation of $2.1 million is due to the plaintiffs. It is our position that this contingent purchase obligation is subject to offset for certain indemnification claims owed to us by the plaintiffs ranging from approximately $0.3 million to $1.0 million. Accordingly, we have recorded a contingent purchase obligation liability of $1.8 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We intend to pursue indemnification and other claims as it relates to the Central Cal Matter and other related matters involving these plaintiffs. In February 2018, Plaintiff David Chidester agreed to dismiss his employment-related claims from the Los Angeles Superior Court matter, while Plaintiff Jeffrey Cox transferred his employment claims from Los Angeles Superior Court to the related employment case pending in the Eastern District of California. The parties are proceeding with discovery and the consolidated case is currently set for trial on November 5, 2019.\nIn addition to the legal proceeding described above, we are a defendant in various purported class-action lawsuits alleging violations of various California labor laws and one purported class-action lawsuit alleging violations of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act. Additionally, the California Division of Labor Standards and Enforcement has brought administrative actions against us alleging that we violated various California labor laws. In 2017 and 2018, we reached settlement agreements on a number of these labor related lawsuits and administrative actions. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a liability for settlements, litigation, and defense costs related to these labor matters, the Central Cal Matter and the Warren Matter (defined below) of approximately $10.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively, which are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIn December 2018, a class action lawsuit was brought against us in the Superior Court of the State of California by Fernando Gomez, on behalf of himself and other similarly situated persons, alleging violation of California labor laws. This is a new lawsuit and we are currently determining its effects. We intend to vigorously defend against such claims; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail. In light of the relatively early stage of the proceedings, we are unable to predict the potential costs or range of costs at this time.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nFrom time to time, we arrange for the movement of hazardous materials at the request of our customers. As a result, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the handling, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials. If our customers or carriers are involved in an accident involving hazardous materials, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties, remediation costs, or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, current and future laws and regulations relating to carbon emissions and the effects of global warming can be expected to have a significant impact on the transportation sector generally and the operations and profitability of some of our carriers in particular, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA decrease in levels of capacity in the over-the-road freight sector could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe current operating environment in the over-the-road freight sector resulting from fluctuating fuel costs, industry-specific regulations (such as the CSA and hours-of-service rules and the changes implemented under Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (\u201cMAP-21\u201d)), a shortage of qualified drivers, and other economic factors are causing a tightening of capacity in the sector generally, and in our carrier network specifically, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our business strategy and on our business.\nWe have not successfully managed, and may not in the future manage, our growth or operations.\nWe have grown substantially, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions, and entering into new markets. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets, change in revenue and business models, and entering into new geographic areas. For example, as described in Part II, Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, based on the Audit Committee Investigation, current management determined that there were deficiencies in the design and/or execution of internal controls that constituted material weaknesses, with one of the contributing factors being the increased size and complexity of our Company arising from the acquisition of 25 non-public companies between February 2011 and September 2015.\nIn 2018, we devised strategies to improve our operational performance, integrate and expand certain of our segments, invest in the long-term recovery of our business and position our business for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. We have, and may in the future, experience delay in the implementation and realization of these strategies. The success of our strategies depends on many factors, some of which are out of our control. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies or that these strategies will be successful.\nOur growth has placed, and will in the future place, a significant strain on our management and our operational and financial resources. We need to continually improve existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to expand, train, and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs have increased substantially as our operations have grown. Failure to manage growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, has in the past had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur outstanding debt and preferred stock could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our business or respond to changes, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service and preferred stock obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had debt of $171.9 million and preferred stock of $402.9 million, which is classified as a liability on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 \u201cDebt\u201d and Note 6 \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information. On May 1, 2017, we entered into an Investment Agreement (the \u201c2017 Investment Agreement\u201d) with Elliott, pursuant to which we issued and sold shares of our preferred stock and issued warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $540.5 million. On March 1, 2018, we entered into a Series E-1 Preferred Stock Investment Agreement (as amended, the \u201cSeries E-1 Investment Agreement\u201d) with Elliott, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to Elliott from time to time until July 30, 2018, an aggregate of up to 54,750 shares of a newly created class of preferred stock designated as Series E-1 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cSeries E-1 Preferred Stock\u201d), at a purchase price of $1,000 per share for the first 17,500 shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock, $960 per share for the next 18,228 shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock, and $920 per share for the final 19,022 shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock. On March 1, 2018, the parties held an initial closing pursuant to which we issued and sold to Elliott 17,500 shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $17.5 million. On April 24, 2018, the parties held a closing pursuant to the Series E-1 Investment Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold to Elliott 18,228 shares of Series E-1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17.5 million. On February 26, 2019, we closed our previously announced fully backstopped $450 million rights offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 900 million new shares of our common stock at the subscription price of $0.50 per share. The net proceeds from the rights offering and backstop commitment were used to fully redeem the outstanding shares of our preferred stock and to pay related accrued and unpaid dividends. Proceeds were also used to pay fees and expenses in connection with the rights offering and backstop commitment. We retained in excess of $30 million of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 21, 2017, we entered into an Asset-Based Lending Facility with BMO Harris Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (as amended, the \u201cPrior ABL Facility\u201d). On February 28, 2019, we entered into the ABL Credit Facility and the Term Loan Credit Facility, which replaced the Prior ABL Facility.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including any additional borrowings available under the ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan Credit Facility. Any substantial debt and the fact that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities could be needed to make payments on our debt could have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, which would place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to borrow any funds needed to operate and expand our business will depend in part on our ability to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash is subject to the performance of our business as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us under our ABL Credit Facility and/or Term Loan Credit Facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, financial condition, and ability to maintain or expand our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, our inability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations in the future would require us to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures, or seek additional equity.\nWe have had, and may have in the future, difficulties integrating acquired companies.\nFor acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. We are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. For example, as described in Part II, Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, based on the Audit Committee Investigation, current management determined that there were deficiencies in the design and/or execution of internal controls that constituted material weaknesses, with one of the contributing factors being the increased size and complexity of our Company arising from the acquisition of 25 non-public companies between February 2011 and September 2015. The possible difficulties of integration include, among others: retention of customers and key employees; unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications, technology, and other systems; inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them; consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns; the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities. The diversion of management's attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations has prevented us, and could in the future prevent us, from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions and has adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlso, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. In addition, the former owners of the businesses we acquire may seek additional consideration under contingent purchase obligations resulting in increased purchase prices. See \u201c-The cost of compliance with, liability for violations of, or modifications to existing or future governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\u201d If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may seek to increase our revenue and expand our offerings in the market regions that we serve through the acquisition of complementary businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. Even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments. The issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nStrategic acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates;\n\u2022\nproblems integrating the purchased operations with our own, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems;\n\u2022\npotential compliance issues with regard to acquired companies that did not have adequate internal controls;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company.\nOur ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement contain financial and other restrictive covenants with which we may be unable to comply. A default under these financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries pursuant to a guaranty included in the ABL Credit Agreement. As security for our and our subsidiaries\u2019 obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement, we and each of our domestic subsidiaries have granted: (i) a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 tangible and intangible personal property (other than the assets described in the following clause (ii)), including the capital stock of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries; and (ii) a second-priority lien on our and our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 equipment (including, without limitation, rolling stock, aircraft, aircraft engines and aircraft parts) and proceeds and accounts related thereto. The priority of the liens is described in an intercreditor agreement between BMO Harris Bank N.A. as ABL Agent and BMO Harris Bank N.A. as Term Loan Agent. The ABL Credit Agreement contains a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant that must be maintained when excess availability falls below a specified amount. In addition, the ABL Credit Agreement contains negative covenants limiting, among other things, additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, additional liens, sales of assets, dividends, investments and advances, prepayments of debt, mergers and acquisitions, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, events of bankruptcy and insolvency, failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the ABL Credit Agreement to be in full force and effect, and a change of control of our business.\nThe obligations under our Term Loan Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries pursuant to a guaranty included in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As security for our and our subsidiaries\u2019 obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we and each of our domestic subsidiaries have granted: (i) a first priority lien on our equipment (including, without limitation, rolling stock, aircraft, aircraft engines and aircraft parts) and proceeds and accounts related thereto, and (ii) a second priority lien on substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 other tangible and intangible personal property, including the capital stock of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The priority of the liens is described in an intercreditor agreement between BMO Harris Bank N.A. as ABL Agent and BMO Harris Bank N.A. as Term Loan Agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains negative covenants limiting, among other things, additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, additional liens, sales of assets, dividends, investments and advances, prepayments of debt, mergers and acquisitions, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The Term Loan Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, events of bankruptcy and insolvency, failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the Term Loan Credit Agreement to be in full force and effect, and a change of control of our business.\nIf we incur defaults under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement or the Term Loan Credit Agreement and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings against these facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. If we fail to pay the amount due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which our loans are secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if the facilities are terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under our ABL Credit Facility and/or Term Loan Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel and limitations on our ability to collect fuel surcharges may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with fuel charges from our ICs, purchased power providers, and aircraft in our TES and LTL businesses. The availability and price of fuel are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are outside of our control. Fuel prices have fluctuated dramatically over recent years. Over time we have been able to mitigate the impact of the fluctuations through our fuel surcharges which are closely linked to the market price for fuel. There can be no assurance that our fuel surcharge revenue programs will be effective in the future. Market pressures may limit our ability to assess our fuel surcharges. At the request of our customers, we have at times temporarily capped the fuel surcharges at a fixed percentage pursuant to contractual arrangements that vary by customer. Currently, a minimal number of our customers have contractual arrangements with varying levels of capped fuel surcharges. If fuel surcharge revenue programs, base freight rate increases, or other cost-recovery mechanisms do not offset our exposure to rising fuel costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA significant or prolonged economic downturn in the transportation industry, or a substantial downturn in our customers' business, could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe transportation industry has historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to, among other things, economic recession, downturns in business cycles, increasing costs and taxes, fluctuations in energy prices, price increases by carriers, changes in regulatory standards, license and registration fees, interest rate fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond\nour control. All of these factors could increase the operating costs of a vehicle and impact capacity levels in the transportation industry. Our ICs or purchased power providers may charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses, and our operating income may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher purchased transportation costs. Additionally, economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, their need for our services, or their ability to pay for our services.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs, our business could suffer.\nCompetition in the transportation services industry is intense. We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and international markets. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability, including the following:\n\u2022\ncompetition with other transportation services companies, some of which have a broader coverage network, a wider range of services, and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022\nreduction by our competitors of their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of declining growth rates in the economy, which reductions may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our operating margins, or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by shippers of bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and the resulting depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of a technology system similar to ours by a competitor with sufficient financial resources and comparable experience in the transportation services industry; and\n\u2022\nestablishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs.\nWe have experienced significant turnover in our executive leadership team. If we fail to effectively integrate and retain these new executives, we may not be able to accomplish our growth strategy and our financial performance may suffer.\nSince the beginning of 2017, we have experienced significant turnover in our senior management ranks, including the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer and the hiring of our new Chief Financial Officer. In April 2017, Curtis W. Stoelting was appointed our Chief Executive Officer and Michael L. Gettle was appointed our President and Chief Operating Officer. In May 2017, Terence R. Rogers was appointed our Chief Financial Officer. We also hired a new Corporate Controller, Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, and Director of Internal Audit. In addition, during 2018, our Chief Information Officer resigned and we hired a new Chief Information Officer. This lack of management continuity could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy, as well as result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult.\nIn addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel into our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may affect our financial performance and results of operations while new management becomes familiar with our business. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend to a significant extent on our ability to motivate and retain key management personnel. Competition for senior management is intense, and we may not be able to retain our management team or attract additional qualified personnel. The loss of a member of senior management would require our remaining executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to fulfilling the duties of the departing executive and to seeking a replacement. The inability to adequately fill vacancies in our senior executive positions on a timely basis could negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur business will be adversely impacted if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect, and integrate our information technology systems.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems to efficiently run our business, and they are a key component of our customer-facing and internal growth strategy. In general, we expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their transportation and logistics providers. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our technology systems in response to these trends. This process of continuous enhancement may lead to significant ongoing technology development costs which will continue to increase if we pursue new acquisitions of companies and their current systems. In addition, we may fail to accurately determine the needs of our customers or trends in the transportation services and logistics industries or we may fail to design and implement the appropriate responsive features and functionality for our technology systems in a timely\nand cost-effective manner. Any such failures could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues.\nWe must maintain and enhance the reliability and speed of our information technology systems to remain competitive and effectively handle higher volumes of freight through our network and the various service modes we offer. If our information technology systems are unable to manage additional volume for our operations as our business grows, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various service modes we offer, our service levels and operating efficiency could decline. In addition, if we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect, and maintain our information technology systems or if we fail to upgrade our systems to meet our customers\u2019 demands, our business and results of operations could be harmed. This could result in a loss of customers or a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure or a breach of our information security systems, networks or processes may materially adversely affect our business.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our sales and marketing, accounting and financial and legal and compliance functions, communications, supply chain, order entry, and fulfillment and other business processes. We also rely on third parties and virtualized infrastructure to operate and support our information technology systems. Despite testing, external and internal risks, such as malware, code anomalies, \u201cActs of God,\u201d data leakage, and human error pose a direct threat to the stability or effectiveness of our information technology systems and operations. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our business through transaction errors, billing and invoicing errors, internal recordkeeping and reporting errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, receivables collection and customers, in each case, which could result in harm to our reputation and have an ongoing adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including after the underlying failures have been remedied.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyber-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to our customers or others, the diversion of corporate resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. On May 30, 2018, we became aware of unauthorized access into our information technology systems, and on July 2, 2018, we became aware of additional unauthorized access, each as a result of a phishing campaign attack upon our employees. After an investigation conducted by third party forensic investigators, we discovered a significant breach and loss of information regarding a substantial portion of our ICs and employees, including, but not limited to, their names, addresses, Social Security numbers, financial account information, medical information, insurance information, and other types of identifying or sensitive information. On November 7, 2018, we were sued in a class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in connection with the foregoing cybersecurity attacks, alleging we failed to adequately safeguard and secure the identifying information of our employees and failed to provide timely notice as to how and when sensitive information regarding our employees had been given to unknown persons. We have referred this claim to our cybersecurity insurance provider and have obtained counsel to defend us in this suit. While we do not expect our exposure under this matter to be material, we cannot guarantee that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn other occasions, we have experienced other phishing attacks, social engineering and wire fraud affecting our employees and suppliers, which has resulted in leakage of personally identifiable information and loss of funds. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. In addition, recently, there has also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the United States and abroad, and failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, employee training, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions or data loss, which could adversely impact our competitiveness and results of operations.\nOur reliance on ICs to provide transportation services to our customers could impact our operations and ability to expand.\nOur transportation services are conducted in part by ICs, who are generally responsible for paying for their own equipment, fuel, and other operating costs. Our ICs are responsible for providing the tractors and generally the trailers they use related to our business. Certain factors such as increases in fuel costs, insurance costs and the cost of new and used tractors, reduced financing sources available to ICs for the purchase of equipment, or the impact of CSA and hours-of-service rules could create a difficult operating environment for ICs. Turnover and bankruptcy among ICs in the over-the-road freight sector often limit the pool of\nqualified ICs and increase the competition among carriers for their services. If we are required to increase the amounts paid to ICs in order to obtain their services, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent increased expenses are not offset by higher freight rates. Additionally, our agreements with our ICs are terminable by either party upon short notice and without penalty. Consequently, we regularly need to recruit qualified ICs to replace those who have left our pool. If we are unable to retain our existing ICs or recruit new ICs, our results of operations and ability to expand our business could be adversely affected.\nOur third-party carriers must meet our needs and expectations, and those of our customers, and their inability to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business depends to a large extent on our ability to provide consistent, high quality, technology-enabled transportation and logistics solutions. We generally do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers' freight, and we generally do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight. We rely on third parties to provide less-than-truckload, truckload and intermodal brokerage, and domestic and international air services and to report certain information to us, including information relating to delivery status and freight claims. This reliance could cause delays in providing our customers with timely delivery of freight and important service data, as well as in the financial reporting of certain events, including recognizing revenue and recording claims. Carrier bankruptcy may also disrupt our business by delaying movement of the cargo, creating an inability to get access to equipment, and increasing our rates. If we are unable to secure sufficient transportation services to meet our customer commitments, or if any of the third parties we rely on do not meet our needs or expectations, or those of our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently.\nIf our ICs are deemed to be employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are a defendant in various purported class-action lawsuits alleging violations of various labor laws. We are a defendant in a number of purported class-action lawsuits alleging violations of various California labor laws and one purported class-action lawsuit alleging violations of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act. Additionally, the California Division of Labor Standards and Enforcement has brought administrative actions against us alleging that we violated various California labor laws. In 2017 and 2018, we reached settlement agreements on a number of these labor related lawsuits and administrative actions. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a liability for settlements, litigation, and defense costs related to these labor matters, the Central Cal Matter, and the Warren Matter (defined below) of approximately $10.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively, which are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIn addition, tax and other regulatory authorities have in the past sought to assert that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. There can be no assurance that these authorities will not successfully assert this position against us or that tax and other laws that currently consider these persons ICs will not change. If our ICs are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits, tax withholdings, and penalties and interest. Our business model relies on the fact that our ICs are independent contractors and not deemed to be our employees, and exposure to any of the above factors could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCalifornia continues to present potential reclassification exposure to our Company\u2019s operations in that state, especially in light of the recent California Supreme Court decision in Dynamix Operations West, Inc. v. Lee, which found that the defendant\u2019s independent contractors were properly classified as employees using the ABC test. Under the ABC test, a worker is presumed to be an employee unless the business proves that (A) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hirer in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of such work and in fact; (B) the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business; and (C) the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring entity. However, as noted by the Court in Dynamix, any reclassification analysis under the ABC test is subject to the unique facts of each case and thus does not necessarily mean that our contractors in California would be reclassified as employees under California law.\nIf California interprets individual owner-operators to be in the same business as motor carriers, the individual owner-operators under lease to our companies would be considered employees for purposes of claims governed by wage order number 9, including minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest breaks, and wage statements. We have approximately 300 non-employee drivers in California that may be impacted by this interpretation.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices.\nFuture changes in accounting standards or practices, and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes, may adversely impact public companies in general, the transportation industry, or our operations specifically. New accounting standards or requirements could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets, and/or liabilities or could be costly to implement. These types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations, and/or access to capital.\nSeasonal sales fluctuations and weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe transportation industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations as shipments are generally lower during and after the winter holiday season. The productivity of our carriers historically decreases during the winter season because companies have the tendency to reduce their shipments during that time and inclement weather can impede operations. At the same time, our operating expenses could increase because harsh weather can lead to increased accident frequency rates and increased claims, as well as reduced commodity production (i.e. poultry, beef, fruit, produce). These commodities and other products we transport are also subject to disease, crop failure, reduction in production quantities or adjustments to automotive model changeovers. Any of the fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenues. If we were to experience lower-than-expected revenue during any such period, our expenses may not be offset, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, anti-terrorism measures, and war could have broad detrimental effects on our business operations.\nAs a result of the potential for terrorist attacks, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to follow various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Such measures may reduce the productivity of our ICs or increase the costs associated with their operations, which we could be forced to bear. For example, security measures imposed at bridges, tunnels, border crossings, and other points on key trucking routes may cause delays and increase the non-driving time of our ICs, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. War, risk of war, or a terrorist attack also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war also could impact our ability to raise capital. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nOur Ascent business derives a portion of its revenues from inventory management, the loss of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA portion of our Ascent business is involved with inventory and freight management for customers whose products are shipped to a limited number of big box retailers. Should these big box retailers change their supply chain practices and direct our customers to deliver product via another source, such change could have a negative impact on our Ascent business.\nOur international operations subject us to operational and financial risks.\nWe provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, and taxations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\ndifferent liability standards; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including, but not limited to, our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nWe are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), any sanctions administered or enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and applicable money laundering statutes, rules, and regulations. Failure to comply with the FCPA, OFAC sanctions, money laundering statutes, and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in legal claims against us.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region.\nAs we expand our business in foreign countries, we will be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have limited control over these risks, and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, due to general economic conditions, our capital structure, any operations\ndifficulties which we may face, and other factors, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional equity financing may dilute the interests of our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures. Our ability to raise capital in the future may also be limited if our common stock were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). See \u201c- The NYSE could commence procedures to delist our common stock, in which case the market price of our shares might decline and become more volatile and our stockholders\u2019 ability to trade in our stock could be adversely affected.\"\nOur total assets include goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had recorded goodwill of $264.8 million and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $42.5 million. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. If the impairment evaluations for goodwill indicate the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill are performed at least annually as of July 1 and periodically if indicators of impairment are present.\nWe changed our segment reporting effective January 1, 2018 when we integrated our truckload brokerage business into the Ascent domestic freight management business. In connection with the change in segments, we conducted an impairment analysis as of January 1, 2018 and determined there was no impairment. We conducted our annual goodwill impairment analysis for each of our four reporting units as of July 1, 2018 and determined that the fair values of the TES, Domestic and International Logistics, and Warehousing & Consolidation reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 5.1%, 12.8%, and 112.2%, respectively; thus no impairment was indicated for these reporting units. The LTL reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as of July 1, 2018.\nThe sale of our wholly owned subsidiary Unitrans, Inc. (\u201cUnitrans\u201d), which was included in the Ascent reporting unit, resulted in an incremental impairment analysis on the remaining net assets of the Ascent reporting unit. We evaluated the remaining carrying value of the Ascent reporting unit and compared it to the fair value of the remaining businesses in the Ascent reporting unit. As a result of this evaluation, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recorded a $4.4 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2017.\nAs a result of the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis as of July 1, 2016, we determined that the fair value of the Domestic and International Logistics reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 8.4%; thus, no impairment was indicated for this reporting unit. However, resulting from a combination of the weakened environment, the inability to meet forecast results, and the lower share price, we determined that the fair value of the TES, LTL, and Warehousing & Consolidation reporting units were less than their respective carrying values, requiring us to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis for our TES, LTL, and Warehousing & Consolidation reporting units. We completed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis for our TES, LTL, and Warehousing & Consolidation reporting units and recorded in the third quarter of 2016 non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $132.4 million, $197.3 million, and $42.4 million for our TES, LTL, and Warehousing & Consolidation reporting units, respectively.\nIn addition, throughout the year we may update our assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit. Changes to our forecasts or the discount rate and/or growth rate assumptions based on current market conditions could affect the fair value of the reporting units and result in an indication of impairment for one or more of our reporting units. If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets in any reporting units have become impaired in the future, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to expand the number of our sales representatives, or if a significant number of our existing sales representatives leave us, our ability to increase our revenue could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to expand our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional sales representatives and brokerage agents. Competition for qualified sales representatives can be intense, and we may be unable to attract such persons. Any difficulties we experience in expanding the number of our sales representatives could have a negative impact on our ability to expand our customer base, increase our revenue, and continue our growth.\nIn addition, we must retain our current sales representatives and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers and maintain existing customer relationships. If a significant number of our sales representatives leave us, our revenue could be negatively impacted. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our current sales representatives could also increase our recruiting costs and decrease our operating efficiency.\nChanges in our relationships with our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe had one direct customer that accounted for approximately 12% of our 2018 revenue. Our contractual relationships with customers generally are terminable at will by the customers on short notice and do not require the customer to provide any minimum commitment. Our customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand rate reductions for our services, require us to assume greater liability that increases our costs, or develop their own logistics capabilities. Failure to retain our existing customers or enter into relationships with new customers could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long-term financial forecasts.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations in our filings with the SEC compared to other issuers, including with respect to disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Until such time as we cease to be a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d such reduced disclosure in our filings with the SEC may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects.\nIf some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure we may make, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe price of our common stock on the NYSE constantly changes and has recently experienced a general decline. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate or may decline further. Our share price may fluctuate or decline as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in earnings, financial or operating performance, or liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts' recommendations or projections;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts' projections;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\noperating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;\n\u2022\nactions by government regulators;\n\u2022\nnews reports of trends, concerns, and other issues related to us or our industry, including changes in regulations; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAdditionally, on December 27, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 for the offer and sale of up to 7,810,625 shares of our common stock by investment funds affiliated with HCI Equity Partners (\u201cHCI\u201d). The sale of our common stock by HCI could impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock price may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future, and these changes may be unrelated to our performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.\nThe NYSE could commence procedures to delist our common stock, in which case the market price of our shares might decline and become more volatile and our stockholders\u2019 ability to trade in our stock could be adversely affected.\nThe continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE is subject to our compliance with a number of quantitative listing standards, including market capitalization criteria and price per share criteria. On October 4, 2018, we received notice from the NYSE that we were not in compliance with respect to the applicable listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (\u201cSection 802.01B\u201d), because our average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $50,000,000, and at the same time stockholders\u2019 investment was less than $50,000,000. We timely notified the NYSE that we would submit a plan within 45 calendar days from receipt of the notice, advising the NYSE of definitive action we are taking that will bring us into compliance with Section 802.01B within 18 months from receipt of the notice. We timely submitted our plan which was subsequently accepted by the NYSE. There can be no guarantee that we will regain compliance\nwithin the 18-month cure period. If we are unable to regain compliance within the 18-month cure period, we will be subject to suspension and delisting procedures.\nOn October 12, 2018, we receive an additional notice from the NYSE that we were not in compliance with respect to the listing standard set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (\u201cSection 802.01C\u201d) because the average closing price of our common stock over the previous 30 consecutive trading-day period had fallen below $1.00 per share. We timely notified the NYSE that we intended to cure the deficiency and regain compliance with Section 802.01C within the 6-month cure period. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to regain compliance within the 6-month cure period. If we do not regain compliance with Section 802.01C, we will be subject to suspension and delisting procedures.\nIn addition to the above continued listing standards, if our average global market capitalization over any consecutive 30 trading-day period is less than $15 million, the NYSE may promptly initiate procedures to suspend and delist our common stock from trading on the NYSE. As of March 5, 2019, our global market capitalization was approximately $432 million.\nIf our common stock were delisted, there could be no assurance whether or when it would again be listed for trading on NYSE or any other exchange. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things: reducing the liquidity and market price and increasing the volatility of our common stock, which may adversely affect the ability of stockholders to trade in our common stock; reducing the number of investors, including institutional investors, willing to hold or acquire our common stock, including institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies, which might sell our shares, perhaps very promptly, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing and have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; limiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions; impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees; and impacting our reputation and, as a consequence, our ability to attract new business.\nFollowing the closing of our rights offering, Elliott beneficially owns approximately 90.4% of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders have become minority stockholders in a company controlled by Elliott. There may be very limited liquidity for our common stock, and there may be more limited opportunities for our stockholders to realize a control premium.\nOn February 26, 2019, we closed our previously announced fully backstopped $450 million rights offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 900 million new shares of our common stock at the subscription price of $0.50 per share. Elliott purchased a total of 843,632,693 shares of our common stock in the rights offering between its basic subscription rights and the backstop commitment, and following the closing of the rights offering beneficially owned approximately 90.4% of our common stock. As a result, Elliott is able to exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure, the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our winding up and dissolution. In addition, our stockholders approved certain corporate governance proposals at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 19, 2018. The corporate governance changes resulting from such approvals are beneficial to Elliott as such changes allow any controlling stockholder to exercise greater control over our Company than it otherwise would have. The interests of our stockholders may differ from the interests of Elliott.\nElliott is not subject to any lock-up with respect to its shares of our common stock. Elliott therefore has the ability to sell its controlling position in a privately negotiated transaction and realize a control premium for the shares of our common stock held by it if it is able to find a buyer that is willing to pay such a premium. Our stockholders should not assume that in connection with such a sale of control by Elliott there would be a concurrent offer for the shares held by other stockholders or that our stockholders would otherwise be able to realize any control premium for their shares. Additionally, if Elliott privately sells a significant equity interest in us, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with the interests of other stockholders.\nIn addition, we expect that a significant portion of the shares of our common stock held by Elliott may be pledged as part of the collateral securing certain of Elliott\u2019s secured borrowing arrangements. Upon certain events of default, the secured lenders under these arrangements may take possession, hold, collect, sell, lease, deliver, grant options to purchase or otherwise retain, liquidate or dispose of all or any portion of the collateral. Any such enforcement action by Elliott\u2019s secured lenders may result in a change in control of our Company. In addition, upon such events of default, the registration rights we granted to Elliott will immediately and automatically be assigned in full to the secured lenders with respect to any registrable securities held by such secured lenders. We have no obligation to maintain Elliott\u2019s financial viability and Elliott may not remain current on its obligations under its secured borrowing arrangements.\nSince Elliott now owns a significant majority of our outstanding common stock following the closing of the rights offering, the liquidity for our common stock may be adversely affected. Elliott is not required to cause the Company to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. If we were to decide to discontinue the listing of our common stock, this may further adversely affect the liquidity in our common stock. Any such reduced liquidity is likely to materially and adversely affect the trading price\nfor our common stock. Other actions that we may take now that we are controlled by Elliott could have additional material and adverse effects on the liquidity in our common stock and our stock price.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards. Consequently, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance rules and requirements.\nFollowing the closing of our rights offering, Elliott beneficially owned approximately 90.4% of our common stock. As a result, we are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards. Under the NYSE listing standards, a controlled company may elect to not comply with certain NYSE corporate governance standards, including the requirements that (i) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) it maintain a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter address addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, (iii) it have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, and (iv) it have an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. Although Elliott has indicated that we will not utilize these exemptions and others afforded to controlled companies, Elliott could change its intention and take advantage of the controlled company standards. Consequently, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance rules and requirements. In addition, our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nSince Elliott owns greater than 35% of our common stock after the closing of the rights offering, the acquisition of shares by Elliott in the rights offering was deemed a change in control under certain management compensation plans and agreements, which could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the ownership by Elliott of a substantial percentage of our common stock after the closing of the rights offering may be deemed a change in control under certain of our other arrangements and agreements with customers, suppliers, or other parties, which could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFollowing the closing of our rights offering, Elliott beneficially owned approximately 90.4% of our common stock, which was deemed a change in control under certain management compensation plans and agreements. A change in control under certain of our management compensation plans and agreements requires the accelerated vesting of all outstanding and unvested equity awards. In addition, upon such change in control, certain members of management are now entitled to cash-based severance payments, health and welfare benefits, and bonus payments if such members of senior management are terminated without cause or for good reason (each as defined in their respective employment agreements) within twenty-four months following the change in control. Such cash payments and benefits would be difficult for us to make given our current liquidity constraints and would further constrain our liquidity. While we have obtained waivers to these provisions from members of our senior management and directors, we have not obtained waivers from other employees and plan participants. If we are required to make any payments due to a change in control, such payments and provision of benefits could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, the ownership by Elliott of a substantial percentage of our common stock after the closing of the rights offering may be deemed a change in control under certain of our other arrangements and agreements with customers, suppliers, or other parties, which could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. We are continuing to analyze the effects, if any, such a change in control may have on any such arrangements or agreements.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, discourage a takeover, and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may make it more difficult or delay attempts by others to obtain control of our Company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. These include provisions limiting the stockholders' powers to remove directors or take action by written consent instead of at a stockholders' meeting. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock. On May 2, 2017, we issued shares of our preferred stock to affiliates of Elliott pursuant to the 2017 Investment Agreement. On March 1 and April 24, 2018 we issued additional shares of our preferred stock to affiliates of Elliott pursuant to the Series E-1 Investment Agreement. See Note 6 \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides for our board to be divided into three classes, serving staggered terms. The classified board provision could have the effect of discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. Delaware law also imposes conditions on the voting of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d and on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d\nThese provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. Further, our stockholders approved the Corporate Governance Proposals at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 19, 2018. Such provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, discourage a takeover, and could adversely affect existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 93384, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "RRTS"}
