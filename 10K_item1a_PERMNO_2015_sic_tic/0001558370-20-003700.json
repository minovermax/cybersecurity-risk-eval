RISK FACTORS\nThere are many risks and uncertainties that could, and likely will, adversely affect our business. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described below and elsewhere in this report, particularly found in \u201cForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements.\u201d The following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties, as it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Unknown or unidentified additional risks and uncertainties could also adversely affect our business. In addition, the risks described below are not listed in order of the likelihood that the risk might occur or the severity of the impact if the risk should occur.\nOur business will be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nOverview\nThe U.S. and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, our operations in a number of ways, including supply chain disruptions, reduced traffic to our stores, cancellations of large gatherings such as proms and weddings, temporary store closures and disruptions to our employees working at our stores, distribution centers and offices. More generally, our business depends on consumer discretionary spending, and as such, our results are particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence. COVID-19 has significantly impacted economic conditions. For example, during March 2020, the U.S. economy experienced an unprecedented increase in the number of people seeking jobless benefits and global financial markets experienced significant declines. These and other effects make it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our business, particularly over the near-to-medium term. While we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, we do expect such impact to be significantly negative.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among others, the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions, especially those taken by governmental authorities, to contain the pandemic or treat its impact. As events are rapidly changing, additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. Our business could be materially adversely affected by the following factors, categorized by the primary nature of the associated risk, related to COVID-19:\nOperational Impacts\n\u25cf Our rental product business is dependent upon special occasions with large gatherings of people, including proms and weddings. Beginning in early March 2020, we experienced and continue to experience a significant decrease in store traffic and comparable sales as well as cancellations of high school proms and other events. Our rental product business is a material source of our overall profitability and the cancellations/postponement of such events, particularly with regards to proms which are unlikely to be rescheduled, will negatively impact our results of operations.\n\u25cf On March 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of our retail locations in the U.S. and Canada starting March 17, 2020 through March 28, 2020. On March 19, 2020, we announced the closure of our e-commerce fulfillment centers starting March 20, 2020 through March 28, 2020.\nOn March 26, 2020, we extended the temporary closing of our retail stores until at least May 4, 2020. In conjunction with our decision to extend the temporary closure of our stores, we have also furloughed all of our U.S. store employees as well as a significant portion of employees in our U.S. distribution network and offices, and we implemented the temporary layoff of all Canadian store employees and a significant portion of Canadian employees in our Canadian distribution network and offices. It is not possible to predict the duration of these\ntemporary store closings, or to anticipate consumers\u2019 willingness to visit our stores and employees\u2019 willingness to staff our stores when they reopen. As a result of our temporary store closures, we may incur impairments to certain long-lived assets in our stores, goodwill and our Jos. A. Bank tradename, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, social distancing measures or changes in consumer spending behaviors may continue to impact our stores after they resume normal operations and such actions could materially impact our results of operations.\nFurthermore, in light of our store closures, we have taken certain actions with respect to some or all of our existing leases, including engaging with landlords to discuss rent reductions and/or rent deferrals, or discontinuing payment. We expect to continue to explore and take these and similar actions, which may subject us to legal, reputational and financial risks.\nOn March 31, 2020, we announced that, after instituting enhanced social distancing and sanitation protocols that meet or exceed those recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d), our e-commerce fulfillment centers were reopened. We will continue to monitor this ongoing situation, relying on recommendations from the CDC, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) and government officials to regularly evaluate the renewed operations at our e-commerce fulfillment centers and determine when currently closed stores will reopen.\n\u25cf Many of our vendors produce their products or source component parts of their products from areas affected by the virus and subject to factory closures or operational reductions and quarantines. As a result, we may experience disruptions in timely acquiring the merchandise we sell or rent to our customers. These disruptions and any future factory closures, reductions in factory operations or government imposed travel restrictions or quarantines could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf In order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of our decision to furlough a significant portion of our employees across the organization, it may become difficult for individuals to perform their control duties, which may increase the potential for error in our financial statements. In addition, we may need to consider the implementation of new controls or modification of existing controls in order to complete our financial reporting process and prepare our financial statements on a timely basis. If we conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it could result in lost investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability and completeness of our financial statements. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and/or our ability to access capital resources in the financial markets.\nLiquidity and Indebtedness Impacts\nWe have typically funded our operating costs, working capital requirements, repayment of our indebtedness and capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operating activities as well as availability under our ABL Facility. As reflected in our consolidated financial statements, as of February 1, 2020, we had $14.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, working capital of $206.4 million and long-term debt totaling $1.1 billion. In addition, as of February 1, 2020, $50.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under our ABL Facility and letters of credit totaling approximately $26.6 million were also issued and outstanding.\nOn March 16, 2020, we drew down $260.0 million under the ABL Facility. In addition, after assessing the remaining availability under the ABL Facility and determining that additional borrowings were prudent to maximize cash on hand, on March 19, 2020 and on March 31, 2020, respectively, we borrowed an additional $25.0 million under the ABL Facility. We note these borrowings under the ABL Facility are proactive measures in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global markets resulting from COVID-19. In addition, we are taking other measures to increase liquidity by eliminating or deferring most of our discretionary spending. For example, we are significantly reducing inventory purchases, capital expenditures, advertising spend and store and other general and administrative costs, including furloughing a significant portion of our employees and salary reductions. We are also engaging landlords to discuss possible rent reductions and/or rent deferrals. We cannot provide assurances that these measures will be successful, that our plans will not change or that circumstances will not change with regards to our ability to eliminate or defer discretionary spending.\nOur indebtedness contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratios, total leverage ratios and secured leverage ratios. Specifically, our ABL Facility requires us to comply with a financial maintenance covenant under certain circumstances. As a result of our $310.0 million in ABL borrowings during March 2020, the likelihood that this financial maintenance covenant may be triggered has increased and continued deterioration in operating results or other adverse factors could result in our being unable to comply with this financial maintenance covenant. If we violate this covenant and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under the ABL Facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other indebtedness. In addition, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. An acceleration of the indebtedness under our Credit Facilities would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our Senior Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are protracted and we are unable to increase liquidity and/or effectively address our debt position, we may be forced to scale back or terminate operations and/or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws. This could result in a complete loss of shareholder value.\nRisks Associated with our Business Strategy\nAs discussed in Item 1. Business, our overall business strategy is focused on several initiatives. If we cannot successfully execute our business strategy, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. There are numerous risks associated with this strategy including, but not limited to, the following:\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to meet the changing style preferences and shopping expectations of our customers and manage merchandise lead times.\nOur success is dependent in part upon our ability to meet evolving customer expectations and gauge the tastes of our customers, and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. As some of our businesses are seasonal, we must purchase and carry a significant amount of inventory prior to peak selling seasons.\nBecause of manufacturing lead times, we order merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts. In addition, manufacturing lead times may make it more difficult for us to respond quickly to new or changing merchandise trends or consumer acceptance or rejection of our products. As a result, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to meet the changing preferences of our customers and manage merchandise lead times appropriately.\nWe believe our overall product mix makes our business less vulnerable to changes in merchandise trends than many fashion-forward and specialty apparel retailers; however, our sales and profitability depend upon our continued ability to effectively manage a variety of competitive challenges, including:\n\u25cf anticipating and quickly responding to changing trends and consumer demands including the ongoing casualization of workplace attire;\n\u25cf maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;\n\u25cf developing innovative, high-quality new products and/or product and brand extensions in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes, including custom clothing;\n\u25cf competitively pricing our products and providing superior service and value to our customers;\n\u25cf countering the promotional or other pricing activities of our competitors; and\n\u25cf providing effective and efficient marketing support.\nIncreased competition or our failure to meet these competitive challenges could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and/or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our strategies, including product innovations and expanding our exclusive offerings, may present greater risks.\nWe are continuously assessing opportunities to improve store productivity and develop new store concepts and complementary products and services related to our retail and rental businesses, including product innovations and exclusive offerings. We may expend both capital and management resources on such business opportunities, which may or may not be successful. Additionally, any new concept is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation and the ability to obtain suitable sites. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow new concepts, including product innovations and exclusive offerings, to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow.\nOur investments in omni-channel initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.\nOne of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers to provide inspiring and seamless experiences in and across every channel including our store and e-commerce channels. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology systems. If the implementation of our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our omni-channel investments that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe face challenges in managing our store fleet, including limited new store growth potential.\nOur growth is dependent, in large part, on our ability to successfully manage our store fleet, including new stores, expansion or remodeling of existing stores, closure of underperforming stores and other investments in our store fleet. We may continue opening new stores to increase our sales volume and profitability; however, we believe that our ability to increase the number of new stores in the U.S. and Canada may be limited. Therefore, we may be limited in our ability to increase our sales volume and profitability by increasing the number of our stores.\nIn addition, our ability to manage our store fleet will depend on our ability to obtain suitable locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, achieve sufficient levels of cash flow to support investments in our store fleet, hire qualified employees and open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis. Further, the results achieved by our existing stores may not be indicative of the performance or market acceptance of stores in other locations and the opening of new stores in existing markets may adversely affect sales and/or profitability of established stores in those same markets.\nAny future acquisitions or divestitures could result in operating difficulties and could harm our operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions or divestitures that would further our strategic objectives. Acquisitions are subject to a variety of risks, including risks associated with an ability to integrate acquired assets, systems or operations into our existing operations, diversion of management\u2019s attention from core operational matters, higher costs, or unexpected difficulties or problems with acquired assets or entities, outdated or incompatible technologies, labor difficulties or an inability to realize anticipated synergies and efficiencies, whether within anticipated time frames or at all.\nDivestitures are similarly subject to a variety of risks, including risks associated with difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, liabilities for activities of the divested business before the transaction, including litigation claims and disputes and the need to provide transition services to a divested business, which may result in the diversion of management resources and focus, and potential impairment charges.\nIf any of these risks related to future acquisitions or divestitures are realized, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with General Economic Conditions\nNumerous economic conditions, all of which are outside of our control, could negatively affect the level of consumer spending on the merchandise that we offer. If these economic conditions persist for a sustained period, our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. These economic conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\nOur business is particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence.\nOur performance is subject to changes in U.S., Canadian, and global economic and political conditions, particularly their impact on the level of consumer discretionary spending and consumer confidence. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, increases in the cost of non-discretionary consumer goods, increases in consumer debt levels and applicable interest rates, political and regulatory uncertainty, uncertainties regarding future economic prospects or a decline in consumer confidence or credit availability. Consumer confidence may also be adversely affected by national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism, public health events or natural disasters (or the threat of any of these). In addition, our reliance on certain external partners leaves us subject to certain risks should one or more of these external partners encounter financial distress, become insolvent or are otherwise unable to perform.\nDuring an actual or perceived economic downturn, fewer customers may shop with us and those who do shop may limit the amounts of their purchases. As a result, we could be required to take significant markdowns and/or increase our marketing and promotional expenses in response to the lower than anticipated levels of demand for our products. In addition, promotional and/or prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our sales and expect our sales to fluctuate in the future.\nOur success over the long-term depends in large part on our ability to generate profitable sales. For example, if sales at Men\u2019s Wearhouse decrease for a sustained period of time (as was the case in fiscal 2019), the effect on our consolidated financial results would be more significant than if sales were to decrease at any of our other brands. We believe that a variety of factors affect our sales and comparable sales results including, but not limited to: consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending; changes in economic conditions and consumer disposable income; spending patterns and debt levels; government shutdowns; consumer credit availability; weather conditions; the timing of certain holiday seasons; the number and timing of new store openings; changes in the popularity of a retail center; the timing and level of promotional pricing or markdowns; store closings, refreshes, relocations and remodels; changes in fashion trends (including casualization of workplace attire and custom clothing) and our merchandise mix or other competitive factors. Comparable sales fluctuations may impact our ability to leverage our fixed direct expenses, including store rent and store asset depreciation, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonality.\nOur sales and net earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations and may vary by brand. Our rental product revenues are heavily concentrated in the second and third quarters (prom and wedding season) while the fourth quarter is the seasonal low point. Because of these fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year.\nRisks Associated With Our Sourcing and Distribution Strategies\nOur sourcing and distribution strategies are subject to numerous risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nThe loss of, or disruption in, our distribution centers could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores.\nWe rely on our distribution centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of our merchandise. As such, we depend on the overall effective management of our distribution center operations including adherence to shipping schedules and proper functioning of our information technology and inventory control systems. Events such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, government shutdowns, delays in customs clearances, software malfunctions, employee matters or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores or directly to customers. For example, on March 19, 2020, in light of evolving government and citizen response to COVID-19, we announced the closure of our e-commerce fulfillment centers starting March 20, 2020 through at least March 28, 2020, which resulted in the disruption of and delayed deliveries to customers. In addition, given our proximity\nto the Texas gulf coast, it is possible that a hurricane or tropical storm could damage the Houston, Texas distribution center, result in extended power outages or flood roadways into and around the distribution center, any of which would disrupt or delay deliveries to the Houston distribution center and to our stores.\nAlthough we have disaster recovery plans and maintain business interruption and property insurance, there can be no assurance that these plans will work as intended, that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid timely to us, in the event any of our distribution centers are damaged or shut down for any reason, or if we incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption at one or more of our distribution centers.\nOur business is global in scope and can be impacted by factors beyond our control.\nAs a result of our Canadian operations and our sourcing of merchandise and rental product from manufacturers located outside of the U.S., we face the possibility of greater losses from a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors that are beyond our control. Such factors that could harm our financial condition and results of operations include, among other things:\n\u25cf political instability, civil strife or insurrection, or acts of terrorism, which disrupt trade with the countries where we operate or in which our contractors, suppliers or customers are located;\n\u25cf recessions in foreign economies;\n\u25cf infrastructure deficiencies, logistic and other challenges in managing our foreign operations;\n\u25cf imposition of new legislation or rules relating to imports that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the U.S. from certain countries or regions;\n\u25cf obligations associated with being an importer of record, including monitoring and complying with all corresponding legal requirements;\n\u25cf imposition of new or higher duties, taxes, tariffs, quotas or other charges on imports;\n\u25cf delays in shipping due to port security considerations, labor disputes or other restrictions;\n\u25cf supply chain disruptions as a result of climate change;\n\u25cf issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity;\n\u25cf volatile global economic, market or political environments;\n\u25cf public health crises, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19;\n\u25cf volatile shipping availability, fuel supplies and related costs;\n\u25cf the fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies used by our manufacturers; and\n\u25cf increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn addition, if we were unexpectedly required to change manufacturers or if a significant manufacturer were unable to supply acceptable merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms, particularly as it relates to custom clothing, we could experience a disruption in the supply of merchandise or may not be able to fulfill certain customer orders.\nFailure of manufacturers to adhere to applicable laws and regulations including our internal policy requirements could harm our business.\nWe require our third-party manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal policy requirements. Our business could be adversely affected if our suppliers do not comply with applicable legal requirements, our supplier policies and practices generally acceptable in the U.S. regarding social and ethical matters and acceptable labor and sourcing practices (collectively, \u201cSupplier Requirements\u201d).\nThe violation of our Supplier Requirements by any of our suppliers could disrupt our supply chain. In addition, any such violation could damage our reputation, which may result in decreased customer traffic to our stores, websites and call center. In the event of any violations, we may decide that it is necessary or desirable to seek alternative suppliers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased costs of the raw materials and other resources that are important to our business.\nThe raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, catastrophic events, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. In addition, our transportation and labor costs are subject to price volatility caused by the price of oil, supply of labor, labor disputes, governmental regulations, economic climate, public health crises and other unpredictable factors. Increases in demand for, or the price of, raw materials, distribution services and labor, including federal and state minimum wage rates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe increase in the costs of wool and other raw materials significant to the manufacture of apparel and the costs of manufacturing could materially affect our results of operations to the extent they cannot be mitigated through price increases and relocation to lower cost sources of supply or other cost reductions.\nWe source our products globally, therefore, we may be impacted by tariffs primarily with respect to certain products imported from foreign countries.\nMost of our merchandise is produced in foreign countries, making the price and availability of our merchandise susceptible to international trade risks, including the imposition of tariffs. In recent years, the U.S. has imposed significant tariffs on certain goods imported from China and expressed a willingness to impose further tariffs on additional goods imported from China and other countries. Although we believe the impact of tariffs enacted to date was immaterial to our fiscal 2019 results, given the unpredictability of the imposition of future tariffs, as well as the potential for additional trade actions by the U.S. or other countries, the impact of current or future tariffs on our ongoing operations and results is uncertain and could be significant, and we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to address the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. To the extent that our supply chain, costs, sales or profitability are negatively affected by tariffs or other trade actions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nAny significant interruption in delivery of raw materials could cause interruptions that may delay the manufacture of our products.\nThe principal raw material used to manufacture our products is fabric. We do not have any long-term agreements in place with fabric suppliers; therefore, there can be no assurance that any of such suppliers will continue to do business with us in the future. If a particular mill were to experience a delay due to fire or natural disaster and become unable to meet our supply needs, it could take a period of up to several months for us to arrange for and receive an alternate supply of such fabric. In addition, import and export delays caused, for example, by an extended strike at the port of entry, could prevent third-party manufacturers as well as our U.S. tailored clothing factory from receiving fabric or other raw materials shipped by suppliers. Therefore, if there is an unexpected loss of a supplier of fabric or other raw materials or a long interruption in shipments from any fabric or other raw material supplier, including delays related to public health crises (such as COVID-19), our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nLabor union disputes could impact our business.\nShould a labor dispute arise at any one of our union work sites, anywhere along our supply chain, or at any shopping center where we have a store, we could experience shortages in product to sell in our stores or other operational disruptions.\nRisks Associated with Our Information Technology Systems\nWe rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. Information technology systems are subject to numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems, system failures, rapid technological change, failure of the systems to operate as anticipated, reliance on third-party technologies, the lack of available expertise for legacy systems,\nnetwork and software providers, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, data breaches, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing attacks, and other similar disruptions, any of which could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nIf we are unable to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively, our business could be disrupted or our sales or profitability could be reduced.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and successfully implement new technologies, systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery systems. We also maintain multiple internet websites in the U.S. In addition, we must protect the confidentiality of our and our customers\u2019 data. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability.\nWe are subject to data security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.\nLike all other retailers, we are subject to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes, and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, use, manipulation, exfiltration, or damage. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information as well as proprietary company information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees and other third parties. As a result, like other retailers, our business may be targeted more than other businesses because third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that we maintain and transmit. To date, we believe cybersecurity incidents have not had a material adverse impact on our business. We may, however, experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency and/or sophistication and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cybersecurity incidents.\nWe are focused on safeguarding and protecting personal and business information, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes including providing employee awareness training around cyber risks and security breaches. However, while we have implemented measures reasonably designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our systems or our third-party service providers\u2019 systems may still be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents including attacks by unauthorized users, corruption by computer viruses or other malicious software code, emerging cybersecurity risks, inadvertent or intentional release of confidential or proprietary information, or other similar events. The occurrence of any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of information about us or our customers, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could, among other things:\n\u25cf cause damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf allow competitors access to our proprietary business information;\n\u25cf subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard customer data;\n\u25cf subject us to financial and legal risks, including regulatory action or litigation;\n\u25cf impact our ability to process credit card transactions; and\n\u25cf require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach.\nFurthermore, the storage and transmission of such data is regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance with those changes, may result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data. If we or our employees fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to fines, penalties, administrative orders and other legal risks as a result of a breach or non-compliance. In addition, the CCPA may restrict our ability to use personal California user and subscriber\ninformation in connection with our various products, services and operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\nOur business is subject to numerous other risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nWe may be negatively impacted by competition.\nThe men\u2019s retail industry in which we operate is highly competitive with numerous participants. We compete with traditional department stores, other specialty men\u2019s clothing stores, online retailers, online formalwear rental providers, off-price retailers, manufacturer-owned and independently-owned outlet stores, independently-owned formalwear rental stores, as well as their respective e-commerce channels. In addition, some of our primary competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls or retail centers as our stores, which results in competition for favorable site locations and lease terms in these shopping malls and retail centers. Increased competition or our failure to meet these competitive challenges could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our management team and other key employees, including our customer facing employees. In 2019, we experienced a number of significant leadership changes including appointing a new Chief Executive Officer, the departures of our Brand President of Jos. A. Bank and our Chief Human Resources Officer and the creation of a new Chief Customer Officer role providing common leadership for our retail brands. Although we believe we have a strong team with significant industry expertise, we face intense competition in hiring and retaining these employees and the extended loss of the services of key people could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, sick pay, paid time off and healthcare benefits. The implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to these items, among other things, could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results.\nIf we are unable to retain and motivate our current employees and attract talented new employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of an event that impacts our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brands. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity and customer service. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Public perception about our company as a whole, our products or our stores, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls and provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to prevent security breaches could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as require additional time and resources to rebuild our reputation.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and service marks, as described in Item 1. Business, are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to establishing and protecting our trademarks and service marks. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken, including to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks, may not be adequate to prevent others from imitating our products or to prevent\nothers from seeking to block sales of our products. Other parties may also claim that some of our products infringe on their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Litigation regarding our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWar, acts of terrorism, public health crises, or weather catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the event of war, acts of terrorism or the threat of terrorist attacks, public health crises, or weather catastrophes, consumer spending could significantly decrease for a sustained period. In addition, local authorities or shopping center management could close in response to any immediate security concern, public health concern or weather catastrophe such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Similarly, war, acts of terrorism, threats of terrorist attacks, public health crises or a weather catastrophe could severely and adversely affect our offices, distribution centers, or our entire supply chain.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of formation and our amended and restated bylaws, Texas law, and our short-term shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay a potential acquisition of control of our Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of formation, amended and restated bylaws and the laws in the State of Texas contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the prospective acquirer and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. Texas law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. In March 2020, the Board of Directors adopted a short-term shareholder rights plan, which may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire control of the Company on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.\nWe believe that these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by effectively requiring those who seek to obtain control of the Company to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition of control. However, these provisions could apply even if an acquisition of control of the Company may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition of control that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders.\nOur business could be adversely impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engages in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance. The Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful, and we may be subject to formal or informal actions or requests from shareholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, divert attention of management and employees, and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flow and the market price of our common stock.\nFluctuations in exchange rates may cause us to experience currency exchange losses.\nWe are subject to exposure from fluctuations in U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) exchange rates as a result of our direct sourcing programs and our operations in Canada. Moores, our Canadian subsidiary, conducts most of its business in CAD but purchases a significant portion of its merchandise in U.S. dollars. Historically, the exchange rate between CAD and U.S. dollars has fluctuated. A decline in the value of the CAD as compared to the U.S. dollar may adversely impact our Canadian operations as the revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to U.S. dollars. Also, the value of our Canadian net assets as expressed in U.S. dollars may decline. We utilize foreign currency hedging contracts related to our merchandise purchases to limit exposure to changes in U.S. dollar/CAD exchange rates; however, these hedging activities may not adequately protect our Canadian operations from exchange rate risk.\nCompliance with ever-changing legal, regulatory and corporate governance requirements and standards for accounting could result in increased administrative expenses or litigation and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and reported financial results.\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable laws, regulations, accounting and reporting requirements, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Affordable Care Act, the payment card industry (PCI), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the NYSE. In addition, our business is subject to laws, rules and regulations promulgated by international, national, state and local authorities, including laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy, use of consumer information, credit cards and advertising. All of these laws, rules and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change and often their application may be unclear. As a result, from time to time, we are subject to inquiries, investigations, and/or litigation, including class action lawsuits, and administrative actions related to compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nShareholder activism, the current political environment, financial reform legislation and instances of government intervention and regulatory reform has led, and may continue to lead, to substantial new regulations and compliance obligations. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, or privacy, among other things, may increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance.\nFailure to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change concerns may negatively affect our business.\nConcern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation, and utility increases, which could adversely affect our business. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters, including the use of plastic, energy, waste, and worker safety. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or losses by taxing jurisdictions or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.\nFor example, in 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. In the future, the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered. Any new interpretations or guidance on the Tax Reform Act could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges to accounting standards and estimates could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and the related authoritative guidance for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, leases and income taxes, are complex, continually evolving and involve subjective judgments. For example, recently adopted authoritative guidance for lease accounting resulted in a significant increase in our assets and liabilities given we have a considerable number of operating leases. These and other future changes in accounting rules or changes in the underlying estimates, assumptions or judgments by our management could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe could incur losses due to impairment on long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. In the future, significant negative industry or general economic trends (including the impact of COVID-19), unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations or a significant sustained decline in the market price of our common stock may result in additional impairments to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of long-lived assets, goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nOur advertising, marketing and promotional activities have been the subject of review by state regulators and subject to lawsuits.\nIn the past we have been, and may from time to time in the future be, required to respond to inquiries from State Attorneys General related to our advertising practices. These advertising practices have also been, and continue to be, the subject of class action litigation. In addition, it is possible that the advertising, marketing and promotional activities of all our brands may be reviewed by state or other regulators or become the subject of litigation. Although we endeavor to monitor and comply with all applicable laws and regulations to ensure that all advertising, marketing and promotional activities comply with all applicable legal requirements, many of the applicable legal requirements involve subjective judgments. It is possible that any resolution we may reach with any governmental authority or the results of any litigation may materially impact our current or future planned marketing program and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims, from time to time, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAs a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (\u201cActions\u201d) arising in the ordinary course of business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actions are filed against us from time to time and include commercial, securities, intellectual property, customer, employment and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. Current Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in whole or in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of any of the Actions brought against us and an adverse result in any Actions could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nRights of our shareholders may be negatively affected if we issue any of the shares of preferred stock which our Board of Directors has authorized for issuance.\nWe have available for issuance 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. Our Board is authorized to issue any or all of this preferred stock, in one or more series, without any further action on the part of shareholders. The rights of our shareholders may be negatively affected if we issue a series of preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or distribution upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. See Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOur stock price is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Future announcements or management discussions concerning us or our competitors, sales and profitability results, quarterly variations in operating results or comparable sales, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or others, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, broad market and industry factors may adversely impact the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nRisks Associated with Our Indebtedness\nThere are numerous risks associated with our indebtedness including, but not limited to, the following:\nOur current level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nAs of February 1, 2020, we have $881.6 million outstanding our on Term Loan Facility (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), which matures on April 9, 2025, subject to a springing maturity provision that would accelerate the maturity of the Term Loan to April 1, 2022 if any of the Company\u2019s obligations under its Senior Notes remain outstanding on April 1, 2022. In October 2017, we amended our then existing $500.0 million asset-based revolving facility in part to increase the principal amount available to $550.0 million and extend the maturity date to October 2022 (the amended \u201cABL Facility\u201d) (the ABL Facility together with the Term Loan, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). Also, as of February 1, 2020, $173.8 million of our 7.0% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) are outstanding. In summary, as of February 1, 2020, our total indebtedness is approximately $1.1 billion. In addition, as of February 1, 2020, we had up to $400.5 million of additional borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, excluding letters of credit totaling approximately $26.6 million issued and outstanding. Subsequent to February 1, 2020, in response to COVID-19 and as a proactive measure, on March 16, 2020, we executed a borrowing of $260.0 million under our ABL Facility. In addition, after assessing the remaining availability under the ABL Facility and determining that additional borrowings were prudent to maximize cash on hand, on March 19, 2020 and on March 31, 2020, respectively, we borrowed an additional $25.0 million under the ABL Facility.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes;\n\u25cf restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt than we do and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from exploiting.\nDespite our indebtedness level, we will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings, including borrowings under the ABL Facility, will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes contain restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition.\nIn addition, we rely on our subsidiaries to generate cash. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, is dependent, to a certain extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Each of our subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and they do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Senior Notes or to make funds available for that purpose (other than the subsidiary guarantors in connection with their guarantees) or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness or to fund our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other cash obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, the holders of the Senior Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding amounts under such facilities due and payable and, with respect to the ABL Facility, terminate their commitments to loan money, and, in each case, foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under the Credit Facilities, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability to:\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u25cf pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf issue capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf incur liens;\n\u25cf prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; and\n\u25cf enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates.\nThese covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the ABL Facility requires us to comply with a financial maintenance covenant under certain circumstances. As a result of our $310.0 million borrowings in March 2020, the likelihood that this financial maintenance covenant may be triggered has increased and continued deterioration in operating results or other adverse factors could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility, if applicable. If we violate this covenant and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under the ABL Facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other indebtedness. In addition, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk through our variable rate borrowings under the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under such facilities bear interest at a variable rate, based on a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels but may increase. Should interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Currently, we are exposed to interest rate risk on our Term Loan and borrowings on our ABL Facility. To partially mitigate such interest rate risk, we entered into interest rate swaps to exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed interest rate payments for a portion of the outstanding Term Loan balance. At February 1, 2020, the notional amount of the interest rate swaps totaled $705.0 million. As of February 1, 2020, approximately 80% of our Term Loan was at a fixed rate with the remainder at a variable rate. As a result, we believe our interest rate risk is substantially mitigated. After considering the impact of these interest rate swaps, at February 1, 2020, the effect of a one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $1.8 million change in annual interest expense on our Term Loan. At February 1, 2020, assuming all capacity under the ABL Facility is fully drawn, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $5.5 million change in annual interest expense.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). The first publication of SOFR was released in April 2018. Since the initial publication of SOFR in 2018, daily changes in SOFR have at times been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates.\nWhether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain, which also may impact the accounting for our existing interest rate swaps. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition and may be subject to disputes or litigation related to our Credit Facilities over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We will continue to monitor developments with respect to the phasing out of LIBOR and will work to minimize the impact of any LIBOR transition.", "PERMNO": 77516, "SIC": 5600, "TIC": "TLRDQ"}
