Risk Factors\nIn addition to the negative implications of all information and financial data included in or referred to directly in this report, you should consider the following risk factors. This report contains forward-looking statements and information concerning us, our plans, and other future events. Those statements should be read together with the discussion of risk factors set forth below, because those risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Application to Operate as a Securities Broker-Dealer\nWe cannot assure that FFIN will complete the required steps to become a U.S. securities broker-dealer.\nFFIN recently withdrew its application to become a member of FINRA and to register as a broker-dealer with the SEC to allow it more time to gather and provide additional information to FINRA and to decide whether to resubmit its new membership application. Applications for licensure, particularly the FINRA application, are technical and complicated and require substantial information about FFIN, its operations, our company, our stockholders and management. Application for FINRA membership must satisfy stringent requirements, and approval is subject to substantial discretion. FFIN cannot commence business as a U.S. securities broker-dealer until all applications are refiled and approved, and we cannot assure refiling or approval. Further, before FFIN can commence operations as a U.S. securities broker-dealer it will also need to establish a clearing arrangement with a U.S. clearing broker to hold customer funds and securities and process transactions, and we cannot assure that FFIN will be able to do so. FFIN\u2019s inability to complete the licensing and membership requirements to become a U.S. broker-dealer does not preclude us from completing the acquisitions of Freedom RU, Freedom KZ, and Freedom CY, but the inability to use FFIN to execute securities transactions in the United States on behalf of the customers of Freedom RU, Freedom KZ, and Freedom CY may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nWe may have to reconsider our core business strategy if we are unable to provide the Freedom Companies\u2019 clients access to the U.S. securities markets.\nThe core of our long-term strategy is to access U.S. securities markets: directly with a subsidiary that is a registered broker-dealer; indirectly through ownership of a minority interest in another broker-dealer augmented by strategic operating relationships with the Freedom brokers; or merely through strategic relationships with other broker-dealers. FFIN is currently assessing whether to reapply to become a registered broker-dealer in the U.S. If it elects to do so, there is no guarantee such application will be successful. Should FFIN elect not to refile, or if it is unsuccessful in the application process, there is likewise no guarantee that we would be able to acquire a minority interest in another broker-dealer, or establish strategic relationships with other broker-dealers registered in the U.S. If we are unable to provide the customers of the Freedom Companies access, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. securities markets our business and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted and we may have to reconsider our core business strategy.\nRegulatory authorities may impose substantial restrictions on the nature and extent of our proposed activities as a condition to approval of a FINRA membership application.\nApplications to regulatory authorities, particularly for membership in FINRA, are subject to substantive review under a number of regulatory criteria. Pursuant to its discretion, FINRA typically imposes restrictions on the activities of new members to limit certain kinds or amounts of activities that may adversely impact a firm\u2019s financial integrity or expose its customers to risk. These restrictions may expire after a designated period or may be lifted after specified operating conditions are met. We cannot predict the nature of such new membership restrictions or the extent to which they will limit FFIN\u2019s proposed activities.\nWe may need to change our proposed plan of operation, management and supervisory personnel and procedures, and operating systems in order to overcome objections from authorities.\nNew membership applications filed with FINRA include detailed information about the manner in which an applicant proposes to conduct business; the applicant\u2019s management and supervisory personnel and procedures; transaction processing, recordkeeping, and reporting; satisfaction of monitoring and compliance requirements; administrative and customer relations protocols; and other matters. FFIN submitted a new membership application to FINRA in December 2015, which it recently withdrew to allow itself additional time to collect information requested by FINRA. FFIN is currently assessing whether to re-submit its new membership application to FINRA. If FFIN elects to pursue reapplication, we anticipate it will do so before the end of calendar 2016. We may be required to change or supplement our current plans, arrangements, and personnel to overcome comments or objections to any new membership application filed by FFIN. These changes may cause delays or additional costs and may be inconsistent with our current business plan and overall strategy. We cannot predict the nature or extent of any conditions that may be imposed or their impact on our proposed activities.\nThere is no arrangement for us to rescind the transaction through which we issued what is now 80.1% of our outstanding common stock in consideration of the acquisition of 100% ownership of FFIN if FFIN cannot become licensed as a U.S. securities broker-dealer.\nUnder the Acquisition Agreement, we issued 224,551,913 shares, or approximately 80.1% of our outstanding common stock, in consideration of our acquisition of 100% of the ownership of FFIN. We cannot assure that FFIN can meet the applicable requirements or that FFIN will successfully complete the steps required to become a U.S. broker-dealer. If FFIN fails to become a U.S. broker-dealer, the foundation of our proposed international financial services firm may be substantially undermined and devalued. We cannot assure that we would be able to identify and implement alternative ways to serve international securities customers, including customers of the Freedom Companies. We do not have the right to rescind the acquisition of FFIN and recover the shares issued in the transaction if FFIN\u2019s efforts to become a U.S. broker-dealer are not successful, even if the value of FFIN to us would be reduced substantially.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Acquisitions\nWe cannot assure when or whether our proposed acquisitions of Freedom RU, including its subsidiary Freedom KZ, which operate as securities broker-dealers in Russia and Kazakhstan, and Freedom CY, which operates as a broker-dealer in Cyprus, may be completed.\nThe Acquisition Agreement under which we propose to acquire Freedom RU, including its subsidiary Freedom KZ, and Freedom CY, specifies that our acquisition of any individual Freedom Company will not be completed until such companies complete and provide audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and GAAS and the requirements of the SEC. The books and records of each of these companies have been maintained under accounting principles and regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions of organization, operation, and regulation that are materially different and perhaps less rigorous than GAAP and GAAS in the United States and SEC requirements. We cannot assure when or whether the Freedom Companies can meet these financial statement requirements. The acquisition of Freedom RU is further conditioned on the satisfaction of specified regulatory requirements in Kazakhstan applicable to Freedom KZ.\nThe completion of any acquisition is further dependent on us having a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares to issue the amount of stock that we agreed to issue in the Acquisition Agreement. If, at the time of a proposed acquisition, we do have a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares to complete the transaction, we have agreed to effect a recapitalization consisting of a reverse-split of our outstanding common stock and, possibly, a change in the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue, in each case to such number as the board of directors may determine. Mr. Turlov, our principal stockholder, will have the power to authorize this action without the vote of any other stockholder, so approval of the recapitalization is assured. The acquisition of Freedom RU and its subsidiary Freedom KZ is separate from the acquisition of Freedom CY, so both, one, or neither of these acquisitions may be completed.\nEach of the acquisitions is also subject to the satisfaction of a number of additional conditions that are beyond our control that may prevent, delay, or otherwise adversely affect the completion of one or both of the proposed acquisitions, including the continued accuracy of several representations and warranties, some of which may be waived. We cannot predict whether or when any of these conditions will be satisfied. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to the acquisitions, we expect, but cannot assure, the completion of both acquisitions before the end of calendar 2016. Any of the proposed acquisitions may be abandoned if not closed by that date.\nThe percentage ownership of our stockholders has been reduced substantially as a result of our acquisition of FFIN and will be further substantially reduced as a result of the completion of the proposed acquisitions.\nAs a result of the acquisition of FFIN, stockholders that previously owned 100% of our outstanding stock now own approximately 19.9% of our stock. If the proposed acquisitions of Freedom RU and Freedom CY are completed, the ownership of the stockholders that owned 100% of our outstanding stock before signing the Acquisition Agreement will own an aggregate of approximately 5% of our common stock. We cannot assure that the value of the retained stock of the stockholders that owned 100% of our outstanding stock is or will be greater when their ownership is reduced to approximately 19.9% or 5% as a result of the transfer of assets and operations to the Company as consideration for the issuance of a controlling interest in the Company.\nThe Acquisition Agreement restricts the conduct of our business before the completion of the acquisitions and limits our ability to pursue alternative acquisition, expansion, or diversification alternatives.\nThe Acquisition Agreement restricts our ability to engage in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of our business pending the completion of the acquisitions, December 31, 2016, or the consent of Mr. Turlov, which may be granted or withheld in his absolute discretion. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business.\nOur failure to complete the proposed acquisitions could negatively impact the trading price for our common stock and our future business and financial results.\nIf one or both acquisitions are not completed, the trading price for our common stock and our business may be adversely affected by several risks and consequences. For example, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets about our ongoing viability and concerns that we may seek other activities and operations that may expose us to further risks. Further, while we are prohibited by the terms of the Acquisition Agreement from pursuing other opportunities, we may miss opportunities to expand or enter into new business or financial transactions that have attractive potential to provide value to our stockholders. We cannot assure that Mr. Turlov, whose consent is required in order to enter into a transaction other than in the ordinary course of business, would consent. He is under no obligation to provide his consent.\nTimur Turlov will be subject to significant conflicts of interest in connection with the Acquisition Agreement.\nTimur Turlov will be required to make decisions about his performance under and compliance with the terms and conditions to which he is subject under the Acquisition Agreement while he is also our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling stockholder and, therefore, has a fiduciary duty to us and our stockholders. Accordingly, he will be subject to substantial conflicts of interest in such matters. We have not adopted procedures to resolve these conflicts of interest in our favor. Further, we cannot assure that our intent to have all of our decisions respecting our performance under and compliance with the terms and conditions to which we are subject under the Acquisition Agreement determined by a majority of our disinterested, independent directors will eliminate all conflicts of interest to which such disinterested, independent directors may be subject.\nBecause we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE and NASDAQ corporate governance standards, and as a result, may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nUpon execution of the Acquisition Agreement, Mr. Turlov was issued 224,551,913 shares of our common stock, which constituted approximately 80.1% of our outstanding common stock after giving effect to the acquisition of FFIN. Mr. Turlov\u2019s ownership interest may increase to up to 95% of our outstanding common stock if the acquisitions of the Freedom Companies are successfully completed.\nAs a result of Mr. Turlov\u2019s acquisition of greater than 50% of the voting power of BMBM, we became a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE and NASDAQ. Controlled companies are exempt from compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE and NASDAQ regarding majority board independence or the independence requirements relating to certain compensation and nominating committee decisions, and in the case of the NYSE, corporate governance committees. We are not currently subject to the corporate governance standards of the NYSE or NASDAQ, but should we at some future date become subject to such standards while still being a controlled company, we could be eligible to take advantage of the exemptions from compliance with such corporate governance standards. If we take advantage of the exemptions from compliance with such corporate governance standards, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMr. Turlov has control over key decision making as a result of his ownership of a majority of our voting stock.\nMr. Turlov, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, beneficially owns approximately 80.1% of our outstanding common stock, which could increase to as much as 95%. Mr. Turlov currently has sole voting control of BMBM and can control the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, the possible proposal to recapitalize us in order to enable the acquisitions of the Freedom Companies to be completed, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, Mr. Turlov has the ability to control our management and affairs as a result of his position as our chief executive officer and his ability to control the election of our directors. Additionally, in the event that Mr. Turlov controls BMBM at the time of his death, control may be transferred to a person or entity that he designates as his successor. As a board member and officer, Mr. Turlov owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Turlov is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nRisks Related to Effecting Securities Transactions for Foreign Customers\nAnti-money laundering obligations under the U.S. Patriot Act will require us to monitor and report suspicious activity impose special compliance obligations, expose us to compliance risks, and may adversely affect our customer relations.\nAnti-money laundering obligations under the U.S. Patriot Act will require us to adopt and implement a comprehensive compliance policy that will require us to review the identity and conduct of potential customers and the nature of their transactions with a view to determining whether they or their conduct is proscribed by law. If we determine to re-apply for registration as a securities broker-dealer and become a registered broker-dealer in the U.S., our efforts, in conjunction with a clearing firm, to obtain the required detailed information and documentation from customers, particularly in Russia and Kazakhstan, may be inconsistent with cultural norms and may adversely affect our customer relationships. If we reapply for and are able to obtain licensure, we will be obligated to report to federal officials our customers\u2019 suspicious activities, and our failure to do so timely, adequately, or accurately may expose us to sanctions.\nIf we are able to obtain necessary licensure, our business will depend on the ability of our clearing firm, on our behalf, to receive and transmit funds internationally.\nIf FFIN determines to reapply for and is able to obtain necessary licensure to operate as a U.S. securities broker-dealer, funds invested by our customers will be transmitted to a clearing firm and by it back to our customers through international banking electronic transfers, which can experience clerical and administrative mistakes, be subject to technical interruption, be delayed, or otherwise fail to work as planned. We will have no control over these funds transfers. Failures or substantial delays in funds transfers could impair our customer relationships.\nOur business may experience day-to-day operational delays and difficulties because of language differences.\nWe anticipate at least some of FFIN\u2019s proposed customers in Russia and Kazakhstan will not speak English at all, or sufficiently, to execute securities transactions in English. Accordingly, if FFIN determines to reapply and is able to obtain licensure to operate as a U.S. securities broker-dealer, it will depend on the local employees of the Freedom Companies to communicate and translate into English communications necessary to conduct business routinely and accurately. Errors in translation could result in errors in order execution, expose us to liability to customer losses, and impair our customer relationships.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) in our operations in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Cyprus.\nWe will be required to conduct our activities in or related to Russia, Kazakhstan, and Cyprus in compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Enforcement officials interpret the FCPA\u2019s prohibition on improper payments to government officials to apply to officials like those of the state-operated Federal Financial Markets Service of Russia, the Committee for the Control and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, the principal regulatory bodies that would control and monitor our operations in those countries. While our employees and agents will be required to acknowledge and comply with these laws, we cannot assure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may expose us to fines and other sanctions and adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nForeign laws, regulations, and policies may be changed in ways that could adversely impact our business.\nIf we determine to reapply for and are successful in obtaining necessary licensure to operate as a securities broker-dealer in the U.S., our proposed securities broker-dealer activities for customers in Russia and Kazakhstan are and will continue to be subject to ongoing uncertainties and risks, including:\n\u25cf\npossible changes in government personnel, the development of new administrative policies, practices, and political conditions in Russia, Kazakhstan, or Cyprus that may affect the enforcement or administration of laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\npossible changes to the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to our customers or us or the securities business generally;\n\u25cf\nthe potential adoption of entirely new regulatory regimes for foreign investment, the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries, and the permitted financial activities of residents;\n\u25cf\nuncertainties as to whether the laws and regulations will be applicable in any particular circumstance;\n\u25cf\nuncertainties as to whether we will be able to enforce our legal rights in Russia, Kazakhstan, or Cyprus;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty as to whether we will be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the applicable governing authorities, our compliance with governmental requirements;\n\u25cf\ncurrency exchange rates, regulations, or limitations;\n\u25cf\npolitical instability and possible changes in government;\n\u25cf\nlocal and national tax requirements;\n\u25cf\nexpropriation or nationalization of private enterprises and other risks arising out of foreign government sovereignty over properties in Russia, Kazakhstan, or Cyprus; and\n\u25cf\npossible significant delays in obtaining governmental authorizations, consents, or approvals of applicable requirements.\nOur customers will be concentrated in Russia and Kazakhstan such that any impediment to their investments and other activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRussia, Kazakhstan, and Cyprus have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\nRussia, Kazakhstan, and Cyprus have regulatory regimes governing the operation of broker-dealers within those countries, the transfer of funds to and from such countries, and other aspects of the finance and investment industries. These provisions were promulgated during changing political circumstances, are continuing to change, and may be relatively untested, particularly insofar as they apply to foreign investments by residents. Therefore, there is little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regimes will affect our proposed operations. It is possible that those governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations, administrative practices or policies, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations will materially and adversely affect our activities in Russia, Kazakhstan, or Cyprus. For example, certain of the laws of Russia and Kazakhstan may reflect reactions to international sanctions in response to Russian actions in Crimea and Ukraine. Further, since the history and practice of industry regulation is sparse, our activities may be particularly vulnerable to the decisions and positions of individuals, who may change, be subject to external pressures, or administer policies inconsistently. Internal bureaucratic politics may have unpredictable and negative consequences.\nThe rate of privatization of industries in Kazakhstan could affect its business.\nThe expansion of Freedom KZ since its organization in 2006 has benefited from the privatization of industries and companies in that country, which has led to significant growth in investments by individuals, which in turn has increased the number of Freedom KZ\u2019s customer accounts. The Kazakh government has announced that it intends to continue privatization of companies in various industries in that country through public offerings of securities. Recently, Kazakhstan has engaged in initial public offerings to privatize companies in the oil and gas and energy distribution segments, and has announced plans for initial public offerings for companies in transportation, healthcare, energy services and other segments. We cannot assure that any continued privatization in Kazakhstan will result in increased customer accounts or securities transactions by persons in that country.\nThe ongoing political and economic uncertainties affecting Russia and, to a lesser extent, Kazakhstan and collateral financial issues may adversely affect our proposed activities.\nRussia and, to a lesser extent, Kazakhstan continue to be impacted by changing policies that may reflect reactions to international sanctions against Russia in response to Russian actions in Crimea and Ukraine. Further, economic, domestic, and international political circumstances in the area may change. The economies of both Russia and Kazakhstan are substantially dependent on revenue from the production and sale of oil, which has declined substantially in price during the past year, resulting in economic pressures that continue to increase. These factors may adversely impact the economic stability of these countries and, in turn, the investment practices of our customers or the regulatory policies affecting their investments.\nIt may be difficult for us to enforce any civil liabilities against our customers that are outside the United States.\nIf we become a licensed securities broker-dealer in the U.S., we anticipate that initially almost all of our customers will be residents of countries outside of the U.S. and beyond the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. As a result, it may be difficult for us to enforce within the U.S. any claims or seek any remedies against such foreign persons, including claims, remedies, or judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any state. Instead, we, or our subsidiaries, may as a practical matter be forced to rely on remedies under foreign laws as interpreted and enforced by foreign courts, which generally would not enforce U.S. securities or other laws or enforce or interpret contracts consistent with U.S. legal principles or precedent. Further, such foreign courts and laws in Russia and Kazakhstan are based on non-Western principles of jurisprudence and may not provide the same kinds of remedies, relief, or procedural safeguards that are familiar in U.S. or Western legal systems.\nInternational currency exchange rates will affect the investment practices of our customers.\nThe customers of the Freedom Companies will seek to invest in U.S. securities in part to dampen the financial risk of domestic currency fluctuations and to invest in dollar-denominated securities. Even though the Freedom Companies\u2019 customers\u2019 investments are dollar-denominated, the funds available to customers to invest will depend on the rates at which the dollar is convertible into the currency of the country in which they reside-principally the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge. The values of the Russian ruble and Kazakh tenge declined approximately 50% and 40%, respectively, as compared to the U.S. dollar between June 2014 and November 2015, and will likely continue to fluctuate. Declines in the value of the Russian ruble or the Kazakh tenge compared to the dollar correspondingly reduce the amounts that residents of those countries have to invest in the United States. Conversely, increases in the value of the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge relative to the dollar reduces the financial advantage of investing in U.S. securities. Customer expectations respecting applicable currency exchange rates may affect the timing, number, and amounts of customer transactions in U.S. securities. Accordingly, our business will be affected substantially by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nRisks Related Generally to our Securities Business\nFFIN may face penalties or other sanctions that may be detrimental to our business if FFIN fails to comply with the comprehensive regulations administered by the SEC, state regulators, and FINRA.\nIf FFIN reapplies for and is able to obtain licensure to operate as a U.S. securities broker-dealer, it will be subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws respecting almost all aspects of its business, including:\n\u25cf\ncustomer accounts and customer transactions and interactions;\n\u25cf\nsales methods;\n\u25cf\ntrade practices among broker-dealers;\n\u25cf\ncapital structure;\n\u25cf\nrecordkeeping;\n\u25cf\nconduct of directors, officers, and employees; and\n\u25cf\nsupervision of employees.\nThe principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets, rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers.\nUncertainty regarding the application of these laws and other regulations to the business of a U.S. securities broker-dealer business may adversely affect the viability and profitability of its business. The SEC, FINRA, other self-regulatory organizations, and state securities authorities can censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. If it becomes licensed, FFIN\u2019s ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on its establishment, maintenance, and documentation of compliance procedures to ensure such compliance, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel. If it becomes licensed, FFIN could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed noncompliance in the future, and the imposition of any material penalties or orders on FFIN could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, it is possible that noncompliance could subject FFIN to future civil lawsuits, the outcome of which could harm our business. In addition, our mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by additional legislation; changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, state regulators, FINRA, and other regulatory and self-regulatory organizations; and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules.\nIf FFIN reapplies and becomes a licensed U.S. securities broker-dealer, its failure to remain in compliance with the net capital rule would adversely affect its ability to continue to operate, which could be a material factor if FFIN\u2019s net capital requirement were to increase substantially above its current anticipated $6,000 level.\nThe SEC, FINRA, and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules respecting the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers. Net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less certain deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from conservatively valuing certain other assets, all as calculated pursuant to detailed and stringent requirements. If FFIN reapplies and is successful in obtaining licensure as a licensed U.S. securities broker-dealer, failure to maintain the required net capital could subject FFIN to suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion from FINRA and other regulatory bodies and ultimately could require the firm\u2019s liquidation.\nIf FFIN reapplies and is successful in becoming a licensed U.S. securities broker-dealer, a change in the nature of its business activities, amendment of the net capital rules, the imposition of new rules, or any unusually large charge against net capital could limit those aspects of FFIN\u2019s contemplated operations that require the intensive use of capital. A significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect FFIN\u2019s ability to operate and/or expand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We cannot assure that FFIN would not fall below minimum net capital requirements in the future.\nWe may not be able to generate positive cash flow and profitability.\nOur ability to generate positive cash flow and profitability depends on our ability to generate and maintain revenue greater than the level of expenses we incur. This depends, among other things, on:\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully pursuing registration of FFIN as a U.S. broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\ncompletion of our proposed acquisitions of Freedom RU and its Kazakhstan broker-dealer subsidiary and Freedom CY;\n\u25cf\nintegration of all of the activities of our combined subsidiaries and the broader development of an integrated, international securities brokerage and investment banking business;\n\u25cf\nsuccessful transition of the customers of the existing broker-dealers we acquire to effecting transactions through our U.S. broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\nmaintenance and increase of our customer base;\n\u25cf\nmanagement of the quality of our services;\n\u25cf\neffective competition with existing and potential competitors;\n\u25cf\nfurther development of our business activities;\n\u25cf\nattraction and retention of qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nability to limit operating costs;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the regulatory regimes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u25cf\nmaintenance of adequate working capital.\nWe may be unable to achieve profitability if we fail to do any of the foregoing. We cannot be certain that we will be able to generate a positive cash flow and profitability in the future. Our inability to generate profitability or positive cash flow could result in disappointing financial results, impede implementation of our growth strategy, or have an adverse impact on the trading price or volume of our common stock. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to generate the cash flow and profits necessary to sustain our business.\nOur financial results may fluctuate substantially from period to period, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nThe Freedom Companies have experienced, and will likely experience in the future, significant periodic variations in revenue and results of operations. We expect the operations of FFIN, if licensed, will fluctuate similarly. These variations may be attributed in part to the fact that such operations are dependent on the vagaries of international economic and political conditions, over which we have no control. As a result, we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.\nOur independent auditor has issued a report questioning our ability to continue as a going concern. This report may impair our ability to raise additional financing and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe report of our independent auditor contained in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 includes a paragraph that explains that we have no continuing operations that result in positive cash flow. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Reports of independent auditors questioning a company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern are generally viewed unfavorably by analysts and investors. This report may make it difficult for us to raise additional financing, if sought, to make an acquisition, or to pursue a new opportunity if one is identified. We urge you to review this report before making any investment decision.\nIt may be difficult for our stockholders to enforce any civil liabilities against us or our officers or directors, because many of our officers and operations are, and are expected to be, outside the United States.\nThe assets of Freedom RU, Freedom KZ, and Freedom CY, which we hope to acquire, are located outside the United States. Several of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, with all or a substantial portion of each person\u2019s assets located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. Further, it may be difficult for investors to enforce in foreign countries judgments obtained in the United States.\nPricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenue and profitability of our brokerage business.\nWe expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from brokerage businesses serving customers in Russia and Kazakhstan. Investing by retail customers, particularly in U.S. securities, is an emerging market in those countries, and we expect to encounter intense price competition in this business as this industry matures with more competitive service providers. We believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas as existing or new competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price or service. In addition, our retail brokerage business will likely face pressure from larger competitors, which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to retail brokerage clients in order to win their trading business. Our inability to compete effectively with our competitors in these areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDifficult market conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways.\nVolatile, down-trending, and negative market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties are likely to adversely affect our business in many ways. Weakness in equity markets and diminished trading volume of securities could adversely impact our brokerage business, from which we expect to derive most of our revenue.\nOur operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail.\nThe international broker-dealer business is highly dependent on processing, on a daily basis, a large number of communications and increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets, in different languages. The financial, accounting, or other data processing systems we, or the firms that clear securities transactions on behalf of our customers, use may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our or our clearing firm\u2019s systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, personnel, or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputation damage.\nWe also face the risk of operational failure of any of the exchanges, depositories, clearing houses, or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and to manage our exposure to risk.\nOur ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities in which we and third parties with which we conduct business are located, including disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation, or other services, whether due to fire, other natural disaster, power or communications failure, act of terrorism, war, or otherwise. When and if our broker-dealer activities become fully operational, we will have employees in Moscow, Russia; Almaty, Kazakhstan; Nicosia, Cyprus; and Salt Lake City, Utah, who will need to work and communicate as an integrated team. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because it may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain of these risks may not cover our losses.\nOur operations will rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. The occurrence of one or more of these events could: (a) jeopardize confidential and other information processed by, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or the computer systems and networks of our customers or other third parties with which we conduct business; or (b) otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or third parties with which we conduct business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nIn addition to the risk of systems failures or interruption from benign but nevertheless disruptive causes, the systems we use and rely on will also be vulnerable to intentional unauthorized access, vandalism, software interruption, data corruption, or other mischief by unauthorized third parties, or \u201chackers.\u201d Such efforts may be directed at us and our business specifically, which might disrupt our operations, or generally to broadly based, international financial, banking, and communications systems, which could disrupt broad segments of the financial and banking systems worldwide. Any such disruptions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur exposure to legal liability is significant, and damages that we may be required to pay and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us could materially adversely affect our businesses.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against broker-dealers and other financial services firms have been increasing. These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities transactions, the suitability of certain investments for specific customers, trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements.\nRisks Related to Owning our Stock\nA significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is owned or controlled by Timur Turlov, whose interests may differ from those of other stockholders.\nTimur Turlov, our chairman and chief executive officer, owns approximately 80.1% of our outstanding common stock, which could increase to as high as 95% as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement. Therefore, Mr. Turlov will be able to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the approval of our proposed recapitalization, and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of us.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without approval from our stockholders. This means that our board of directors has the right, without stockholder approval, to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock. This could affect the rights of our common stockholders regarding, among other things, dividends and liquidation. We could also use the preferred stock to deter or delay a change in control of our Company that may be opposed by our management, even if the transaction might be favorable to our common stockholders.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink market our stock trades sporadically with limited volume. We cannot assure that a more active trading market will develop even if FFIN becomes licensed as a U.S. broker-dealer and all proposed acquisitions are completed. Accordingly, our stockholders may not be able to sell our shares when they want or at the price they want.\nPenny stock regulations will impose certain restrictions on resales of our securities, which may cause an investor to lose some or all of its investment.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share that is not traded on a national securities exchange or that has an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. As a result, our common stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction before the purchase. Further, if the price of the stock is below $5.00 per share and the issuer does not have $2.0 million or more net tangible assets or is not listed on a registered national securities exchange, sales of such stock in the secondary trading market are subject to certain additional rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules generally require, among other things, that brokers engaged in secondary trading of penny stocks provide customers with written disclosure documents, monthly statements of the market value of penny stocks, disclosure of the bid and asked prices, and disclosure of the compensation to the broker-dealer and the salesperson working for the broker-dealer in connection with the transaction. These rules and regulations may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock, thereby effectively limiting the liquidity of our common stock. These rules may also adversely affect the ability of persons that acquire our common stock to resell their securities in any trading market that may exist at the time of an intended sale.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Section 12 of the Exchange Act. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation, and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year when the aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and nonvoting common equity held by our nonaffiliates is $75 million or more on the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, but less than $700 million. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to fund the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our stockholders must rely on sales of their shares of common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on an investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91437, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "FRHC"}
