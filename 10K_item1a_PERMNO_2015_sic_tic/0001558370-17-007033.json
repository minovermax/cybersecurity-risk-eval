{"cik": "1136294", "company": "GLOBAL POWER EQUIPMENT GROUP INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIf we do not timely pay amounts due and comply with the covenants under our credit facilities, our business, financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern would be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We incurred net losses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 and expect to incur further net losses in the operation of our businesses. Prior to May 2015, we were dependent on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as a source of funding our operations. However, coincident with our announcement in May 2015 that we would have to restate our previously filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and would not be able to file our first quarter 2015 Form 10-Q in a timely manner, we were no longer in compliance with various covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, we were unable to make incremental borrowings against the Revolving Credit Facility after that time and operated under a series of waivers of default under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, beginning on July 22, 2016, the administrative agent under our Revolving Credit Facility exercised rights that enabled it to control rights over certain of our accounts by implementing a cash dominion process to use receipts of collateral to directly pay down debt, while allowing us to borrow subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2016, we had $2.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $45.3 million due on our Revolving Credit Facility, with $6.5 million available borrowing capacity.\nIn June 2017, Centre Lane acquired the debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We subsequently completed a refinancing process and entered into a 4.5-year senior secured term loan (the \u201cInitial Centre Lane Facility\u201d) with an affiliate of Centre Lane. We entered into a first amendment to the senior secured term loan (the \u201cCentre Lane Amendment\u201d and, together with the Initial Centre Lane Facility, the \u201cCentre Lane Facility\u201d) in August 2017, which provided for a first-out term loan, which matures in September 2018. We used the proceeds from the Initial Centre Lane Facility to repay the full balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The terms of the Centre Lane Facility are less favorable to us than the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, and, among other things, require higher interest payments and subject us to restrictive covenants that significantly limit our operating flexibility and encumber our assets. Any default on the Centre Lane Facility could result in the outstanding principal balance under such facility becoming immediately due and payable. We do not currently have sufficient cash on hand to repay the balance, and a failure to do so would constitute a default.\nUpon a default under the Centre Lane Facility, our senior secured lenders would have the right to accelerate the then-outstanding amounts under such facility and to exercise their rights and remedies to collect such amounts, which would include foreclosing on collateral constituting substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, a default could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our lenders under the Centre Lane Facility exercise their rights and remedies to the extent permitted by such facility and applicable law, we would likely be forced to seek bankruptcy protection and our investors could lose the full value of their investment in our common stock.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, to meet the covenants of the Centre Lane Facility and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 11-Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash resources to continue funding our operations.\nIn order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations and continue as a going concern, we will likely need to successfully implement one or more of the following initiatives: raise additional equity or debt capital; or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business. If we are unsuccessful in these liquidity generating initiatives and do not have sufficient cash resources to operate our business, we may be forced to significantly curtail or cease our operations or seek bankruptcy protection. For additional information, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 11-Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may include an explanatory paragraph in its audit opinion that accompanies our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 indicating that our debt maturity and liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn June 2017, Centre Lane acquired the debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and we repaid the full outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility and entered into the Initial Centre Lane Facility, as amended in August 2017. If we are unable to pay amounts due under the Centre Lane Facility, fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants under the Centre Lane Facility or otherwise breach or fail to develop and implement plans sufficient to alleviate the adverse effects of the foregoing before the completion of the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm may include an explanatory paragraph in its audit opinion that accompanies our 2017 financial statements, indicating that the terms of our indebtedness and related liquidity position raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe presence of any such explanatory paragraph may, among other negative effects, make it difficult for us to continue to negotiate acceptable payment terms with our vendors and customers or may result in one or more of our suppliers making demand for adequate assurance, which could include a demand for payment in advance. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable payment terms with our customers, or if any of our material suppliers were to successfully demand payment in advance, and we were unable to internally generate or externally raise cash in sufficient amounts to cover our resulting reduced liquidity, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and may force us to seek bankruptcy protection. Other effects of such an explanatory paragraph may include difficulty obtaining future financing and negative perceptions among our customers and employees.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm fails to stand for reappointment, any resulting need to engage a new auditor could significantly delay the filing of our future annual and quarterly reports with the SEC and adversely impact our business.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm goes through client reacceptance procedures annually to determine if they are willing to stand for reappointment. These procedures include, among other items, a risk assessment. Due to our risk profile, there is a chance we will not meet their minimum criteria for reacceptance. If we are unable to satisfy the requirements of those client reacceptance criteria, we may be required to change auditors, which could significantly delay the filing with the SEC of our 2017 annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K or 10-Q, as applicable, and subsequent reports. Any such delay could result in a breach of the covenants in the Centre Lane Credit Agreement, reduce our trade credit based on our inability to deliver recent financial statements to our key vendors and delay our ability to become current in our SEC filings.\nThe limitations and covenants contained in the Centre Lane Facility constrain our ability to borrow additional money, sell assets and make acquisitions, which may impair our ability to fully implement elements of our business strategy and otherwise adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Centre Lane Facility contains a number of limitations and covenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7\nborrow money or make capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nmerge or sell assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nmake acquisitions or investments.\nThe Centre Lane Facility provides for variable rates of interest. We will be liable for the greatest amount of interest permitted under such rates. Any increase in the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may result in an increase in our interest rates on our outstanding debt and therefore negatively affect our cash flow and financial condition. Our obligations\nunder the Centre Lane Facility are guaranteed by all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. Our obligations are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our assets and those of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. This includes 100% of the voting equity interests of our domestic subsidiaries and certain specified foreign subsidiaries and 65% of the voting equity interests of other directly owned foreign subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions.\nThe Centre Lane Facility also includes additional restrictive covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios beginning September 30, 2018. These restrictions could adversely affect our business because they include, among other things, limitations on our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be beneficial for our business. These restrictions also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make capital expenditures and business acquisitions, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, accept certain business opportunities from customers or seek additional capital.\nIf we do not comply with the restrictive covenants, including failing to satisfy the required financial ratios, or obtain waivers as needed, our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our assets, and our shareholders may lose the full value of an investment in our common stock. Our ability to comply with the restrictive covenants in the Centre Lane Facility depends upon our ability to generate adequate earnings and operating cash flows or sell assets, which will be subject to our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as other general economic and competition conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure investors that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations, and we may, in the future, face significant liquidity constraints. For additional information, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 11-Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nIf we become unable to obtain adequate surety bonding, it could reduce our ability to bid on new work, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects.\nIn line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers. These bonds provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. If security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond or letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us, we may not be able to pursue that project. In addition, bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost. Our ability to obtain surety bonds is currently constrained, and any continued inability to obtain surety bonds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and business prospects.\nWe are currently unable to obtain letters of credit, which could reduce our ability to bid on new work, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects.\nIn line with industry practice, we are often required to provide letters of credit. These letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. The Centre Lane Facility does not provide letters of credit. If security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond or letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us, we may not be able to pursue that project. Any continued inability to obtain surety bonds and letters of credit on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and business prospects.\nWe have recorded write-downs of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets. If we were required to write-down additional amounts, our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment at least annually in accordance with GAAP. As a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2016, we determined that the fair value of our reporting units each exceeded their respective book values, and, accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2016. During 2015, our common stock traded at a market price that was lower than its book value for a prolonged period. As a result of this impairment indicator, we recorded a non-cash charge of $47.2 million for the impairment of goodwill and trade names in the third quarter of 2015. We had $51.0 million of goodwill and trade names remaining on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. If we experience declines in revenue and gross profit or do not meet our current and forecasted operating budget, we may be subject to additional goodwill and/or other intangible asset impairments in the future. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, and based on the magnitude of historical impairment charges, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect\non our financial results. For additional information, see \u201cNote 7-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges to tax regulations, laws, accounting principles, future business operations or examinations by tax authorities can adversely impact our provision for income taxes and ability to use deferred tax assets.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings differing materially from our projections, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, expiration of or lapses in tax credits, changes in ownership as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and outcomes as a result of tax examinations or changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles. As a result, our income tax provisions are also subject to volatility from these changes, as well as changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretations thereof.\nFor instance, on December 31, 2014, we recorded $44.9 million of non-cash valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets recorded in 2014 and prior years. We also recorded $16.9 million and $21.9 million of additional valuation allowances on substantially all U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These deferred tax assets remain available for use in future periods and will reduce our current tax expense in the year in which taxable income is generated to the extent that the deferred tax assets are not eliminated or limited under Code Sections 382 and 383.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in GAAP related to accounting for income taxes. In addition, GAAP applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which, if settled unfavorably, could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital. We could also be subject to examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There may be exposure that the outcomes from these examinations will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be subject to limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have U.S. federal tax NOL carryforwards, foreign tax credits and general business tax credits of $157.9 million, $9.6 million and $0.4 million respectively. Generally, NOL, foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce or eliminate U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Section 382 of the Code limits a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to reduce tax liabilities if the corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change.\u201d For these purposes, an ownership change is deemed to occur if there has been a change of more than 50% in the ownership of shareholders owning 5% or greater of the value of a corporation\u2019s stock over a three year period. Code Section 383 applies the same limitations to foreign tax credit, general business credit and capital loss carryforwards after an ownership change.\nBased upon our review of the issue, we have not experienced an ownership change as defined under Code Section 382 as of December 31, 2016. If additional equity is issued in the future, an ownership change pursuant to Code Section 382 may occur. In addition, an ownership change under Code Section 382 could be caused by circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as market purchases or sales by certain 5% or greater shareholders of our stock. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change which would significantly limit the utilization of the Company\u2019s NOL, foreign tax credit or general business credit carryforwards in calculating future federal tax liabilities.\nWe have incurred losses from operations in recent fiscal years, expect to incur further losses in the next several years and may not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability.\nWe incurred net losses in 2016, 2015 and 2014, and we expect to incur further net losses in the operation of our business. We incurred significant expenses during 2016 and 2015 related to, among other things, legal and accounting costs associated with the restatement of certain prior financial results. We have incurred, and are likely to continue to incur, additional costs for legal proceedings associated with the restatement. In addition, during 2014, we entered into an agreement to fulfill a project with a partner, whereby we were jointly and severally liable for the entire project. The project had certain liquidated damage clauses, including a clause that allows the customer the right to be made whole should the product not\nmeet certain criteria. This can include a complete rebuild of the project. Although there is a wide range of potential liability, we accrued $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See \u201cNote 15-Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. Investors should not consider our historical operating results as indicative of future operating results.\nIn addition, our Electrical Solutions segment may incur losses resulting from Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The hurricane significantly impacted production at our Koontz-Wagner facility in Houston, Texas, which was almost completely shut down for nearly one week. Although work has resumed at that facility, we could incur substantial losses due to production delays, which are described in more detail below.\nIn addition, to become and remain profitable, we must successfully generate revenue, which requires us to, among other things, increase our cash flows from operations. A lack of capital resulting from any inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our business and service our indebtedness would negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf our profits do not increase to offset these increases in costs, our operating results will be adversely affected. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nAny inability to finance our business or repay the Centre Lane Facility, including due to deterioration of the credit markets, could adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to finance our existing operations and initiatives with existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash flows from operations and the Centre Lane Facility. In June 2017, we repaid the balance due under the Revolving Credit Facility; however, the Centre Lane Facility contains high interest rate payments, a number of restrictive covenants and other terms that limit our operating flexibility, including our ability to enter other investments or new lines of business. In addition, deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect the ability of many of our customers to pay us on time and the ability of many of our suppliers to meet our needs on a competitive basis. Any inability to pay amounts due under the Centre Lane Facility or access necessary additional funds on acceptable terms or at all may negatively impact our business or operations.\nWe are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Portions of our operations are located in foreign jurisdictions and a portion of our billings is paid in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could therefore cause fluctuations in revenue derived from foreign operations. For example, many foreign currencies have decreased in value against the U.S. dollar. Our receipt of such devalued foreign currencies for a project as to which a significant portion of our costs are incurred in U.S. dollars would adversely affect our revenue, as expressed in U.S. dollars, and our profit from that project. In addition, sales of products and services are affected by the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. Changes in foreign currency rates can also affect the costs of our products purchased or manufactured outside the U.S. Changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nRisk Factors Related to the Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements and Our Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAudit, investigation, legal and expert services regarding the restatement and audit of our historical financial results, as well as recent legal proceedings, have required substantial attention from the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d), have diverted financial resources away from the Company and management\u2019s attention away from our usual business operations and may continue to adversely affect customer relationships and overall business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Board, Audit Committee and members of management have devoted and expect to continue to devote substantial internal and external resources to legal matters resulting from the restatement and remediation efforts, the preparation and filing of this Form 10-K and the preparation and filing of future periodic reports. As a result of these efforts, we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant incremental fees and expenses for additional audit services, financial and other consulting services and legal services, as well as the implementation and maintenance of systems and processes that will need to be updated, supplemented or replaced. These expenses, as well as the substantial time devoted\nby our Board and management toward identifying, addressing and remediating any internal weaknesses and legal costs related to our internal investigation and the ongoing SEC investigation, pending litigation and other actions related to the restatement, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future inquiries from legal proceedings or other actions by the SEC as a result of the restatement of our historical financial statements will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our resources in addition to those resources already consumed in connection with the restatement itself and ongoing litigation matters. In addition, the restatement of our historical financial statements, delisting of our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and constrained liquidity have hindered our ability to attract new customers and strained relationships with certain existing customers, making it challenging to increase the volume and scope of our work.\nA pending putative securities class action, as well as an ongoing SEC investigation, could divert management\u2019s focus, result in substantial expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe matters that led to our internal investigation and the restatement of our historical financial results expose us to greater than typical risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. For instance, a putative shareholder class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with matters related to the restatement of our financial results. The second consolidated amended complaint filed by the lead plaintiff names the Company and three of our former officers as defendants. Please see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cNote 15-Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit, the magnitude of any potential losses or the effect such litigation may have on us or our operations. Regardless of the outcome, lawsuits and investigations involving us, or our current or former officers and directors, could result in significant expenses and divert attention and resources of our management and other key employees. We could be required to pay damages or other penalties or have injunctions or other equitable remedies imposed against us or our current or former directors and officers. In addition, we are generally obligated to indemnify our current and former directors and officers in connection with lawsuits, governmental investigations and related litigation or settlement amounts. Such amounts could exceed the coverage provided under our insurance policies. Any of these factors could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC is conducting a formal investigation into possible securities law violations by us relating to our disclosures concerning certain financial information, including our cost of sales and revenue recognition, as well as related accounting issues. We are cooperating with the SEC in its investigation. Please see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d At this time, we cannot predict the outcome or the duration of the SEC investigation or any other legal proceedings or any enforcement actions or other remedies that may be imposed on us as a result of the SEC investigation. Any action by the SEC could result in sanctions against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. A protracted investigation could impose substantial additional costs and distractions, regardless of its outcome. Furthermore, publicity surrounding the foregoing or any enforcement actions resulting from the SEC\u2019s investigation, even if ultimately resolved favorably for us, could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). In connection with our internal investigation and the restatement, we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control environment and internal control activities. As of December 31, 2016, these material weaknesses continued to exist. We therefore concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Until we fully remediate these deficiencies, it may be more difficult for us to report results accurately and on time. While we are working to address the internal control over financial reporting and other issues raised by our restatement process, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. As of the date of this filing, the remediation process is ongoing. See \u201cPart II-Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\u201d and \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur undetected, and it is possible that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure of our internal controls could result in additional material\nmisstatements in our consolidated financial statements, significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, costs, failure to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations and a loss of investor confidence. It would also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. If our internal controls are deemed inadequate in the future, our current external auditors could resign, and the process of retaining new auditors could limit our access to capital for an extended period of time.\nOur failure to implement new accounting standards during the required time periods could result in our inability to file future periodic reports in a timely manner and lead to additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, beyond those disclosed in this report.\nThe FASB has issued new accounting guidance on revenue recognition that will change both the way revenue is accounted for and disclosed and will result in changes in internal controls. These changes in internal controls will reach beyond finance and accounting and will have an impact on other areas of our business, such as information technology and operations. Due to the delay in filing our 2015 Report and this Form 10-K, we have recently begun assessing the standard and its impact on our financial statement reporting and operations. Although we have begun initial discussions with external resources to assist us in our implementation, at this time, we are unable to determine how long the assessment and implementation will take to complete.\nOur business operations depend upon our new senior management team and the ability of our other employees to successfully perform their roles.\nWe have experienced significant turnover in our senior management in recent years. In March 2015, we announced the departure of our former President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and the appointment of Terence J. Cryan as our new President and CEO. In September 2015, we announced the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer and the appointment of Craig E. Holmes as Senior Vice President of Finance. In March 2017, we announced the retirement of Timothy M. Howsman, who served as our Principal Financial Officer, the subsequent appointment of Mr. Holmes as the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial Officer and the appointment of Mark F. Jolly, who had been serving as Vice President Finance, as the Company\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer and Principal Accounting Officer. In July 2017, we announced the resignation of Mr. Cryan as our President and CEO and the appointment of Mr. Holmes and Tracy D. Pagliara, formerly our Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, as Co-Presidents and Co-CEOs. Charles E. Wheelock was simultaneously appointed Vice President, Administration, General Counsel and Secretary. In August 2017, we announced the cessation of Mr. Jolly\u2019s employment as our Chief Accounting Officer and Principal Accounting Officer and the appointment of Erin Gonzalez as our Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer. In addition, we have had significant turnover of management and other personnel in our domestic Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments.\nWe have made significant changes to our business in a short interval of time, which can be disruptive to our employees and business, and may add to the risk of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation of our internal controls over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Changes to company strategy can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nAs new employees gain experience in their roles, we could experience inefficiencies or a lack of business continuity due to loss of historical knowledge and a lack of familiarity of those employees with business processes, operating requirements, policies and procedures (some of which are new) and key information technologies and related infrastructure used in our day-to-day operations and financial reporting. It is important to our success that these key employees quickly adapt to, and excel in, their new roles. Their failure to do so could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs that could adversely impact our results of operations, our stock price and our customer relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, if we were to lose the services of any one or more key employees, whether due to death, disability or termination of employment, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, financial plans and other objectives could be significantly impaired. Any of the above factors could also impede our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal controls. See \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d If we do not effectively manage our business through these management transitions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of our inability to prepare and timely file periodic reports, we face limitations in our ability to issue securities and engage in certain transactions, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to comply with Section 13 of the Exchange Act. We did not file any Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or any Annual Report on Form 10-K from the May 2015 announcement of our intention to restate our financial results until March 15, 2017, when we filed the 2015 Report, which restated our prior period financial statements and provided our 2015 financial information. Even after the filing of this Form 10-K, we will remain delinquent in our SEC reporting obligations because we have not filed any of our periodic reports for our 2017 quarterly periods. We will not be eligible to use \u201cshort form\u201d registration statements that would allow us to incorporate by reference our SEC reports into our registration statements, or to use \u201cshelf\u201d registration statements, until we have filed all of our periodic reports in a timely manner for a period of 12 months. After we become current in our SEC filing obligations, we may use Form S-1 to register a sale of our stock to raise capital. However, such registration statement cannot be used until we are current in our disclosure obligations, and even then, would likely increase transaction costs and be time consuming, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital in a timely manner. Our failure to remain current in our SEC reporting obligations has resulted in our inability to permit use of our existing registration statement on Form S-8 or file a new registration statement on Form S-8, which would be used to register the issuance and sales of securities under our equity incentive plans. As a result, our ability to grant awards to adequately incentivize and retain skilled employees, including key employees needed to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses in our internal controls, could be adversely affected. See \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d In addition, delays in filing our periodic reports may impact our ability to solicit shareholder consent for certain potential capital-raising transactions. These restrictions could increase the costs of selling securities publicly, significantly delay such sales or transactions and adversely affect our business.\nWe have not held an annual meeting of our shareholders since May 2015. As a result, our shareholders have not had the opportunity to elect directors since May 2015, and we cannot assure investors when such an opportunity will arise.\nOur bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law state that we must hold an annual meeting of our shareholders for the election of directors and other business as may be properly brought before the meeting. However, because of our delayed periodic report filings, we have not held an annual meeting of our shareholders since May 2015. Therefore, our shareholders have not had the opportunity to vote in an election of our directors since that time. We plan to hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting after we become current in our SEC reporting obligations; however, if we do not become current in our SEC reporting obligations, or if we otherwise fail to hold annual shareholders\u2019 meetings in the future, it may be more challenging for our shareholders to vote on the election of our directors.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations\nA substantial portion of the revenue from our Services segment is related to services performed at nuclear power plants, and reduced investment in or increased regulation related to nuclear power plants would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe demand for the services provided at nuclear power plants by our Services segment is directly tied to the number of nuclear power facilities that utilize our Services segment. Additionally, U.S. nuclear capacity and electricity generation are expected to decline due to continuing low natural gas prices and the rapid expansion of low cost renewable energy and new technologies in the U.S., displacing more traditional sources of power, including nuclear power. Public support for nuclear power has also softened because of pricing, environmental and safety concerns. Declining demand for U.S. nuclear power generation and related construction and maintenance budgets would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and cash flow.\nVery few new nuclear reactors are under construction in the U.S., and several nuclear reactors are undergoing decommissioning. Pricing pressure has resulted in a decrease in the maintenance budgets for existing nuclear plants. Other new construction projects are being discontinued or reevaluated. For example, in July 2017, the owners of V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina seeking approval of an abandonment plan of such units. Although they later voluntarily withdrew the petition, they expressed uncertainty as to whether they could recover their costs for the new units, and the ultimate fate of the project is unclear.\nIn addition, decreases in state and federal government subsidies and increased regulation would also negatively impact the demand for nuclear power and the services we provide. For instance, the NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose safety-related and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, and events at\nnuclear facilities or other events impacting the industry generally could lead to additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities and could negatively impact the demand for nuclear power and the services we provide.\nIf our costs exceed the estimates we use to set the fixed-prices of our contracts, our earnings will be reduced.\nThe contracts under which we sell our products are generally fixed-price contracts, most of which are \u201clump sum bid\u201d contracts. Fixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, erroneous or incomplete cost estimates, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period.\nIn addition, we have a limited ability to recover any cost overruns. Contract prices are established based in part on our projected costs, which are subject to a number of assumptions. The costs that we incur in connection with each contract can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections. Because of the large scale and complexity of our contracts, unanticipated changes may occur, such as customer budget decisions, design changes, delays in receiving permits and cost increases, as well as delays of drawings and equipment in delivery of our products. Unanticipated cost increases or delays may occur as a result of several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nincreases in the cost of commodities (primarily steel plate), labor or freight;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated technical problems (for example, difficulties in designing products that integrate well with new generations of gas turbines);\n\u00b7\nsuppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 failure to perform (for example, substandard welding by a subcontractor), requiring modified execution plans or re-work; and\n\u00b7\ndecreases in labor efficiency realized.\nWe often are contractually subject to liquidated damages or late delivery fees in the event that we fail to perform our obligations in a timely manner. Such damages or fees can be significant and may have a negative impact on our profit margins and financial results.\nCost increases or overruns that we cannot pass on to our customers or our payment of liquidated damages or other penalties under our contracts will lower our earnings. In addition, increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our gross margins.\nIf we are unable to control the quality or timely production of products manufactured or services provided because of internal operational issues or poor subcontractor performances, our reputation could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers. In the event of subcontractor insolvency, if we are unable to recover any advance progress payments made to subcontractors, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on subcontractors to manufacture and assemble a substantial portion of our products and services. Our subcontractors account for a significant percentage of our manufacturing and service costs. The quality and performance of our subcontractors is not entirely under our control. Our subcontractors may not always meet the requisite level of quality control or our delivery schedules. The failure of our subcontractors to produce quality products or perform quality services in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in the cancellation of orders for our products, significant warranty and repair costs and the loss of customers. In addition, our contracts with customers may contain liquidated damages or late delivery fees, and triggering such provisions could result in significant financial penalties, or, even if not triggered, could affect our ability to recognize revenue in a given period. Due to on going operational adjustments, we currently have several projects in the Electrical Solutions segment that may result in significant claims under such provisions.\nOther potential consequences of the failure of our subcontractors to meet our standards include a potential need to move subcontract manufacturing to other vendors in different locations, resulting in increased costs. We also make advance progress payments to subcontractors in anticipation of their completion of our orders and may be unable to recover those advances if a subcontractor fails to complete an order. The occurrence of any of the above may adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters, including hurricanes, and other severe catastrophic events, such as acts of war and terrorism, and any disruption to our business resulting from natural disasters will adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe catastrophic events. Any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and provide products and services to our customers, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other catastrophic events.\nMost recently, our Koontz-Wagner operations in Houston, Texas were impacted by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The severe weather conditions directly affected production at that facility, which was largely shut down for nearly one week. Although work has resumed at that facility, the hurricane resulted in significant production delays, and we are currently assessing the impact this will have on our contractual obligations to certain customers. Should the impact result in delivery delays, this could result in liquidated damages to be assessed or the potential loss of customers. In addition, many of our employees have been displaced by the hurricane or have departed to assist with the hurricane recovery efforts. At this time, we do not know when we will have a full staff.\nWe may declare the existence of a force majeure event under our contracts with certain customers, but we could incur liabilities for failure to meet the requirements of those agreements, especially if the counterparties dispute our invocation of the force majeure provisions of those agreements.\nIt will be several weeks or months before we are able to fully assess the extent of the damage and the implications to our business. Currently, there is uncertainty as to the magnitude of the losses associated with this event and whether such losses would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThese and any future disruptions to our operations, including acts of war, terrorism or other force majeure, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Some of our competitors and potential competitors are less leveraged than we are, have greater financial or other resources than we have and may be better able to withstand adverse market conditions within the industry. Our competitors typically compete aggressively on the basis of pricing, and such competition may continue to impact our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain the rates we charge. To the extent that we choose to match our competitors\u2019 prices, it would result in lower margins and, as a result, could harm our results of operations. Should we choose not to match, or remain within a reasonable competitive distance from, our competitors\u2019 pricing, we may face a loss of sales volume and, as a result, such decision could harm our results of operations. In addition, our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in our markets that may be adopted by our competitors, as well as our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market new and improved products in a changing environment. However, any such developments would likely require additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A failure to keep pace with our competitors or the technological innovations in the markets we serve could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected by risks associated with the energy and power generation industries, such as price and supply and demand fluctuations for oil and natural gas.\nOur Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments are exposed to risks associated with the use of natural gas and oil as energy sources. These risks, which are not subject to our control, include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, the lower demand for power generation from natural gas, a slowdown in the construction of oil and gas infrastructure, a general softening of the downstream industry and a slowdown in the discovery or development of natural gas and/or oil reserves. While higher natural gas and oil prices generally result in increased infrastructure spending by customers in our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments, sustained high energy prices could be an impediment to economic growth and could result in reduced infrastructure spending by such customers. Higher prices could also decrease spending on power generation equipment and related infrastructure, an important component to the success of our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments. Further, if the discovery or development of natural gas and/or oil reserves slows or stops, customers would likely reduce capital spending on mainline pipe, gas gathering and compressor systems and other related infrastructure, resulting in less demand for the portfolio of products of our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions\nsegments. If the profitability of those segments were to decline, our overall profitability, results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected. The significant increase in the North American supply of natural gas due to ongoing development of unconventional shale formations has also resulted in low natural gas prices for the past several years. Lower natural gas and oil prices sometimes result in decreased spending by certain customers in our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments, which could likewise adversely affect our overall profitability, results of operations and cash flows. Our Services segment is also sensitive to the price of natural gas. Low natural gas prices mean gas-fired power generation is more competitive with coal and nuclear power generation, resulting in reduced spending by those customers.\nOur future revenue and operating results may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period.\nOur quarterly and annual revenue and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. Our product sales contracts contain customer-specific delivery terms that, coupled with other factors beyond our control, may result in uneven recognition of revenue and earnings over time. Customer-imposed delays and changes to billing terms can significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition and lengthen our cash conversion cycle. Due to our relatively large average contract size, our product sales volume during any given period may be concentrated in relatively few orders, intensifying the magnitude of these fluctuations. Furthermore, some of our operating costs are fixed. As a result, we may have limited ability to reduce our operating costs in response to unanticipated decreases in our revenue or the demand for our products in any given reporting period. Therefore, our operating results in any reporting period may not be indicative of our future performance. Because we must make significant estimates related to potential costs when we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis, these costs may change significantly from reporting period to reporting period based on new project information. In addition, most of our product revenue is based on fixed-price contracts, and the relative profitability can vary significantly between contracts. As a result, our profitability can vary from reporting period to reporting period based on the specific contract mix.\nWe may not be able to maintain or expand our business outside of the U.S. due to numerous factors outside our control.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S., including:\n\u00b7\nlabor unrest;\n\u00b7\nregional economic uncertainty;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability, including unrest in the Middle East;\n\u00b7\nrelations between the U.S., China and Russia;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nexport duties and quotas;\n\u00b7\nexpropriations;\n\u00b7\nU.S. and international customs, tariffs and other regulations;\n\u00b7\ncurrent and changing regulatory environments;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7\navailability of financing;\n\u00b7\nunfavorable commercial terms and conditions; and\n\u00b7\npotential for adverse dispute resolution outcomes.\nThese factors may impact our ability to meet product delivery commitments in foreign countries that could result in a decline in revenue or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our business outside the U.S.\nWe conduct our operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the U.S.\nWe have manufacturing subcontractors in many areas outside of the U.S., including China, South Korea, Indonesia, Poland, the Middle East and Mexico, and increasing our manufacturing footprint to localize in emerging markets is an important element of our strategy. There are a number of risks associated with doing business internationally, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nexposure to local economic and political conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of social unrest, such as risks of terrorism or other hostilities;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;\n\u00b7\nexport and import restrictions; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential for shortages of trained labor.\nIn particular, there has been social unrest in the Middle East and Mexico, and any increased violence in or around our subcontractors\u2019 manufacturing facilities could impact our business by disrupting our supply chain and the delivery of products to customers.\nIn addition, the increased violence in or around our subcontractors\u2019 manufacturing facilities could present several risks to employees who may be directly affected by the violence, and such violence may result in a decision by them to relocate from the area or may make it difficult for us or our subcontractors, to recruit or retain talented employees. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effects are unpredictable and vary from country to country. Any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our financial results.\nA material portion of our revenue is from sales of equipment for gas turbine power plants. During periods of declining construction of new gas turbine power plants, the market for our products is significantly diminished.\nThe demand for our products depends on the continued construction of gas turbine power generation plants. The power generation equipment industry has experienced cyclical periods of slow growth or decline. During periods of decreased demand for new gas turbine power plants, our customers may be more likely to decrease expenditures on the types of products and systems that we supply and, as a result, our future revenue may decrease. These projects typically require funding from a healthy credit market as well. If credit markets are tight, funding could be difficult to obtain, therefore delaying or even cancelling these types of projects entirely. Because our growth strategy includes focusing on the natural gas growth trend, a rise in the price or a shortage in the supply of natural gas could affect the profitability, or operations, of gas turbine power plants, which could adversely affect our future revenue. These and other factors may temper demand for our products. If prices of natural gas in a particular geographic area are so high, or the supply of natural gas is so limited, as to make the construction of new gas turbine power plants or oil and gas infrastructure uneconomical in that geographic area, we may not derive any future revenue from projects in that geographic region unless and until those factors are reversed.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations have played a part in the increased use of gas turbine technology in various jurisdictions. These laws and regulations may change, or other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations. Changes in existing laws and regulations could result in a reduction in the building and refurbishment of gas turbine power plants or oil and gas infrastructures. In addition, stricter environmental regulation could result in our customers seeking new ways of generating electricity that do not require the use of our products. Policymakers continue to focus on emissions from gas turbine power plants, and attempts to reduce or regulate emissions could increase the cost of gas turbine power plants and result in our customers switching to alternative sources of power.\nOther current power technologies, improvements to these technologies and new alternative power technologies that compete or may compete in the future with gas turbine power plants could affect our sales and profitability. Any change in the power generation industry that results in a decline in the construction of new power plants or a decline in the upgrading of existing power plants could materially adversely affect our sales.\nA small number of major customers account for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of these customers could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. In 2016, three customers accounted for 43.0% of our consolidated revenue. In 2015, four customers accounted for 61.6% of our consolidated revenue. In 2014, four customers accounted for 58.4% of our consolidated revenue. For a listing of our major customers, see \u201cNote 16-Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. Because our major customers represent a large part of our business, the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Several of our customers have the ability to internally source some of the products we manufacture. Any increase in this activity could reduce our sales. Our business volume with each of our largest customers is highly dependent on power generation capacity additions for our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments and on operations and maintenance budgets for U.S. utilities for our Services segment. Fluctuations in any of these factors could materially adversely impact our performance results.\nWe are subject to potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties, including our customers and suppliers.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods, or who purchase products and services from us, will be unable to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. If such third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us, or we may have to write off receivables in the case of a customer failing to pay.\nIf a customer becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover accounts receivable from that customer would be adversely affected and any payment we received during the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy estate. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nIn March 2017, Westinghouse, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corporation, filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of December 31, 2016, our accounts receivable from Westinghouse was $4.7 million. As of the bankruptcy filing date, we had $8.7 million of accounts receivable from Westinghouse, none of which has been collected. Westinghouse has stated that it intends to continue normal business operations. However, a number of uncertainties surround the Westinghouse Chapter 11 proceedings. We could be adversely affected if the owner of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 decides to discontinue construction of this plant resulting from construction delays or cost overruns resulting from the Westinghouse bankruptcy filing. The owners of V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 initially filed an abandonment plan to cease construction of such units; however, the owners later voluntarily withdrew this petition.\nThe dollar amount of our backlog, as stated at any time, is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.\nOur backlog consists of firm orders or blanket authorizations from our customers. Backlog may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period due to the timing of customer commitments. The time between receipt of an order and actual completion, or delivery, of our products varies from a few weeks, in the case of inventoried precision parts, to a year or more, in the case of custom-designed gas turbine products, SCR systems and other major plant components. However, backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by our customers. To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be affected. If a customer cancels an order, we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. Typically, however, we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog contracts in the event of cancellation. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Furthermore, a portion of our backlog for multi-year service maintenance contracts is based on what we expect to perform in the next twelve months of work and is therefore not necessarily supported by a firm purchase order. If that work does not materialize, then our backlog would be negatively impacted, as that work would be considered a \u201ccancellation.\u201d Revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays. Fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog. Because of these large orders, our backlog in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods. Our backlog, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue or of long-term industry trends.\nThe success of our Services segment is partially dependent upon maintaining our safety record, and an injury to or death of one of our employees could result in material liabilities to our company.\nThe activities we conduct at our and our customers\u2019 facilities present a risk of injury or death to our employees, customers or visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with safety regulations. We may be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death, and our workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance policies may not be adequate or may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us. In addition, our ability to obtain new business and retain our current business, particularly in our Services segment, is partially dependent on our continuing ability to maintain a safety record that exceeds the industry average. If we fail to maintain superior safety performance, or if serious accidents occur in spite of our safety procedures, our revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in our credit profile and market conditions can affect our relationships with suppliers, vendors and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on third-party suppliers and vendors to obtain necessary materials, and on subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing and services. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier, vendor or subcontractor, any substantial limitation on the availability of or deterioration in our relationship with required suppliers or subcontractors would negatively impact our operations.\nChanges in our credit profile can affect the way such third parties view our ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices or require credit enhancement. For instance, as a result of delays in our payments, certain suppliers and subcontractors have imposed less favorable payment terms on us, including requirements to provide them with additional security in the form of prepayments, surety bonds or letters of credit. The imposition of burdensome payment terms or collateral requirements could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to other parties. This in turn could cause us to be unable to operate our business at the desired productivity levels, which might adversely affect our profitability and cash flow. In other cases, our relationships with certain third parties have been terminated, requiring us to rely on new firms for certain products and services, which may cost more and be of inferior quality.\nIn addition, changes in market and economic conditions could increase the risk of a lack of available suppliers or subcontractors. If any supplier or subcontractor upon which we rely is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations under present or future agreements with us, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain necessary products or services and may suffer an interruption in our ability to provide our services and products to customers.\nTo the extent we cannot engage quality subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials on acceptable terms, we would not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur former operating unit has been named as a defendant in asbestos personal injury lawsuits.\nAs discussed in \u201cNote 15-Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, our former operating unit has been named as a defendant in a limited number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits. Neither we, nor our predecessors, ever mined, manufactured, produced or distributed asbestos fiber, the material that allegedly caused the injury underlying these actions. The bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge order issued upon our emergence from bankruptcy extinguished the claims made by all plaintiffs who had filed asbestos claims against us before that time. We believe the bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge order should serve as a bar against any later claim filed against us, including any of our subsidiaries, based on alleged injury from asbestos at any time before our emergence from bankruptcy. In all of the asbestos cases finalized post-bankruptcy, we have been successful in having such claims dismissed without liability. Moreover, during 2012, we secured insurance coverage that will help to reimburse the defense costs and potential indemnity obligations of our former operating unit relating to these claims. Nonetheless, findings of liability on our part in any of these cases that were filed against us after we emerged from bankruptcy that remain unresolved could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nCompliance with environmental, health, safety and other related laws and regulations is costly, and our ongoing operations may expose us to related liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to the protection of the environment or human health and safety. We are subject to various U.S. federal statutes and the regulations implementing them, as well as similar laws and regulations at the state and local levels and in other countries in which we operate. If we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations, we may be subject to significant liabilities for fines, penalties or damages, or lose or be denied significant operating permits.\nIn addition, we may be subject to product liability allegations involving claims of personal injury or property damage. The sale and servicing of complex, large-scale equipment used in a variety of locations and climates and integrating a variety of manufactured and purchased components entails an inherent risk of disputes and liabilities related to the operation and performance of the equipment and the health and safety of the workers who operate and come into contact with the machinery. Because our products are used primarily in power plants, claims could arise in different contexts, including fires, explosions and power surges, which can result in significant property damage or personal injury, and equipment failure, which can result in personal injury or damage to other equipment in the power plant.\nThe insurance policies we maintain to cover claims of this nature are subject to deductibles and recovery limitations as well as limitations on contingencies covered, and we may, therefore, suffer losses from these claims for which no insurance recovery is available. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe effects of providing warranties for our products could result in significant unanticipated costs and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe generally provide warranties for terms of three years or less on our products. These warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products. The need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products and adversely affect our reputation. Any substantial payments made or costs incurred under our warranty program could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nExpiration of the Price-Anderson Act\u2019s indemnification authority could have adverse consequences for our Services segment.\nWe provide services to the nuclear industry through our Services segment. The Price-Anderson Act promotes the nuclear industry by offering broad indemnification to commercial nuclear power plant operators and the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents at power plants licensed by the NRC and at DOE nuclear facilities. That indemnification protects not only the NRC licensee or DOE prime contractor, but also others like us who may be doing work under contract or subcontract for a licensed power plant or under a DOE prime contract. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the period of coverage to include all nuclear power reactors issued construction permits through December 31, 2025. If the Price-Anderson Act\u2019s indemnification authority expires, a problem related to our provision of services at a nuclear facility could lead to a damage claim against us for which we might not be entitled to indemnification. In addition, any well-publicized problem with those services, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our reputation and reduce demand for our services.\nOur revenue could be adversely affected if our patents and other intellectual property rights are unable to protect our proprietary products.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights to the technologies and know-how used in our proprietary products and software programs. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of trade secret, unfair competition and similar laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot provide assurance that we can meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology.\nIf we were required to commence legal actions to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, we could incur\nsubstantial losses and/or costs and divert management\u2019s attention from operations. Any such losses or diverted attention could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flow.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, including engineers, skilled workers and key officers, could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified professional and/or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs, either through direct hiring, subcontracting or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals, is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for these professionals is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel. Our ability to successfully execute our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified, experienced mechanical, design, structural and software engineers, service technicians and marketing and sales personnel in our Mechanical Solutions, Electrical Solutions and Services segments. Demand for these workers can, at times, be high and the supply extremely limited. Our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers, and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers.\nThe restatement of our historical financial results and the poor financial performance of our domestic Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments have caused significant employee turnover and made it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain qualified personnel, the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled, which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating new employees. In addition, the failure to attract and retain key employees, including officers, could impair our ability to sustain or expand our operations, provide services to our customers and conduct our business effectively.\nDemand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic slowdowns and reductions in private industry and government spending. In times of general economic contraction, our revenue, profits and financial condition may be adversely affected and will not necessarily rise in tandem with general economic expansion.\nThe industries we serve historically have been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general slowdowns in the U.S. and international economies. Consequently, our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate depending on the level of demand for products and services from these industries.\nOrders for new electrical power generation capacity are placed by our customers and have long lead times. Consequently, our bookings and revenue may rise or fall sharply as total industry orders tend to follow pronounced cycles of general expansion and contraction. During a contraction phase, limited investment in new projects, deferrals of planned projects and project cancellations may significantly reduce our potential recognition of revenue and profits. At the end of an expansion phase, any existence of excess capacity will negatively affect power prices, which will result in a reduction in new orders. In addition to being cyclical in nature, our revenue does not correlate precisely with changes in actual or forecasted new capacity due to timing differences in revenue recognition.\nDuring periods of declining demand for power, many of our customers may face budget shortfalls or may delay capital expenditures, which could result in a decrease in the overall demand for our products and services. Our customers may find it more difficult to obtain project financing due to limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the global credit markets. In addition, our customers may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may be affected in times of economic slowdown. Any such reduction in private industry or government spending could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, net income or overall financial condition.\nInformation technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely upon information technology to manage and conduct business, both internally and with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data, including, in certain instances, customer and supplier business information. Accordingly, maintaining the security of our computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impact. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and\nperpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, so we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our information technology systems and security measures as a result of third party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier and other third party liabilities. Any damage, security breach, delay or loss of critical data associated with our systems may delay or prevent certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional significant resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nOur failure to comply with applicable governmental privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally could substantially impact our business, operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and foreign privacy laws and regulations. Changes in privacy and data security laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could have a negative effect on our operating methods and costs. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in the termination or loss of contracts, the imposition of contractual damages, private and government civil litigation, civil sanctions, damage to our reputation or, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, business and prospects. Determining compliance with such regulations is complicated by the fact that many of these laws and regulations have not been fully interpreted by governing regulatory authorities or the courts, and many of the provisions of such laws and regulations are open to a range of interpretations. There can be no assurance that we are, or have been, in compliance with all applicable existing laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with new laws or regulations.\nWith respect to trans-border data flows from the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), we have historically relied on the U.S. European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, as agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the E.U. and Switzerland, respectively, as a means to legally transfer European personal information from Europe to the U.S. and to process that information in the U.S. However, on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d) invalidated the legal basis for the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework, and the Swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework. As a result, we have begun to undertake efforts to conform transfers of personal information from the EEA based on current regulatory obligations, the guidance of data protection authorities and evolving best practices. Despite these efforts, we may be unsuccessful in establishing conforming means of transferring such data from the EEA. The legitimacy of these alternate means is subject to differing interpretations among various European jurisdictions and, as a result, we may experience hesitancy, reluctance or refusal by European or multi-national clients to use our services due to the potential risk exposure they may face as a result of the ECJ ruling and the current data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities. Furthermore, the ECJ\u2019s decision may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfers for us and our clients. These developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current and future status of the data protection laws, policies and enforcement within the United Kingdom are now increasingly uncertain in light of the vote to leave the E.U., exacerbating the potential impact of regulatory uncertainty.\nOn July 12, 2016, the European Commission and U.S. Department of Commerce announced that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework had been accepted. We adopted a Privacy Shield Policy that is compliant with that framework on September 23, 2016 and received confirmation from the Commerce Department that our self-certification had been finalized and became effective January 26, 2017. We have begun training our human resources and information technology teams on the Privacy Shield Policy and our obligations. While we believe our efforts will allow us to comply with the requirements of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with European privacy laws could result in fines and other penalties and could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new customers.\nThe supply and cost of materials we use in manufacturing our products fluctuate and could increase our operating costs.\nSteel is a significant portion of the raw materials used in our products. Local shortages of steel plate sometimes arise, and it is possible that an adequate supply of steel will not continue to be available in all locations on terms acceptable to us. The materials we use in our products are subject to price fluctuations that we cannot control. Changes in the cost of raw materials can have a significant effect on our gross margins. Rapid increases in material prices are difficult to pass through to customers. An inability to pass on these higher costs could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nDuring 2016, we contributed to approximately 60 multiemployer pension plans throughout the U.S. and historically, we have contributed to over 150 multiemployer pension plans in which we still have withdrawal liabilities. We believe that our responsibility for potential withdrawal liabilities associated with participating in multiemployer pension plans is limited because the building and construction trades exemption pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 should apply to the substantial majority of our plan contributions. However, pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and other applicable laws, we are exposed to other potential liabilities associated with plans that are underfunded. As of December 31, 2016, we had been notified that certain pension plans were in critical funding status. Currently, certain plans are developing, or have developed, a rehabilitation plan that may call for a reduction in participant benefits or an increase in future employer contributions. Therefore, in the future, we could be responsible for potential surcharges, excise taxes and/or additional contributions related to these plans, which could impact our liquidity and results of operations. While we continue to actively monitor, assess and take steps to limit our potential exposure to any surcharges, excise taxes, additional contributions and/or withdrawal liabilities, any market conditions or the number of participating employers remaining in each plan may result in a reorganization, insolvency or mass withdrawal that could have a material adverse effect on the funded status of the multiemployer plans and our potential withdrawal liability.\nForeign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects.\nWe generally attempt to denominate our contracts in U.S. dollars or in the currencies of our expenditures. However, we do enter into contracts that subject us to foreign exchange risks, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. We may seek to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by limiting foreign currency contracts to those currencies where we have ongoing operating expenditures or entering into hedge contracts if there are limited ongoing expenditures in the same currencies. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks, and such risks have the potential to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or profit.\nExtensive government legislation and regulatory initiatives could increase costs and impose burdensome operating restrictions that may cause operational delays.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) may implement more stringent regulations for hydraulic fracturing, the process of injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure underground, which releases natural gas. Currently, Congress and the EPA are studying environmental contamination related to hydraulic fracturing and the impact of fracturing on public health. In March 2015, Congress introduced legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing and require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Additionally, some states have adopted, and others are considering, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing. In March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian land. In June 2016, a federal judge held that the Bureau of Land Management had no authority to issue such regulations, and the decision was appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the current administration has indicated it does not intend to contest the decision and has proposed a repeal of the standards altogether. The ultimate status of such regulation is currently unknown.\nAdditionally, the EPA has focused its energy on more rulemaking to curb emissions of methane, smog forming volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants from oil and gas sources. Through the New Source Performance Standards, EPA has finalized and plans to finalize in 2016 rules that clarify definitions and implement more stringent emission controls on associated equipment like tanks and compressors used to process and transport natural gas. In August 2015, the EPA finalized rules that clarified the definitions of \u201clow pressure wells\u201d and \u201cstorage vessel,\u201d which may affect plant construction. Any new laws, rules, regulations or permitting requirements regarding the oil and natural gas industries could lead to delays in the construction of new gas turbine power plants and/or increased operating costs for existing gas turbine power plants, which could negatively impact demand for our products.\nA change in our product mix could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results may be affected by a change in our product mix on which our gross margin depends. Changes in our product mix may result from marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers. Our outlook, budgeting and strategic planning assume a certain product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected mix or products and services, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws in the countries in which we operate. Failure to comply with these laws could result in our becoming subject to penalties and the disruption of our business activities.\nMany of the countries in which we transact business have laws that restrict the offer or payment of anything of value to government officials or other persons with the intent of gaining business or favorable government action. We are subject to these laws, as well as being governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act restricting these types of activities. In addition to prohibiting certain bribery-related activity with foreign officials and other persons, these laws provide for recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Any failure by us, our subcontractors, agents or others who work for us on our behalf to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties. The failure to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could also result in the disruption of our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. We continue to assess the impact of various legislative proposals, including U.S. federal and state proposals, and modifications to existing tax treaties that could result in a material increase in our taxes. We cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing treaties, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWork disruptions resulting from the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our operating performance.\nCertain of our temporary Services segment craft employees are represented by labor unions with which we have collective bargaining agreements. There can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions associated with a lengthy strike or the expiration or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or other work stoppage at our facilities or customer locations, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly and may be affected by numerous factors (some of which are beyond our control), including:\n\u00b7\nThe risk factors described in this Item 1A;\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry;\n\u00b7\nThe significant concentration of ownership of our common stock in the hands of a small number of investors;\n\u00b7\nChanges in supply and demand of components and materials;\n\u00b7\nChanges in tax or accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u00b7\nA shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nChanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nGeneral conditions in our customers\u2019 industries; and\n\u00b7\nThe degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions.\nFrom December 31, 2012 to September 5, 2017 the closing price of our common stock ranged from $20.86 to $1.62 per share. Continued declines in the price of our common stock could impede our ability to obtain additional capital, attract and retain qualified employees and reduce the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the reduced stock price also increases the cost to us, in terms of dilution, of using our equity for employee compensation.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of similarly situated companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action lawsuits filed against us. If additional suits were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could also negatively impact the market price of our stock.\nDelisting of our common stock from the NYSE and subsequent quotation on the OTC Pink\u00ae Marketplace-Limited Information Tier (\u201cOTC\u201d) operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. may continue to decrease the value of our common stock and prevent certain investors from investing or achieving a meaningful degree of liquidity.\nOn March 30, 2016, we announced that we expected the NYSE to initiate procedures to delist our common stock, including the issuance of a delisting notice, and that we planned to disclose the receipt of such notice in a subsequent Current Report on Form 8-K. We subsequently received that notice, and the NYSE suspended trading in our common stock, effective March 30, 2016, and our common stock was subsequently delisted. As a result, our common stock is now quoted on the OTC. We cannot assure investors that our common stock will be listed on a national exchange such as the NASDAQ Stock Market, the NYSE or another securities exchange once we become current in our filing obligations with the SEC.\nBased upon the fact that our common stock is no longer registered for trading on a national exchange and that the value of our issued and outstanding common stock has decreased in value, there may be investment loss for stockholders or certain stockholders may no longer be permitted to invest in our common stock. Bid quotations on the OTC can be sporadic and may not provide any meaningful liquidity to investors. An investor may find it difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. As a result of these limitations, our common stock has fewer market makers, lower trading volumes and larger spreads between bid and asked prices than securities listed on a national stock exchange or automated quotation system would typically have.\nBecause there may be a limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock, the share price of our common stock is more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the market\u2019s perception of our business and announcements made by us, our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships. There may also be fewer institutional investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes or to otherwise arrange for any financing that we may need in the future.\nWe are also no longer subject to the NYSE\u2019s rules, such as corporate governance requirements or the minimum market capitalization and stockholders\u2019 equity criteria. Without required compliance with such standards, investor interest in our common stock may decrease. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE may also result in other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence by customers, strategic partners and employees and the loss of investor and media interest in us and our common stock.\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, so investors may not receive any return on investment unless investors sell their shares of common stock for a price greater than that which investors paid for them.\nOn May 30, 2012, our Board adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock; however, we have not paid any dividends since March 2015. The costs associated with the restatement of our historical financial results, as well as related matters, has presented a significant financial burden on our company, and the continued operation and expansion of our business has required substantial funding. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, our Revolving Credit Facility prevented us from paying dividends. As of September 5, 2017, our Centre Lane Facility continues to prohibit us from paying dividends. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nAny future determination with respect to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, terms of financing arrangements and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Future dividends, their timing and amount will be subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all of our respective laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for organic initiatives and strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; limitations in our Centre Lane Facility; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will declare dividends of any particular amounts or at all. If we do not pay dividends, then our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will occur only if our stock price increases, and such appreciation may not occur.\nActions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly, and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nActivist investors may attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and how our business is governed, or to acquire control over us to increase short term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. In fact, in June 2016, we entered into an election and nomination agreement with certain of our significant stockholders that had filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company. Pursuant to that agreement, we agreed to appoint two additional directors to our Board, one of whom would serve as a representative of those investors. Among other things, we also agreed to various standstill provisions and to include the investors\u2019 designees in our slate of nominees for election as directors at our next two annual meetings of stockholders. The agreement also provides that, because the Company has not held its 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the significant stockholders have the right to terminate the agreement at any time after January 1, 2017.\nWhile we welcome varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock and any of our other efforts to raise additional capital may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity and debt offerings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, investor ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect investor rights as a stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to\ntake specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any of the above could cause a decline in our stock price.", "PERMNO": 88987, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "WLMS"}
