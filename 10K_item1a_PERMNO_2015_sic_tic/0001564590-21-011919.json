Risk Factors.\nInvestment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Our business, operating results, growth prospects and financial condition are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the information in this report and our other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our securities. Each of these risk factors, as well as additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could adversely affect our business, operating results, growth prospects or financial condition, as well as the trading price of our common stock, in which case you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Requirements and Financial Condition\n\u2022\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and expect that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\n\u2022\nWe will require additional financing to obtain regulatory approval for molgramostim and a failure to obtain this necessary capital could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\n\u2022\nOur loan agreement contains covenants which may adversely impact our business; the failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable or accelerate principal payments.\n\u2022\nAny future acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe have significant IPR&D and future impairment of IPR&D may have a significant adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. Our goodwill was fully impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Operations\n\u2022\nWe are substantially dependent upon the clinical, regulatory, and commercial success of our product candidate, molgramostim.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidate.\n\u2022\nWe do not have, and do not have plans to establish commercial manufacturing facilities. We completely rely on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our clinical trial drug and delivery device supplies and, if approved, commercial product materials.\n\u2022\nWe rely significantly on third parties to conduct our nonclinical testing and clinical trials and other aspects of our molgramostim development program.\n\u2022\nOur molgramostim product candidate may cause undesirable side effects or adverse events or have other properties that could delay or prevent our clinical development, regulatory approval, or commercialization.\n\u2022\nWe may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we have announced.\n\u2022\nWe are substantially dependent upon our primary CRO, Parexel, for conducting our IMPALA 2 clinical trial.\n\u2022\nOur employees, independent contractors and consultants, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs and other vendors, and any future commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities.\n\u2022\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of third-party computer system failures, cyber-attacks on third-party systems, or deficiency in our cyber-security.\n\u2022\nIf we or our vendors fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions, private litigation and/or adverse publicity.\n\u2022\nOur operations might be interrupted and financial results could be adversely impacted by the occurrence of a natural disaster, war, system malfunction, terrorism, telecommunication and electrical failures or other catastrophic event.\n\u2022\nWe currently have limited marketing capabilities and no sales organization.\n\u2022\nTo establish a sales and marketing infrastructure and expand our manufacturing capabilities, we will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nRisks Related to Drug Development and Commercialization\n\u2022\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical trials of our molgramostim product candidate, and any positive results in prior clinical trials do not ensure that ongoing or future clinical trials will be successful.\n\u2022\nMolgramostim has received Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and in Europe. While orphan designation provides certain benefits, there are also associated risks.\n\u2022\nDelays in commencement and completion of clinical trials are common and have many causes.\n\u2022\nClinical trials are very expensive, difficult to design and implement, often take many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain.\n\u2022\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the regulatory approval process for any investigational new drug, substantial further testing and validation of our primary product candidate and related manufacturing processes may be required.\n\u2022\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our primary product candidate, we may face regulatory difficulties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nIf our primary product candidate receives regulatory approval but fails to achieve significant market acceptance among the medical community, patients, or third-party payers, the revenue we generate from its sales will be limited.\n\u2022\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our primary product candidate in the U.S., we may never receive approval or commercialize our product outside of the U.S., which would limit our ability to realize our full commercial potential.\n\u2022\nWe must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022\nOur success will depend on obtaining and maintaining effective patent and other intellectual property protection for our primary product candidate and proprietary technology.\n\u2022\nOur success depends on our ability to prevent competitors from duplicating or developing and commercializing equivalent versions of our primary product candidate, but patent protection may be difficult to obtain and any issued claims may be limited.\n\u2022\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies.\n\u2022\nThird parties may claim that our product, if approved, infringe on their proprietary rights and may challenge the approved use or uses of a product or its patent rights through litigation or administrative proceedings.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\u2022\nWe expect competition in the marketplace for our molgramostim product candidate.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to healthcare reform measures and reimbursement policies.\n\u2022\nWe face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product or product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\n\u2022\nOur stock price is expected to continue to be volatile.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to satisfy all applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements, including the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq.\n\u2022\nWe will continue to incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\n\u2022\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nWe have completed certain transactions that likely have resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limiting the use of our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements and Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and expect that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical development-stage biopharmaceutical company and we have not been profitable since we commenced operations and may not ever achieve profitability. In addition, we have limited history as an organization and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry. Drug development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have not obtained any regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, commercialized any of our product candidates, or generated any product revenue. We have devoted significant resources to research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing clinical trials and operations, in addition to acquiring product candidates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss of $49.6 million, and net cash used in operating activities was $39.8 million. At December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment securities were approximately $82.2 million, and working capital was approximately $76.9 million. At December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $257.5 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we seek to advance our molgramostim product candidate through clinical development (IMPALA 2 trial), global regulatory approvals, and commercialization. No revenue from operations will likely be available until, and unless, our current product candidate, molgramostim, is approved by the FDA or another regulatory agency and successfully marketed, or we enter into an arrangement that provides for licensing revenue or other partnering-\nrelated funding, outcomes which we may not achieve. We are also continuously and critically reviewing our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nWe will require additional financing to obtain regulatory approval for molgramostim and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nSince our Aravas subsidiary was formed in 2007, most of our resources have been dedicated to the development and acquisition of our product candidates, molgramostim, vancomycin hydrochloride inhalation powder (\u201cvancomycin\u201d) and Apulmiq. On December 10, 2020, based upon our analysis of the clinical data from the Phase 3 trial of vancomycin, we concluded and announced that the trial missed its primary endpoint, ceasing further development of vancomycin. Our priority remains the continued development of molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP and preparation for an additional Phase 3 trial. We cannot estimate with reasonable certainty the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidate and there is no certainty that we will be able to raise the necessary capital on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur capital requirements for the foreseeable future will depend in large part on, and could increase significantly as a result of, our expenditures on our development programs. Future expenditures on our development programs are subject to many uncertainties, and will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe number, size, complexity, results, and timing of our drug development programs;\n\u2022\nthe timing and terms of any collaborative or other strategic arrangement that we may establish;\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical and nonclinical studies necessary to demonstrate acceptable evidence of the safety and efficacy of our product candidate;\n\u2022\nchanges in standards of care which could increase the size and complexity of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients who participate, the rate of enrollment, and the ratio of randomized to evaluable patients in each clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe ability to locate patients to participate in a trial given the limited number of patients available for orphan or ultra-orphan indications;\n\u2022\nthe number and location of sites and the rate of site initiation in each trial;\n\u2022\nthe duration of patient treatment and follow-up;\n\u2022\nthe potential for additional safety monitoring or other post-marketing trials that may be requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost to manufacture clinical trial material and commercial product, including process development and scale-up activities, and to conduct stability studies, which can last several years;\n\u2022\nthe degree of difficulty and cost involved in securing alternate manufacturers or suppliers of drug product, components, or delivery devices, as necessary to meet FDA requirements and/or commercial demand;\n\u2022\nthe costs, requirements, timing of, and the ability to, secure regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we increase our workforce and the costs involved in recruiting, training, and incentivizing new employees;\n\u2022\nthe costs related to developing, acquiring, and/or contracting for sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, supply chain management capabilities, and regulatory compliance capabilities, if we obtain regulatory approval for our primary product candidate and commercialize it without a partner;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in evaluating competing technologies and market developments or the loss in sales in case of such competition;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in establishing, enforcing, or defending patent claims and other proprietary rights; and\n\u2022\nnegative impacts from the scope and spread of COVID-19.\nAdditional capital may not be available when we need it, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we will be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing, manufacturing or distribution capabilities, development activities, other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidate, or conduct preclinical or clinical trials.\nIf we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams, or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferential rights over our common stock. In particular, due to the price per share of our common stock, any sale of our equity securities to raise significant capital would result in substantial ownership dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, it may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures, or subject to specified financial ratios, any of which could restrict our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidate or operate as a business.\nOur loan agreement contains covenants which may adversely impact our business; the failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable or accelerate principal payments.\nOn April 28, 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, as subsequently amended on October 31, 2017, December 4, 2018, and January 31, 2020 between us and Aravas, as co-borrowers, and Silicon Valley Bank (the \u201cAmended Loan Agreement\u201d). The Amended Loan Agreement includes a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments, granting liens, disposing of assets, paying dividends, and redeeming or repurchasing capital stock, subject to certain exceptions. Collectively, these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisitions or engage in other transactions. In addition, the Amended Loan Agreement includes covenants requiring, among other things, that we provide financial statements, comply with all laws, pay all taxes, maintain insurance, and satisfy an equity-based milestone. If we are not able to comply with these covenants, the outstanding loans under the Amended Loan Agreement could become immediately due and payable and would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business, and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to decline. The Amended Loan Agreement requires us to have an ongoing Phase 3 or Phase 4 clinical trial evaluating our molgramostim product for the treatment of aPAP in which the first patient has been dosed by the end of the first quarter of 2021. This milestone, if not met, will cease the interest only period and principal plus interest payments will be due in equal monthly installments over 24 months beginning April 1, 2021. In February 2021, Silicon Valley Bank agreed to extend the requirement for the date of the first patient dosed in our Phase 3 IMPALA 2 trial to the end of the second quarter of 2021.\nAny future acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe may, from time to time, evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, or technologies. In addition, we may evaluate joint ventures, licensing opportunities, and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance, or integrate acquisitions of any businesses, products, or technologies. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert our management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Any cash acquisition we pursue would diminish the funds otherwise available to us for other uses. Any acquisition using our stock would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nIf we engage in acquisitions of companies, products, or technologies in order to execute our business strategy, we may need to raise additional capital. We may raise additional capital in the future through one or more financing vehicles that may be available to us including (i) new collaborative agreements; (ii) expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships; (iii) private financings; (iv) other equity or debt financings; (v) monetizing assets; and/or (vi) the public offering of securities.\nIf we are required to raise additional capital in the future, it may not be available on favorable financing terms within the time required, or at all. If additional capital is not available on favorable terms when needed, we will be required to raise capital on adverse terms or significantly reduce operating expenses through the restructuring of our operations or deferral of strategic business initiatives. If we raise additional capital through a public offering of securities or equity, a substantial number of additional shares may be issued, which may negatively affect our stock price and these additional shares will dilute the ownership interest of our current investors.\nWe have significant IPR&D and future impairment of IPR&D may have a significant adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. Our goodwill was fully impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had IPR&D of approximately $12.2 million. Our intangible assets have been previously impaired and remain subject to additional impairment analyses whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. We test our goodwill, if any, and IPR&D for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the asset may be impaired. If an impairment is identified, we would be required to record an impairment charge with respect to the impaired asset to our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. A significant impairment charge could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to evaluate our intangible assets for potential impairment in accordance with our accounting policies.\nEvents giving rise to impairment are difficult to predict and are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry. Some of the potential risks that could result in impairment of our goodwill and IPR&D include negative clinical trial results, adverse regulatory developments, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval, additional development costs, changes in the manner of our use or development of our product candidate, competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws, prices that third parties are willing to pay for our IPR&D or similar assets in an arm\u2019s-length transaction being\nless than the carrying value of our IPR&D, and other market and economic environment changes or trends, such as the ultimate scope and scale of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the impact of COVID-19 on patient enrollment in our IMPALA 2 trial. Events or changes in circumstances may lead to significant impairment charges on our IPR&D in the future, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Operations\nWe are substantially dependent upon the clinical, regulatory, and commercial success of our product candidate, molgramostim. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results, and our clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities the safety and efficacy of our molgramostim product candidate.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to advance the clinical development of molgramostim for the treatment of patients with aPAP.\nThe topline results of the molgramostim Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of aPAP, designated as IMPALA, were announced on June 12, 2019. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of change in alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (\u201cA-aDO2\u201d) compared to placebo. The continuous treatment arm (molgramostim 300 \u00b5g administered once daily continuously over 24 weeks) did show a 12.1 mmHG improvement which is similar to what has been observed in previously published trials, but a larger-than-expected placebo effect was also seen (8.8 mmHg improvement). However, results from IMPALA did show statistically significant improvement in two secondary endpoints: the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (\u201cSGRQ\u201d) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (\u201cDLCO\u201d). Two other secondary endpoints were numerically in favor of the continuous dosing arm of molgramostim but were not statistically significant (six-minute walk distance and time to WLL), while adverse event frequencies were similar between the treatment arms and placebo.\nOn October 1, 2019, we received a written response from the FDA in connection with a Type C meeting regarding the molgramostim development program for aPAP and results from the IMPALA trial in which the FDA indicated that the data provided in the briefing package for the Type C meeting did not provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety.\nOn December 23, 2019, the FDA granted us Breakthrough Therapy designation for molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP, a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we worked with the FDA and EMA regarding the protocol and design of an additional Phase 3 trial of molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP, or the IMPALA 2 trial. IMPALA 2 will be a 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with efficacy endpoints assessed at week 24 for the primary analyses and a sample size of 160 patients. However, the placebo-controlled period will be 48 weeks to better support the durability of treatment effect, as well as long-term safety of the drug, which is intended to be administered chronically. At the end of the placebo-controlled period, both the placebo and non-placebo treatment arms will rollover into a 48-week open-label follow-on period in which all patients will receive molgramostim 300 micrograms administered once-daily and provide useful information on the long-term safety of the drug. The primary endpoint of the IMPALA 2 trial will be the gas exchange measure of DLCO. Three secondary endpoints designed to measure direct patient benefit will be evaluated which include the SGRQ Total Score, SGRQ Activity Component score, and exercise capacity using a treadmill test.\nAdditionally, as we work to initiate the IMPALA 2 trial, there remains a general uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the aPAP patient population and physicians. Patients suffering from aPAP lung disease are prone to underlying lung conditions and are often treated by infectious disease specialists and pulmonologists. These treating physicians are on the front lines in addressing this global pandemic and must now, understandably, focus their attention on COVID-19.\nClinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as demonstrated by our IMPALA trial results in June 2019. The results of preclinical and early clinical trials of our product candidate may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical trials, and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the required safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier clinical trials, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate.\nGiven the developmental nature of our product candidate, we are subject to risks associated with initiating, completing, and achieving positive outcomes from our current and future clinical trials, including:\n\u2022\nslow implementation, enrollment, and completion of the clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to enroll enough patients in the clinical trials;\n\u2022\nlow patient compliance and adherence to dosing and reporting requirements, for example, incomplete reporting of patient reported outcomes in the clinical trials or missed doses;\n\u2022\nlack of safety and efficacy in the clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in manufacture of supplies for both drug and device components due to delays in formulation, process development, or manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nrequirements for additional nonclinical or clinical trials based on changes to formulation and/or changes to regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npoor quality or missing data from the clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nrequirements for additional clinical trials based on inconclusive or negative clinical results or changes in market, standard of care, and/or regulatory requirements.\nIf we successfully complete the necessary clinical trials for our product candidate, our success will be subject to the risks associated with obtaining regulatory approvals, product launch, and commercialization, including:\n\u2022\nFDA rejection of our BLA submissions for our product candidate;\n\u2022\nregulatory rejection in the EU, Japan, and other markets;\n\u2022\ndelays during regulatory review and/or requirements of additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, nonclinical, or clinical studies, resulting in increased costs and/or delays in marketing approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate in the U.S. and other markets;\n\u2022\ninability to consistently manufacture commercial supplies of drug and delivery devices resulting in slowed market development and lower revenue;\n\u2022\npoor commercial sales due to:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our future sales organization or our potential commercialization partners to effectively sell the product candidate;\n\u2022\nour lack of success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration, and use of our product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety, and relative efficacy of other products or treatments for the targeted indications of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nlow patient demand for the product candidate; and\n\u2022\npoor prescription coverage and inadequate reimbursement for our product candidate;\n\u2022\nour inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in our product candidate; and\n\u2022\nreduction in the safety profile of our product candidate following approval.\nMany of these clinical, regulatory, and commercial matters are beyond our control and are subject to other risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to advance our product candidate further through final clinical development, or obtain regulatory approval of, commercialize, or generate significant revenue. If we cannot do so, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidate.\nWe have historically operated with a limited number of employees that manage third parties for most development activities. Institutional knowledge is concentrated within a small number of employees. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified management, clinical, and scientific personnel. Our future success is highly dependent upon the contributions of our senior management, as well as our senior scientists and other members of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals, who all have at-will employment arrangements with us, could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials, or the commercialization of our product candidate.\nReplacing key employees may be a difficult, costly, and protracted process, and we may not have other personnel with the capacity to assume all the responsibilities of a key employee upon his/her departure. Transition periods can be difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business.\nIn addition, there may be intense competition from other companies and organizations for qualified personnel. Other companies and organizations with which we compete for personnel may have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than us, and a history of successful development and commercialization. If we cannot attract and retain skilled personnel, as needed, we may not achieve our development and other goals.\nThe success of our business will depend on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with respected service providers and industry-leading consultants and advisers. If we cannot develop and maintain such relationships as needed, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates may be limited. In addition, our outsourcing strategy, which has included engaging consultants that spend considerable time to manage key functional areas, may subject us to scrutiny under labor laws and regulations, which may divert management time and attention and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has required us to adapt our operations, such as enabling employees to work remotely, which may adversely affect their employment satisfaction or productivity.\nWe do not have, and do not have plans to establish commercial manufacturing facilities. We completely rely on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our clinical trial drug and delivery device supplies and, if approved, commercial product materials. The loss of any of these vendors or a vendor\u2019s failure to provide us with an adequate supply of clinical trial or commercial product material in a timely manner and on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business.\nWe outsource the manufacture of our molgramostim product candidate and do not plan to establish our own manufacturing facilities. To manufacture our product candidate, we have made numerous custom modifications at contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d), making us highly dependent on these CMOs. For clinical and commercial supplies, if approved, we have supply agreements with third party CMOs for drug substance, finished drug product, drug delivery devices and other necessary components of our molgramostim product candidate. While we have secured long-term commercial supply agreements with many of the third party CMOs, we would need to negotiate agreements for commercial supply with several important CMOs, and we may not be able to reach agreement on acceptable terms. In addition, we rely on these third parties to conduct or assist us in key manufacturing development activities, including qualification of equipment, developing and validating methods, defining critical process parameters, releasing component materials, and conducting stability testing, among other things. If these third parties are unable to perform their tasks successfully in a timely manner, whether for technical, financial, or other reasons, we may be unable to secure clinical trial material, or commercial supply material if approved, which likely would delay the initiation, conduct, or completion of our clinical trials or prevent us from having enough commercial supply material for sale, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business. For example, the impacts of the current COVID-19 global pandemic are rapidly evolving. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our ability to procure sufficient supplies for the development and commercialization of our product candidate will depend on the severity and duration of the spread of COVID-19, and the actions undertaken to contain the pandemic or treat its effects.\nAll manufacturers of our clinical trial material and, if approved, commercial product, including drug substance manufacturers, must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and applicable requirements of foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our clinical trial material may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state, and foreign regulatory requirements. While we and our representatives generally monitor and audit our manufacturers\u2019 systems, we do not have full control over their ongoing compliance with these regulations. Although the responsibility to maintain cGMP compliance is shared between us and the third-party manufacturer, we bear ultimate responsibility for our supply chain and compliance with regulatory standards. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay or failure to obtain product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval.\nCurrently, we do not have alternative vendors to back up our primary vendors of clinical trial material or, if approved, commercial supply material. Identification of and discussions with other vendors may be protracted and/or unsuccessful, or these new vendors may be unsuccessful in producing the same results as the current primary vendors producing the material. Therefore, if our primary vendors become unable or unwilling to perform their required activities, we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial material and, ultimately, product for commercial sale, which would materially and adversely affect our development programs, commercial activities, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the FDA or regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. may require that we have an alternate manufacturer of a drug product before approving it for marketing and sale in the U.S. or abroad and securing such alternate manufacturer before approval of a BLA could result in considerable additional time and cost prior to BLA approval. We are pursuing but have not yet engaged a second source manufacturer for molgramostim.\nAny new manufacturer or supplier of finished drug product or its component materials, including drug substance and delivery devices, would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing of such product or ingredients required by us. The FDA or foreign\nregulatory agency may require us to conduct additional clinical trials, collect stability data, and provide additional information concerning any new supplier, or change in a validated manufacturing process, including scaling-up production, before we could distribute products from that manufacturer or supplier or revised process. For example, if we were to engage a third party other than our current CMOs to supply the drug substance or drug product for future clinical trials or commercial sale, the FDA or regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. may require us to conduct additional clinical and nonclinical studies to ensure comparability of the drug substance or drug product manufactured by our current CMOs to that manufactured by the new supplier. Changing of suppliers or equipment is particularly challenging for companies like us, with inhalation products, because any change could alter the performance of the drug product.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling-up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, and shortages of qualified personnel. Our product candidate has not been manufactured at the scale we believe will be necessary to maximize their commercial value and, accordingly, we may encounter difficulties in attempting to scale-up production and may not succeed in that effort on a timely basis or at all. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements as we scale up initial production capabilities, which may delay our scale-up activities and/or add expense.\nIf our manufacturers encounter any of the aforementioned difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations or there are delays entering commercial supply agreements due to capital constraints, we may have insufficient quantities of material to support ongoing and/or planned clinical trials or to meet commercial demand, if approved. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of materials necessary or useful to manufacture our product candidate could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with our development programs, and depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at significant additional expense or terminate the trials completely. Delays or interruptions in the supply of commercial product could result in increased cost of goods sold and lost sales. We cannot provide assurance that manufacturing or quality control problems will not arise in connection with the manufacture of our clinical trial material or commercial product, if approved, or that third-party manufacturers will be able to maintain the necessary governmental licenses and approvals to continue manufacturing such clinical trial material or commercial product, as applicable. In addition, molgramostim is currently manufactured entirely outside the U.S. and, as a result, we may experience interruptions in supply due to shipping or customs difficulties or regional instability. Furthermore, changes in currency fluctuations, shipping costs, or import tariffs could adversely affect cost of goods sold. Any of the above factors could cause us to delay or suspend anticipated or ongoing trials, regulatory submissions or commercialization of our product candidate, entail higher costs, or result in being unable to effectively commercialize our product. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial material may adversely affect our future costs and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidate on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely significantly on third parties to conduct our nonclinical testing and clinical trials and other aspects of our molgramostim development program, and if those third parties do not satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations or meet anticipated deadlines, the development of our molgramostim product candidate could be adversely affected.\nWe do not employ personnel or possess the facilities necessary to conduct many of the activities associated with our programs. We engage consultants, advisors, contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and others to assist in the design and conduct of nonclinical and clinical trials of our product candidate, with interpretation of the results of those trials and with regulatory activities, and we expect to continue to outsource all or a significant amount of such activities. Specifically, in early 2021, we engaged Parexel to support our IMPALA 2 clinical trial development activities. As a result, many important aspects of our development programs are and will continue to be outside our direct control, and our third-party service providers may not perform their activities as required or expected, including the maintenance of good clinical practice (\u201cGCP\u201d), good laboratories practice (\u201cGLP\u201d), and cGMP compliance, which are ultimately our responsibility to ensure. Further, such third parties may not be as committed to the success of our programs as our own employees and, therefore, may not devote the same time, thoughtfulness, or creativity to completing projects or problem-solving as our own employees would. To the extent we are unable to successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe CROs that we engage to execute our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials, including patient enrollment and the collection and analysis of trial data. We likely will depend on CROs and clinical investigators to conduct future clinical trials and to assist in analyzing data from completed trials and developing regulatory strategies for our product candidate. Individuals working at the CROs with which we contract, as well as investigators at the sites at which our trials are conducted, are not our employees, and we have limited control over the amount or timing of resources that they devote to their programs. In addition, our CROs may be affected by business or workforce interruptions for many reasons, including as a result of an outbreak of COVID-19 or another infectious disease, over which they and we have limited control. If our CROs, trial investigators, and/or third-party sponsors fail to devote sufficient time and resources to trials of our product candidate, if we and/or our CROs do not comply with all GLP and GCP regulatory and contractual requirements, or if their performance is substandard, we may delay commencement and/or completion\nof these trials, submission of applications for regulatory approval, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our product candidate. Failure of CROs to meet their obligations to us could adversely affect development of our product candidate.\nIn addition, CROs we engage may have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Through intentional or unintentional means, our competitors may benefit from lessons learned on our projects that could ultimately harm our competitive position. Moreover, if a CRO fails to properly, or at all, perform our activities during a clinical trial, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, or at all. Switching CROs may increase costs and divert management time and attention. In addition, there likely would be a transition period before a new CRO commences work. These challenges could result in delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired and/or announced development timelines and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Additionally, the COVID-19 global pandemic may pose significant risks to our development and commercialization of our product candidate as our third-party service providers, manufacturers, and suppliers are experiencing restrictions and challenges which could negatively impact our supply-chain and progress of our development pipeline.\nOur molgramostim product candidate may cause undesirable side effects or adverse events or have other properties that could delay or prevent our clinical development, regulatory approval, or commercialization.\nUndesirable side effects or adverse events caused by our molgramostim product candidate could interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidate. A significant challenge in clinical development is that the patient population in early trials, where small numbers of patients are required, is different from the patient population observed in later stage trials, where larger groups of patients are required. For example, patients in earlier stage trials may be more sick, compliant, or otherwise motivated than patients in larger trials. As such, efficacy or safety results may differ significantly between trials. If we fail to demonstrate the efficacy of our drug candidate or undesirable side effects occur, they could possibly prevent approval, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIf our product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or change the labeling of the product; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from its sale.\nWe may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we have announced.\nWe have set goals for accomplishing certain objectives material to the successful development of our molgramostim product candidate. The actual timing of these events may vary due to many factors, including delays or failures in our nonclinical testing, clinical trials, and manufacturing and regulatory activities and the uncertainties inherent in the regulatory approval process. From time to time, we create estimates for the completion of enrollment of or announcement of data from clinical trials of our product candidate. However, predicting the rate of enrollment or the time from completion of enrollment to announcement of data for any clinical trial requires us to make significant assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. As an example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we ceased enrollment in our discontinued AVAIL and ENCORE trials. Our estimated enrollment rates and the actual rates may differ materially, and the time required to complete enrollment of any clinical trial may be considerably longer than we estimate. Such delays may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we complete a clinical trial with successful results, we may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we initially anticipate or announce. If a development plan for a product candidate becomes more extensive and costly than anticipated, we may determine that the associated time and cost are not financially justifiable and, as a result, may discontinue development in a particular indication or of the product candidate as a whole. In addition, even if a trial did complete with successful results, changes may occur in regulatory requirements or policy during the period of product development and/or regulatory review of a BLA that relate to the data required to be included in BLAs, which may require additional studies that may be costly and time consuming. Any of these actions may be viewed negatively, which could adversely impact our financial condition.\nFurther, throughout development, we must provide adequate assurance to the FDA and other regulatory authorities that we can consistently develop and produce our product candidate in conformance with GLP, GCP, cGMP, and other regulatory standards. As discussed above, we rely on CMOs for the manufacture of clinical, and future commercial, quantities of our product candidate. If future FDA or other regulatory authority inspections identify cGMP compliance deficiencies at these third-party facilities, production of our clinical trial material or, in the future, commercial product, could be disrupted, causing potentially substantial delay in or failure of development or commercialization of our product candidate.\nWe are substantially dependent upon our primary CRO, Parexel, for conducting our IMPALA 2 clinical trial.\nWe do not employ personnel or possess the facilities necessary to conduct many of the activities associated with our IMPALA 2 clinical trial. We have engaged a CRO, Parexel, to assist in the conduct of the trial. As a result, many important aspects of our development programs are, and will, continue to be outside our direct control. Parexel may not perform their activities as required or expected, including the maintenance of GCP and GLP. Further, Parexel may not be as committed to the success of our program as our own employees would. To the extent we are unable to successfully manage the performance of Parexel, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur employees, independent contractors and consultants, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs and other vendors, and any future commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors and consultants, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs and other vendors, and any future commercial partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing standards required by cGMP or our standards, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to them. The misconduct of our employees and other service providers could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, it is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against them, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. For example, if one of our manufacturing partners were placed under a consent decree, we may be hampered in our ability to manufacture clinical or commercial supplies.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of third-party computer system failures, cyber-attacks on third-party systems, or deficiency in our cyber-security.\nWe rely on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems, including third-party \u201ccloud based\u201d service providers, to keep financial records, maintain laboratory data, clinical data and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties, and operate other critical functions. This includes critical systems such as email, other communication tools, electronic document repositories, and archives. If any of these third-party IT providers are compromised due to computer viruses, unauthorized access, malware, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures, electrical failures, cyber-attacks, or cyber-intrusions over the internet, then sensitive emails or documents could be exposed or deleted. Similarly, we could incur business disruption if our access to the internet is compromised and we are unable to connect with third-party IT providers. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion by computer hackers, foreign governments, or cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, we rely on those third parties to safeguard important confidential personal data regarding our employees and patients enrolled in our clinical trials. If a disruption event were to occur and cause interruptions in a third-party IT provider\u2019s operations, it could result in a disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing, or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in loss or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and development of our product candidate could be delayed or could fail.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have modified our business practices with a majority of our employees working remotely from their homes to have our operations uninterrupted as much as possible. Technology in employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunication systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems; however, to date and to our knowledge, such attacks have not resulted in any material damage to us.\nWe are continually working to maintain reliable systems to improve our operations. Our efforts include, but are not limited to, the following: firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning, and routine password modifications. Our internal IT systems environment continues to evolve and our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace as new threats emerge. No assurance can be given that our efforts to continue to enhance our systems will be successful.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business, or if we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, including the GDPR or the CCPA, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nA number of state, national, and foreign laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. Due to our Danish subsidiary, Savara ApS, our clinical trial activities, and operations in Europe, we are subject to data protection laws in the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). The GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, has caused the EU requirements for the protection of personal data to become more stringent and increased the penalties for noncompliance. Penalties can consist of fines up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenues, whichever is higher. As a result, we have been required to implement additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules, which may cause us to incur additional costs. Similarly, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new rights to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA creates a private right of action for statutory damages for certain breaches of information and the California Attorney General has proposed regulations under the CCPA which became effective on July 1, 2020. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act was passed in November 2020 expanding CCPA regulations and will have an impact on our future privacy obligations. Other states have enacted or proposed legislation that regulates the collection, use, and sale of personal information, and such regimes might not be compatible with either the GDPR or the CCPA. We may be required to implement additional mechanisms to comply with the CCPA or such other state laws, which may be difficult to implement and may require us to incur additional costs. If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, including the GDPR, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur operations might be interrupted and financial results could be adversely impacted by the occurrence of a natural disaster, war, system malfunction, terrorism, telecommunication and electrical failures or other catastrophic event, or public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in a single commercial facility in Austin, Texas, USA. We maintain a second office in a single commercial facility in Denmark where many of our product development staff are located. Important documents and records, including copies of our regulatory documents and other records for our product candidate, are located both at a secure offsite document storage facility as well as at our own facilities, and we depend on our facilities for the continued operation of our business. Natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as wildfires and other fires, earthquakes and extended power interruptions, terrorist attacks, public health crises, or severe weather conditions could significantly disrupt our operations and result in additional, unplanned expense. We are currently preparing a formal business continuity/disaster recovery plan; however, any natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our business operations and result in setbacks to our development programs. Even though we believe we carry commercially reasonable insurance, we might suffer losses that are not covered by or exceed the coverage available under these insurance policies.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, resulting in significant disruptions to U.S. and international manufacturing and supply chains or operations as well as travel restrictions in the U.S., Denmark, and many other countries. While the continued impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results is\nuncertain, a continued and prolonged public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be delays in the manufacturing supply chain for our product candidate, including delays in procurement of materials for certain of our clinical trials due to the outbreak, delays in clinical trials or recruitment, or in a more severe scenario, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be more severely affected. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of any business disruption or potential impact to our business of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to predict.\nWe currently have limited marketing capabilities and no sales organization. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties, we will be unable to successfully commercialize our primary product candidate, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nTo commercialize our molgramostim product candidate, if approved, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions we seek to enter, we must build our marketing, sales, managerial, and other non-technical capabilities, or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product receives regulatory approval, we expect to market such product in the U.S. through a focused, specialized sales force, which will be costly and time consuming. Institutionally, we have no prior experience in the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain, and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Outside of the U.S., we may consider collaboration arrangements. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product in certain markets. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our product. If we are not successful in commercializing our molgramostim product, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we would incur significant additional losses.\nTo establish a sales and marketing infrastructure and expand our manufacturing capabilities, we will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of March 8, 2021, we had 27 employees including 17 employees engaged in research and development. As we advance our molgramostim product candidate through the development process and to commercialization, we will need to continue to expand our development, regulatory, quality, managerial, sales and marketing, operational, finance, and other resources to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities, and commercialize our product candidate, if approved. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various manufacturers and collaborative partners, suppliers, and other organizations.\nDue to our limited financial resources and our limited experience in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively maintain or manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. In addition, the physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management attention and resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our development and strategic objectives, or disrupt our operations, which could materially impact our business, revenue, and operating results.\nRisks Related to Drug Development and Commercialization\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical trials of our molgramostim product candidate, and any positive results in prior clinical trials do not ensure that ongoing or future clinical trials will be successful.\nPharmaceutical products are subject to stringent regulatory requirements covering quality, safety, and efficacy. The burden of proof is on the manufacturer, such as us, to show with substantial clinical data that the risk/benefit profile for any new drug is favorable. Only after successfully completing extensive pharmaceutical development, nonclinical testing, and clinical trials may a product be considered for regulatory approval.\nClinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, they can take many years to complete, and outcomes are inherently uncertain. A drug product may fail to demonstrate positive results at any stage of testing despite having progressed satisfactorily through nonclinical testing and initial clinical trials. There is significant risk in clinical development where later stage clinical trials are designed and powered based on the analysis of data from earlier trials, with these earlier trials involving a smaller number of patients, and the results of the earlier trials being driven primarily by a subset of responsive patients. In addition, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Further, clinical trial data frequently are susceptible to varying interpretations. Medical professionals and/or regulatory authorities may analyze or weigh trial data differently than the sponsor company, resulting in delay or failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate. Additionally, the possible lack of standardization across multiple investigative sites may induce variability in the results which can interfere with the evaluation of treatment effects.\nIf we license rights to develop our product candidate to independent third parties or otherwise permit third parties to evaluate our product candidate in clinical trials, such as an investigator-sponsored clinical trial, we may have limited control over those clinical\ntrials. For example, we have provided molgramostim and placebo for an investigator-sponsored clinical trial by the University of Giessen in Germany that will assess the potential efficacy of molgramostim in preventing progression of COVID-19 pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Any safety or efficacy concern identified in a third-party sponsored trial could adversely affect our or another licensee\u2019s development of our product candidate and prospects for its regulatory approval, even if the data from that trial are subject to varying interpretations and analyses. If serious adverse events are observed in such third-party sponsored trials, it could delay or cause the discontinuation of the development of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere are significant risks that ongoing and future clinical trials of our product candidate will not be successful. Negative or inconclusive results could cause the FDA and other regulatory authorities to require us to repeat or conduct additional clinical trials, which could significantly increase the time and expense associated with development of that product candidate or cause us to elect to discontinue one or more clinical programs. For example, as a result of our IMPALA trial results and related correspondence from the FDA, we are planning an additional Phase 3 trial of molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP. Failure to complete a clinical trial of a product candidate or an unsuccessful result of a clinical trial could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMolgramostim has received Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and in Europe. If a competitor obtains Orphan Drug exclusivity for a product with the same active ingredient and route of delivery as molgramostim for aPAP, we may be unable to market our product candidate until the exclusivity of the competing product expires.\nMolgramostim has received Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. by the FDA and in Europe by the EMA for the treatment of aPAP. Orphan Drug Designation will not shorten the regulatory review or reduce the clinical data requirements needed to obtain approval. If approval is received to market molgramostim, the FDA will not approve a similar product, with the same active ingredient, to molgramostim for seven years and the EMA will not approve a similar product to molgramostim for ten years, unless we are unable to produce enough supply to meet demand in the marketplace or another similar product, with the same active ingredient, is deemed clinically superior. Similar product candidates, with the same active ingredient and route of delivery, may be granted Orphan Drug Designation during the development of the respective products, but the Orphan Drug exclusivity is granted only to the first of such products approved, which means there is risk that a competitor product candidate may receive approval and Orphan Drug exclusivity before us, thus preventing us from marketing our product candidate until the exclusivity of the competing product expires. Also, the Orphan Drug status will not prevent a competitor with a different active ingredient from competing with our product candidate. If we are prevented from marketing one or more product candidate due to a competitor\u2019s Orphan Drug exclusivity, this would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDelays in commencement and completion of clinical trials are common and have many causes. Delays in clinical trials of our molgramostim product candidate would likely increase overall development costs and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize any approved product.\nClinical testing typically is expensive, can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Clinical trials may not commence on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ninability to raise sufficient funding to initiate or continue a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, clinical trial sites, and investigators, which agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval in a prospective country;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CMOs or other vendors for the production and supply of clinical trial material and, if necessary, drug administration devices, which agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation;\n\u2022\ndelays in the production or delivery of sufficient quantities of clinical trial material or drug delivery devices from our CMOs and other vendors to initiate or continue a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays due to product candidate recalls as the result of stability failure, excessive product complaints, or other failures of the product candidate during its use or testing;\n\u2022\ninvalidation of clinical data caused by premature unblinding or integrity issues;\n\u2022\ninvalidation of clinical data caused by mixing up of the active drug and placebo through randomization or manufacturing errors;\n\u2022\ndelays on the part of our CROs, CMOs, and other third-party contractors in developing procedures and protocols or otherwise conducting activities in accordance with applicable policies and procedures and in accordance with agreed upon timelines;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying and hiring or engaging, as applicable, additional employees or consultants to assist in managing clinical trial-related activities;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting and enrolling individuals to participate in a clinical trial, which historically can be challenging in orphan diseases;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by patients dropping out of a clinical trial due to side effects, concurrent disorders, difficulties in adhering to the trial protocol, unknown issues related to different patient profiles than in previous trials, or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a clinical trial, including returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from clinical trial sites dropping out of a trial, providing inadequate staff support for the trial, problems with shipment of trial supplies to clinical sites, or focusing its staff\u2019s efforts on enrolling trials that compete for the same patient population;\n\u2022\nsuspension of enrollment at a trial site or the imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authority following an inspection of clinical trial operations at trial sites or finding of a drug-related serious adverse event;\n\u2022\ndelays in quality control/quality assurance procedures necessary for trial database lock and analysis of unblinded data;\n\u2022\ndelays, inconsistencies, or negative results in statistical analyses of clinical trial data; and\n\u2022\ndelays in enrollment and the treatment of patients caused by COVID-19.\nPatient enrollment, a critical component to successful completion of a clinical trial, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the trial population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, ongoing trial competing for the same patient population and clinicians, and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to available alternatives, including therapies being investigated by other companies which may be viewed as more beneficial or important to study, fear of being randomized to the placebo arm, and changes in standard of care. Challenges to complete enrollment can be exacerbated in orphan indications, like those being pursued by us, with a limited number of qualifying patients and the lack of clinical sites with the necessary expertise and experience to conduct our trials. Further, completion of a clinical trial and/or its results may be adversely affected by failure to retain patients who enroll in a trial but withdraw due to adverse side effects, perceived lack of efficacy, belief that they are on placebo, improvement in condition before treatment has been completed, for personal reasons, without reason, or by patients who fail to return for or complete post-treatment follow-up.\nFor example, although we are not aware of any companies developing an inhaled form of GM-CSF for the treatment of aPAP, Leukine\u00ae (sargramostim), a yeast-derived recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhu-GM-CSF) which is a product of Partner Therapeutics, Inc., is being utilized by some patients, domestically and internationally, for the off-label treatment of aPAP. Additionally, Partner Therapeutics, Inc. is working with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in Japan for regulatory approval of Leukine\u00ae for the treatment of aPAP. We cannot assess the likelihood of formal regulatory approval of Leukine\u00ae, the effectiveness of its off-label administration to patients with aPAP, or the number of aPAP patients using Leukine\u00ae for off-label treatment. However, the current off-label administration of Leukine\u00ae could adversely affect the enrollment of patients in our IMPALA 2 trial.\nAdditionally, as we work to initiate the IMPALA 2 trial, there remains a general uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the aPAP patient population and physicians. Patients suffering from aPAP lung disease are prone to underlying lung conditions and are often treated by infectious disease specialists and pulmonologists. These treating physicians are on the front lines in addressing this global pandemic and must now, understandably, focus their attention on COVID-19.\nAdditionally, on March 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and out of an abundance of caution for people living with CF and clinical trial staff, we announced the close-out of enrollment in our discontinued Phase 3 AVAIL and Phase 2a ENCORE trials. With patient safety at the forefront of the decision and in accordance with guidelines established by the FDA, efforts have been made to allow enrolled patients to continue with trial treatments and site visit protocols, where possible. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause further delays in our clinical trials and have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nClinical trials may not begin on time or be completed in the time frames we anticipate and may be costlier than we anticipate for a variety of reasons, including one or more of those described above. The length of time necessary to successfully complete clinical\ntrials vary significantly and is difficult to predict accurately. We may make statements regarding anticipated timing for completion of enrollment in and/or availability of results from our clinical trials, but such predictions are subject to a number of significant assumptions and actual timing may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including patient enrollment rates, length of time needed to prepare raw trial data for analysis and then to review and analyze it, and other factors described above. If we experience delays in the completion of a clinical trial, if a clinical trial is terminated, or if failure to conduct a trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial\u2019s protocol leads to deficient safety and/or efficacy data, the regulatory approval and/or commercial prospects for our product candidate may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials likely will increase our development costs. Further, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials have in the past and may in the future ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we ultimately commercialize a product candidate, the standard of care may have changed or other therapies for the same indications may have been introduced to the market in the interim and may establish a competitive threat to us or diminish the need for our products.\nClinical trials are very expensive, difficult to design and implement, often take many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain.\nClinical development of pharmaceutical products for humans is generally very expensive, takes many years to complete, and failures can occur at any stage of clinical testing. We estimate that clinical development of our product candidate will take several additional years to complete; however, because of the variety of factors that can affect the design, timing and outcome of clinical trials, we are unable to estimate the exact funds required to complete research and development, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize our product candidate. We will need significant additional capital to continue to advance our products as per current business plans.\nFailure at any stage of clinical testing is not uncommon and we may encounter problems that would require additional, unplanned trials or cause us to abandon a clinical development program.\nIn addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, an Independent Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d), a data safety monitoring board, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the trial;\n\u2022\nfailure to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial\u2019s protocol;\n\u2022\ninspection of clinical trial operations or sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues, including adverse side effects; or\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nChanges in governmental regulations and guidance relating to clinical trials may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes, or we may amend trial protocols for other reasons. Amendments may require us to resubmit protocols to IRBs for re-examination and approval or renegotiate terms with CROs, clinical trial sites and investigators, all of which may adversely impact the costs or timing of or our ability to successfully complete a trial.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the regulatory approval process for any investigational new drug, substantial further testing and validation of our primary product candidate and related manufacturing processes may be required, and regulatory approval may be conditioned, delayed, or denied, any of which could delay or prevent us from successfully marketing our primary product candidate and substantially harm our business.\nPharmaceutical products generally are subject to rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical trials and other approval procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Various federal and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or materially influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate U.S. and foreign statutes and regulations is time-consuming and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Molgramostim is currently in Phase 3 clinical testing. The top line results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial, IMPALA, were released by us on June 12, 2019 and did not meet all of the statistical goals and protocol end points. On October 1, 2019, we received a written response from the FDA in connection with a Type C meeting regarding the molgramostim development program for aPAP and results from the IMPALA Phase 3 trial in which the FDA indicated that the data provided in the briefing package for the Type C meeting did not provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety for the treatment of aPAP.\nOn December 23, 2019, the FDA provided communication to us regarding the granting of Breakthrough Therapy designation, a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on clinically significant endpoint(s), for molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP. As such, we have worked with the FDA and EMA and determined the scope and design of an additional Phase 3 trial for the molgramostim development program for the treatment of aPAP, the IMPALA 2 trial. The scope, powering, cost, and timing of IMPALA 2 will require us to expend substantial additional resources. Additional clinical trials, and/or other costly trials, could require us to expend substantial additional resources and could significantly extend the timeline for clinical development prior to market approval.\nSignificant uncertainty exists with respect to the regulatory approval process for any investigational new drug, including molgramostim. Regardless of any guidance the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may provide a drug\u2019s sponsor during its development, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies retain complete discretion in deciding whether to accept a BLA, or the equivalent foreign regulatory approval submission for filing or, if accepted, whether to approve a BLA. There are many components to a BLA or marketing authorization application submission in addition to clinical trial data. For example, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will review the sponsor\u2019s internal systems and processes, as well as those of its CROs, CMOs, and other vendors, related to development of its product candidates, including those pertaining to its clinical studies and manufacturing processes. Before accepting a BLA or the equivalent foreign regulatory approval submission for review or before approving the BLA or its equivalent, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may request that we provide additional information that may require significant resources and time to generate and there is no guarantee that our product candidate will be approved for any indication for which we may apply. The FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may choose not to approve a BLA or its equivalent for a variety of reasons, including a decision related to the safety or efficacy data, manufacturing controls or systems, or for any other issues that the agency may identify related to the development of its product candidates. Even if one or more Phase 3 clinical trials are successful in providing statistically significant evidence of the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may not consider efficacy and safety data from the submitted trials adequate scientific support for a conclusion of effectiveness and/or safety and may require one or more additional Phase 3 or other trials prior to granting marketing approval. If this were to occur, the overall development cost for the product candidate would be substantially greater and competitors may bring products to market before us, which could impair our ability to generate revenues from the product candidate, or even seek approval, if blocked by a competitor\u2019s Orphan Drug exclusivity, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, development of our product candidate and/or regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond our control. For example, U.S. federal government shut-downs or budget sequestrations, such as ones that occurred during January 2018 and December 2018 through January 2019, may result in significant reductions to the FDA\u2019s budget, employees, and operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods, potentially affecting our ability to progress development of our product candidate or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate. Further, regulatory oversight and actions may be disrupted or delayed in regions particularly impacted by COVID-19 if regulators and industry professionals are expending significant and unexpected resources addressing the outbreak.\nEven if the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies grant approvals for a product candidate, the conditions or scope of the approval(s) may limit successful commercialization of the product candidate and impair our ability to generate substantial sales revenue. For example, molgramostim could be approved with restrictions for use only by patients unresponsive to the current standard of care or the FDA may approve label claims with age restrictions and/or treatment duration limitations. They may limit the label of molgramostim to a subset of patients based on a review of which patient groups had the greatest efficacious response in clinical trials. Such label restriction may be undesirable and may limit successful commercialization. The FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may also only grant marketing approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval nonclinical or clinical studies, or subject to warnings or contraindications that limit commercialization. Additionally, even after granting approval, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and recordkeeping for our products will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, and continued compliance with cGMP, GCP, international conference on harmonization regulations, and GLP, which are regulations and guidelines that are enforced by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies for all clinical development and for any clinical studies that we conduct post-approval. The FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may decide to withdraw approval, add warnings, or narrow the approved indications in the product label, or establish risk management programs that could restrict distribution of our products. These actions could result from, among other things, safety concerns, including unexpected side effects or drug interaction problems, or concerns over misuse of a product. If any of these actions were to occur following approval, we may have to discontinue commercialization of the product, limit our sales and marketing efforts, implement risk minimization procedures, and/or conduct post-approval studies, which in turn could result in significant expense and delay or limit our ability to generate sales revenues.\nRegulations may be changed prior to submission of a marketing application that require higher hurdles than currently anticipated. These may occur as a result of drug scandals, recalls, or a political environment unrelated to our products.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our primary product candidate, we may face regulatory difficulties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if initial regulatory approval is obtained, as a condition to the initial approval, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or marketing surveillance programs, any of which would limit the commercial potential of the product. Our molgramostim product candidate also will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements related to the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, record-keeping, and submission of safety and other post-market information regarding the product. For instance, the FDA may require changes to approved drug labels, require post-approval clinical studies, and impose distribution and use restrictions on certain drug products. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are subject to continuing regulatory review and periodic inspections. If previously unknown problems with a product are discovered, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, the FDA may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we or a CMO of ours fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nexclude our product from reimbursement under government healthcare programs, including Medicaid or Medicare;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions or affirmative obligations on our or our CMO\u2019s operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nclose the facilities of a CMO; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIf our primary product candidate receives regulatory approval but fails to achieve significant market acceptance among the medical community, patients, or third-party payers, the revenue we generate from its sales will be limited and our business may never achieve profitability.\nOur success will depend in substantial part on the extent to which our product candidate, if approved, is accepted by the medical community and patients and reimbursed by third-party payers, including government payers. The degree of market acceptance with respect to our approved product, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of our product as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nacceptance in the medical and patient communities of our product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe product\u2019s taste, ease of use, or features associated with the delivery device;\n\u2022\nthe perceived advantages of our product over alternative treatments, including with respect to the incidence and severity of any adverse side effects and the cost of treatment;\n\u2022\nthe indications for which our product is approved;\n\u2022\nclaims or other information (including limitations or warnings) in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\nreimbursement and coverage policies of government and other third-party payers;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness of our product relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nsmaller-than-expected market size due to lack of disease awareness of a rare disease, or the patient population with a specific rare disease being smaller than anticipated;\n\u2022\ninappropriate diagnostic efforts due to limited knowledge and/or resources among clinicians;\n\u2022\ndifficulties identifying patients;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence of off-label substitution of chemically equivalent products or alternative treatments; and\n\u2022\nthe resources we devote to marketing our product and restrictions on promotional claims we can make with respect to the product.\nWe cannot predict with reasonable accuracy whether physicians, patients, healthcare insurers, health maintenance organizations, or the medical community in general, will accept or utilize our product, if approved. If our product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by these parties, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers regarding benefits of our product may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIf we determine that a product candidate may not achieve adequate market acceptance or that the potential market size does not justify additional expenditures on the program, we may reduce our expenditures on the development and/or the process of seeking regulatory approval of the product candidate while we evaluate whether and on what timeline to move the program forward.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our primary product candidate in the U.S., we may never receive approval or commercialize our product outside of the U.S., which would limit our ability to realize the full commercial potential of our primary product candidate.\nIn order to market products outside of the U.S., we must establish and comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries generally differs from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the U.S., as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the U.S. As described above, such effects include the risks that our product candidate may not be approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our product candidate and have an adverse effect on product sales, and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up trials. Conversely, if the product candidate does receive approval outside the U.S. in the future, we may not meet the FDA requirements in the U.S. for approval.\nWe must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Other countries, such as the U.K., have similar laws with which we must comply. We face the risk that an employee or agent could be accused of violating one or more of these laws, particularly in geographies where significant overlap exists between local government and healthcare industries. Such an accusation, even if unwarranted, could prove disruptive to our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success will depend on obtaining and maintaining effective intellectual property protection for our primary product candidate and proprietary technology.\nWe have no patent protection for molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP, and primarily rely on the Orphan Drug exclusivity as our primary barrier to competition. Molgramostim utilizes proprietary delivery devices with exclusive supply agreements and receives additional protection via a proprietary cell bank used in the production of the drug substance.\nOur success will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain exclusivity rights with respect to our products and their uses;\n\u2022\nprevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nmaintain proprietary know-how and trade secrets;\n\u2022\noperate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of others; and\n\u2022\nobtain appropriate licenses to patents or proprietary rights held by third parties if infringement would otherwise occur, or if necessary, to secure exclusive rights to them, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nThe patent and intellectual property positions of biopharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions, and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation. There is no guarantee that we have or will develop or obtain the rights to products or processes that are patentable, that patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect the technology we develop or have developed or that is used by us, our CMOs, or our other service providers. In addition, any patents that are issued to us may be limited in scope or challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented, including by our competitors, and rights we have under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us. If competitors can develop and commercialize technology and products similar to ours, our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nPatent applications in the U.S. are confidential for a period of time until they are published, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months. As a result, we cannot be certain that the inventors listed in any patent or patent application owned by us were the first to conceive of the inventions covered by such patents and patent applications (for U.S. patent applications filed before March 15, 2013), or that such inventors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions outside the U.S. and, after March 15, 2013, in the U.S. In addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and foreign countries may affect our patent rights and limit the number of patents we can obtain, which could permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without any compensation to us.\nWhile we are no longer pursuing the development of our vancomycin program, we hold a patent specific to the formulation of the vancomycin powder. While this may prevent identical products from entering the market, it may not preclude someone skilled in the art from inventing an alternate formulation approach with comparable or improved characteristics.\nWe also rely on unpatented know-how and trade secrets and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, and others. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and certain consultants. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, however, may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of or otherwise protect our proprietary information or prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such misappropriation or infringement. In addition, it is possible that inventions relevant to our business could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us or independently discovered by a competitor.\nWe also intend to rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our product candidate, if approved for commercial sale. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect for our product candidate, if approved, could affect our decision on whether to market the products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our revenue or results of operations. For molgramostim, which is administered via nebulization, we may rely on regulatory exclusivity for the combination of molgramostim and its delivery system. However, there is no assurance that our molgramostim product and its delivery system, if approved, will benefit from this type of market protection.\nWe may rely on trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our molgramostim product, if approved for commercial sale, from the products of our competitors. We intend to seek approval for a new name for molgramostim that meets the FDA\u2019s and foreign regulatory requirements. However, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks, in which case we may expend substantial resources to defend our proposed or approved trademarks and may enter into agreements with third parties that may limit our use of our trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our product, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote significant resources to advertising and marketing these new brands. For example, we filed a trademark for the name \u201cSavara\u201d and were challenged. We decided to terminate the application, but we may revisit such filings at a future date. Further, our competitors may infringe our trademarks or we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nOur success depends on our ability to prevent competitors from duplicating or developing and commercializing equivalent versions of our primary product candidate, but patent protection may be difficult to obtain and any issued claims may be limited.\nPatents may not provide us with significant competitive advantages, because the validity or enforceability of the patents may be challenged and, if instituted, one or more of the challenges may be successful. Patents may be challenged in the U.S. under post-grant review proceedings, inter partes re-examination, ex parte re-examination, or challenges in district court. Patents issued in foreign jurisdictions may be subjected to comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign patent offices, or courts. These proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent. Even if a patent issues and is held valid and enforceable, competitors may be able to design around our patents, such as by using pre-existing or newly developed technology, in which case competitors may not infringe our issued claims and may be able to market and sell products that compete directly with us before and after our patents expire.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We and any future licensors and licensees may not apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of our product candidate at a reasonable cost, in a timely fashion, or at all. We may not have the\nright to control the preparation, filing, and prosecution of some patent applications related to our product candidate or technology. As a result, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with our best interests. It is also possible that we or any future licensors or licensees will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, it is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, assignment, or claim scope. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid or unenforceable. In addition, one or more parties may independently develop similar technologies or methods, duplicate our technologies or methods, or design around the patented aspects of our products, technologies, or methods. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to protect our products, if approved, in ways which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFurthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in and outside of the U.S. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to use our patents to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products or technology, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drugs. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.\nEnforcement of intellectual property rights in certain countries outside the U.S. has been limited or non-existent. Future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many other countries will likely be problematic or unpredictable. Moreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a similar patent in another country. Claim interpretation and infringement laws vary by nation, so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other governmental fees on patents and applications are required to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), and various governmental patent agencies outside of the U.S. in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has been issued. There are situations in which non-compliance can result in decreased patent term adjustment or in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, leading to partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nThird parties may claim that our product, if approved, infringes on their proprietary rights and may challenge the approved use or uses of a product or its patent rights through litigation or administrative proceedings, and defending such actions may be costly and time consuming, divert management attention away from our business, and result in an unfavorable outcome that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability and the ability of our CMOs and component suppliers to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technology without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are or may be developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to publish and issue, there currently may be pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that our product, product candidate, or technology infringe, or that the process of manufacturing our product or any of our respective component materials, or the component materials themselves, infringe, or that the use of our product, product candidate, or technology infringe.\nWe or our CMOs or component material suppliers may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation by a third party alleging that our product, product candidate, and/or technology infringe its patents and/or other intellectual property rights, or that one or more of the processes for manufacturing our product or any of our respective component materials, or the component materials themselves, or the use of our product, product candidate, or technology, infringe its patents and/or other intellectual property rights. If a third-party patent or other intellectual property right is found to cover our product, product candidate, technology, or our uses, or any of the underlying manufacturing processes or components, we could be required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our product or use our technology or method unless we are able to obtain a license to the patent or intellectual property right. A license may not be available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, during litigation, the third-party alleging infringement could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable remedy that could prohibit us from making, using, selling, or importing our product, technology, or method.\nThere generally is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we operate, and the cost of such litigation may be considerable. We can provide no assurance that our product candidate or technology\nwill not infringe patents or rights owned by others, licenses to which might not be available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all. If a third party claims that we or our CMOs or component material suppliers infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, may be expensive and time consuming to litigate and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for infringement, including the potential for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, which we may have to pay if it is determined that the product and/or its use at issue infringes or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product unless the third party licenses its intellectual property rights to us, which it may not be required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from the third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to the third party; and\n\u2022\nredesigning our product or process so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial expense and time.\nThere may be issued or filed claims covering our product, product candidate, or technology or those of our CMOs or component material suppliers or the use of our product, product candidate, or technology. Additionally, such patents may be issued or filed in the future. Because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in the industries in which we operate, there is a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product, product candidate, or technology, or those of our CMOs or component material suppliers, or uses of our product, product candidate, or technology.\nIn the future, it may be necessary for us to enforce our proprietary rights, or to determine the scope, validity, and unenforceability of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights, through litigation or other dispute proceedings, which may be costly, and to the extent we are unsuccessful, adversely affect our rights. In these proceedings, a court or administrative body could determine that our claims, including those related to enforcing patent rights, are not valid or that an alleged infringer has not infringed our rights. The uncertainty resulting from the mere institution and continuation of any patent or other proprietary rights-related litigation or interference proceeding could have a material and adverse effect on our business prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe expect competition in the marketplace for our molgramostim product candidate should it receive regulatory approval.\nMolgramostim has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA. Orphan Drug Designation will provide market exclusivity in the U.S. for seven years and ten years in Europe, but only if (i) molgramostim receives market approval before a competitor using the same active compound for the same indication, (ii) we are able to produce sufficient supply to meet demand in the marketplace, and (iii) another product with the same active ingredient is not deemed clinically superior.\nThe industries in which we operate (biopharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical) are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. Developments by others may render potential application of our molgramostim product candidate in a particular indication obsolete or noncompetitive, even prior to completion of its development and approval for that indication. If successfully developed and approved, we expect our product candidate will face competition. We may not be able to compete successfully against organizations with competitive products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources than us, and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture, market, and distribute products. Many of these companies operate large, well-funded research, development, and commercialization programs, have extensive experience in nonclinical and clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products, and have multiple products that have been approved or are in late-stage development. These advantages may enable them to receive approval from the FDA or any foreign regulatory agency before us and prevent us from competing due to their orphan drug protections. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Furthermore, heightened awareness on the part of academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations of the potential commercial value of their inventions have led them to actively seek to commercialize the technologies they develop, which increases competition for investment in our programs. Competitive products may be more effective, easier to dose, or more effectively marketed and sold than ours, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to healthcare reform measures and reimbursement policies that, if not favorable to our product, could hinder or prevent our product\u2019s commercial success, if our primary product candidate is approved.\nThe unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage and reimbursement could negatively affect the market acceptance of our product candidate and the future revenues we may expect to receive from those products. The commercial success of our product candidate, if approved, will depend on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These challenges to prices may be problematic to us since our products are targeted for a small number of patients (those suffering from orphan diseases) thus requiring us to charge very high prices in order to recover development costs and achieve a profit on our revenue. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, we may not obtain coverage for our products after approval as a benefit under the third-party payers\u2019 plans or, even if we do, the level of coverage or payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved drug products, including coding, coverage, and payment. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payers in the U.S., therefore coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payer will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. Third-party payer reimbursement to providers of our products, if approved, may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure of administering our products or third-party payers may require providers to perform additional patient testing to justify the use of our products. To the extent there is no separate payment for our product(s), there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts.\nThe continuing efforts of governments, private insurance companies, and other organizations to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nour ability to set an appropriate price for our products;\n\u2022\nthe rate and scope of adoption of our products by healthcare providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue or achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nthe future revenue and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers, and collaborators; and\n\u2022\nour access to additional capital.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations establish what we believe are appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our products. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments worldwide and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs, and former President Trump signed four executive orders on July 24, 2020 aimed at bringing down pharmaceutical prices. We expect that federal, state, and local governments in the U.S., as well as in other countries, will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or abroad, could affect prospects for our product candidate or what actions federal, state, or private payers for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidate, especially in light of our plans to price our product candidate at a high level.\nFurthermore, we expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future are unpredictable, and the potential impact on our operations and financial position is uncertain, but may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price we may receive for approved products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products, if approved.\nWe face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product or product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization. In the future, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional or increased product liability insurance coverage and it is uncertain whether such increased or additional insurance coverage can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur business (in particular, the use of our primary product candidate in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval) will expose us to product liability risks. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, or others selling or involved in the use of our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products and loss of revenue;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\ndelays in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\na \u201cclinical hold,\u201d suspension or termination of a clinical trial or amendments to a trial design;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our primary product candidate.\nWe maintain limited product liability insurance for our clinical studies, but our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nWe expect that we will expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our primary product candidate, but we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially acceptable terms or may not be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drug products that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could consume a significant portion of our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price is expected to continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced substantial declines since we announced the top-line results of our IMPALA Phase 3 trial of molgramostim for aPAP on June 12, 2019, and our stock price has been and is expected to continue to be subject to significant volatility and fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, financial markets, and liquidity and availability of capital;\n\u2022\nfailed or inconclusive data results from our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our primary product candidate, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed any financial and development projections that we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nfailure of our primary product candidate, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain our existing third-party license and supply agreements;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our licensors to prosecute, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our primary product candidate;\n\u2022\nany inability to obtain adequate supply of our primary product candidate or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, services, or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nif securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding our business and stock;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our business objectives;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators, and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to the aPAP market generally, including with respect to other products and potential products in such market;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with or influence the demand for our product;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, such as the decline in our stock price, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nIf we fail to satisfy all applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements, including the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which has qualitative and quantitative continued listing requirements, including corporate governance requirements, public float requirements, and a $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. If our common stock trades at closing bid prices below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, or if we are unable to satisfy any of the other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have an adverse effect on the market liquidity of our common stock, decrease the market price of our common stock, result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities, and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations.\nFor example, on November 15, 2019, we received written notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC indicating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). However, on December 10, 2019, we received written notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that because our shares had a closing bid price at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, our stock had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).\nWe will continue to incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nAs a public company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We will also continue to incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nIn March 2020, the SEC amended the definitions of accelerated filer and large accelerated filer to exclude smaller reporting companies that have not yet begun to generate significant revenue. Accordingly, we are changing our status from a smaller reporting company, accelerated filer, to a smaller reporting company, non-accelerated filer, effective for this annual report on Form 10-K. In accordance with the SEC amendments, we no longer require an integrated independent audit of our internal controls under Sarbanes-Oxley 404(b) but will continue to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley 404(a) and (c).\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe expect to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nWe have completed certain transactions that likely have resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limiting the use of our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Sections 381, 382, and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, the corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising from before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitations on use. Additional ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on our net operating loss carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90101, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SVRA"}
