RISK FACTORS\nOur business activities and financial condition are subject to significant risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operation could be adversely affected. This report, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements that may be affected by several risk factors, including those set forth below. The following information summarizes all material risks known to us as of the date of filing this report:\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition, Results of Operation and Cash Flows\nOur results of operations, cash flows and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the market prices of gold, silver, and copper and these prices can be volatile.\nThe profitability of our gold and silver mining operations and the value of our mining properties are directly related to the market price of gold, silver and copper. The price of gold, silver and copper may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock. Historically, the market price of gold and silver has fluctuated significantly and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include supply and demand fundamentals, global or national political or economic conditions, expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold and silver sales and loans by central banks, forward sales by metal producers, accumulation and divestiture by exchange traded funds, and a number of other factors such as industrial and commercial demand. The volatility of mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning or technical expertise can fully eliminate.\nWe derive all of our revenue from the sale of gold and silver and our results of operations will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In the event metal prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of time, our existing producing properties may become uneconomic and we might be unable to develop our undeveloped properties, which may further adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows. An asset impairment charge may also result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our producing properties or the market value of our non-producing properties, including a material diminution in the price of gold and/or silver.\nOur results of operations have been and could in the future be materially and adversely affected by the impairment of assets.\nDuring 2020, the price of gold, as measured by the London PM fix, fluctuated between $1,474 and $2,067 per ounce, while the price of silver fluctuated between $12.00 and $28.90 per ounce. As at March 10, 2021, gold, silver and copper prices were $1,716 per ounce, $25.65 per ounce, and $4.01 per pound, respectively.\nA material reduction in cash flow resulting from the revision of our mine plan and reserve estimate at the Gold Bar mine in Nevada has required reductions in certain operating expenditures for most of 2020 in order to preserve working capital. In light of the working capital reduction, the Company completed 4 equity raises: September 10, 2020, December 31, 2020, January 29, 2021, and February 9, 2021 for gross proceeds of $64.4 million. It also renegotiated its debt facility in 2020 to more favorable repayment terms.\nWe initially established reserves at Gold Bar as of December 31, 2017, and such estimate was updated as of December 31, 2018. As of the date of filing this report, the further updated reserve estimate for the Gold Bar mine was completed and updated report filed on February 22, 2021. The operations are now fully funded including the Company\u2019s newest Froome development project at its Fox Complex in Canada which is expected to reach commercial production in late Q4 of this year.\nWe have incurred substantial losses in recent years and may never return to profitability.\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2020, we have incurred pre-tax losses on an annual basis of $153.7 million, $63.6 million and $47.6 million. As of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit, which includes non-cash impairment charges, was $1.2 billion. In the future, our ability to become profitable will depend on the profitability of the Gold Bar, Black Fox and San Jos\u00e9 mines, our ability to bring the Froome project into production and generate revenue sufficient to cover our costs and expenses, and our ability to advance, sell or otherwise monetize our other properties, including the Los Azules copper project. In pursuit of that objective, we will seek to identify additional mineralization that can be extracted economically at operating and exploration properties. For our non-operating properties that we believe demonstrate economic potential, we need to either develop our properties, locate and enter into agreements with third party operators, or sell the properties. We may suffer significant additional losses in the future and may not be profitable again. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms to develop additional mining operations. In addition, our continued reliance on equity funding will result in continued dilution to our existing shareholders.\nWe have in the past and will likely in the future require significant capital to develop our exploration projects. A significant portion of that funding in the past has come in the form of sales of our common stock. We continue to evaluate capital and development expenditure requirements as well as other options to monetize certain assets in the Company\u2019s portfolio including Los Azules, Grey Fox, Stock and the Fenix Project. If we make a positive decision to develop one or more of these initiatives, the expenditures incurred may significantly exceed our working capital. Our ability to obtain necessary funding, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including the state of the economy, our operating results and applicable commodity prices. We may not be successful in obtaining the required financing to advance our projects or other purposes, on terms that are favorable to us or at all, in which case, our ability to replace reserves and continue operating would be adversely affected. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration or potential development and the possible partial or total loss of our interest in certain properties. Even if we are successful in obtaining additional equity capital, it will result in dilution to existing shareholders.\nOur indebtedness adversely affects our cash flow and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding long term, secured debt with a principal amount of $50.0 million. Repayment of the loan is secured by a lien on certain of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets. This debt requires us to make monthly interest payments and, beginning in August 2022, to begin making monthly principal payments of $2 million for 12 months and a final $26 million payment on August 31, 2023.We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. Even if we have sufficient cash flow to retire the debt, those payments will affect the amount of cash we have available to invest in capital investment, exploration, ongoing operations and other purposes. Payments on our debt may also inhibit our ability to react to changing business conditions.\nAny failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business and financial condition and may require us to sell assets or take other steps to satisfy the debt.\nOur ability to make payments on and/or to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Decreases in precious metal prices, in addition to our ability to execute our mine plans at existing operations, may adversely affect our ability to generate cash flow from operations. If our cash flow and existing capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce our planned capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital, or restructure our debt, and any of these actions, if completed, could adversely affect our business and/or the holders of our securities. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be completed on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness could result in the immediate acceleration of the debt and foreclosure of our assets.\nRestrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions, and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur credit facility contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to:\n\u25cf Pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock;\n\u25cf Borrow additional funds;\n\u25cf Repurchase, redeem, or retire our capital stock;\n\u25cf Make certain loans and investments;\n\u25cf Sell assets;\n\u25cf Enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf Create or assume certain liens on our assets;\n\u25cf Make certain acquisitions; or\n\u25cf Engage in certain other corporate activities.\nAs part of our facility, the debt can be called in certain circumstances, including on demand in the event of a material adverse change in our business or our inability to satisfy certain financial tests on an ongoing basis. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy them in the future. In addition, these requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of potential business opportunities that arise because of the restrictive covenants under our debt agreement. A breach of any of the covenants in our debt agreements could result in a default under the agreement.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could affect our results of operations.\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing- related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our results of operation and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the results of operation and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.\nIf we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in gold and silver prices, we may be subject to significant reductions in price.\nWe do not use hedging transactions with respect to any of our gold and silver production and we do not expect to do so in the future. Accordingly, we may be exposed to more significant price fluctuations if gold and/or silver prices decline. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nEstimates relating to new development projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.\nOur decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. However, the actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:\n\u25cf Changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of mineralized material to be mined and processed;\n\u25cf Changes in input commodity and labor costs;\n\u25cf The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;\n\u25cf Adverse geotechnical conditions;\n\u25cf Availability of an adequate and skilled labor force;\n\u25cf Availability, supply and cost of utilities such as water and power;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf Changes in metals prices; or\n\u25cf Changes in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements.\nOur recent development activities, including Gold Bar and Black Fox, may not result in the expansion or replacement of past production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than\ncurrently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nFor our existing operations, we base our mine plans on geological, metallurgical and engineering assumptions, financial projections and commodity price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with mining operations. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of gold, silver and copper and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks which may increase our costs and affect our results of operation.\nWhile we transact most of our business in U.S. dollars, certain expenses, such as labor, operating supplies, and property and equipment, may be denominated in Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos or Argentine pesos. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar increases costs and the cost of purchasing property and equipment in U.S. dollar terms in Canada, Mexico and Argentina, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows.\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates. Appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a depreciation in non-U.S. dollar currencies results in a loss. We have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We also hold portions of our cash reserves in Canadian, Mexican and Argentine currency.\nOur continuing reclamation obligations at Tonkin, Gold Bar, Black Fox and other Timmins properties, El Gallo, and other properties could require significant additional expenditures.\nWe are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to disturbances on all our properties. In Canada and the United States, we are required to post bonds to ensure performance of our reclamation obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued $34.0 million in estimated reclamation costs for our properties, including $31.8 million covered by surety bonds for projects in the United States and Canada. We have not posted a bond in Mexico as none is required by the current legislation; however, we have recorded a liability based on the estimated amount of our reclamation obligations in that jurisdiction.\nThere is a risk that any surety bond or recorded liability, even if increased based on the analysis and work performed to update the reclamation obligations, could be inadequate to cover the actual costs of reclamation when actually carried out. The satisfaction of bonding requirements and continuing reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital. Further, it is possible that the United States Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) may request that we provide additional long-term financing supported by a long-term trust for an amount that cannot be determined at present. There is a risk that we will be unable to fund any additional bonding requirements or that the surety bonds may no longer be accepted by the governmental agencies as satisfactory reclamation coverage, in which case we would be required to replace the surety bonding with cash, and further, that the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation and bonding requirements to such a degree that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue exploration activities, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows.\nThere is no guarantee that we will declare distributions to shareholders.\nFrom June 2015 to September 2018, we paid a distribution to holders of our common stock on a semi-annual basis. Those distributions were suspended in March 2019. Any determination to reinstate this distribution on our common stock will be based primarily upon covenants in outstanding debt instruments, our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, including for capital expenditures and acquisitions, and our Board of Directors\u2019 determination that the distribution to shareholders is in the best interest of our shareholders and in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the Company.\nRisks Relating to our Operation as a Mining Company\nOur estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated or result in additional impairment charges to our operations.\nUnless otherwise disclosed proven and probable reserves and mineralization figures presented in our filings with securities regulatory authorities, including the SEC, news releases and other public statements that may be made from time to time, are based upon estimates made by both independent and our own internal professionals. Estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are subject to considerable uncertainty and are based, to a large extent, on the prices of gold and silver and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques. These prices and interpretations are subject to change. If we determine that certain of our estimated reserves or mineralized material have become uneconomic, we may be forced to reduce our estimates. Actual production may be significantly less than we expect and such reductions may result in impairment charges such as we experienced in 2020.\nWhen making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development, we rely upon such estimated calculations as to the mineralized material and grades of mineralization on our properties. Until ore is mined and processed, mineralized material and grades of mineralization must be considered as estimates only. We cannot ensure that these estimates will be accurate, or this mineralization can be mined or processed profitably.\nAny material changes in mineral estimates and grades of mineralization may affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and such property\u2019s return on capital. There can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale tests will be recovered in large-scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale. Extended declines in market prices for gold and/or silver may render portions of our mineralization estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability of one or more of our properties. Any material reductions in estimates of mineralization, or of our ability to extract this mineralization, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nInvestors should also be aware that calculations of \u201creserves\u201d differ under SEC reporting standards and those under other international standards, such as Canada. Investors should also be aware that mineralized material may never be converted into reserves. Please also see, CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS-INFORMATION CONCERNING PREPARATION OF RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES.\nWe may be unable to replace gold and silver reserves as they become depleted.\nLike all metal producers, we must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire ore reserves from other parties, as we did in 2017. Such acquisitions are based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. In addition, we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including the ability to permit and comply with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm in advance. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore reserves.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and acquisitions may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nOur acquisitions may not achieve their intended results.\nOur acquisitions subject us to many risks. The Fox Complex acquired in 2017 was a distressed asset which has struggled to produce positive cash flows during its years of operation. We are working to improve the operations but with a small\nreserve base, the success of this operation is dependent upon finding additional mineralization through exploration and there is no guarantee that we will be able to convert this mineralization into mineable reserves. We may discover title defects or adverse environmental or other conditions relating to the properties acquired in the transactions of which we are currently unaware. Environmental, title, and other problems could reduce the value of the properties to us, and, depending on the circumstances, we could have limited or no recourse to the sellers with respect to those problems. We have assumed substantially all of the liabilities associated with acquired properties and would be entitled to indemnification in connection with those liabilities in only limited circumstances, for limited periods and in limited amounts. Potential remedies may not be adequate to cover any liabilities we incur, and such liabilities could be significant.\nWe own our 49% interest in the San Jos\u00e9 mine under the terms of an option and joint venture agreement (\u201cOJVA\u201d), and therefore we are unable to control all aspects of the exploration and development of, and production from, this property.\nOur interest in the San Jos\u00e9 mine is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures. A disagreement between joint venture partners on strategic decisions or how to conduct business efficiently, the inability of joint venture partners to meet their obligations to the joint venture or third parties, or litigation arising between joint venture partners regarding joint venture matters could have a material adverse effect on the viability of our interests held through the joint venture. Since all day-to-day decisions are made by the majority owner of the venture, we are unable to participate in those decisions, including whether and when to pay dividends to the venture partners.\nEven if we are successful in achieving one or more of our strategic initiatives at the project, development at Los Azules presents development challenges that may negatively affect, if not completely negate, the feasibility of development of the property.\nThe Los Azules property is located in a remote location that is currently accessed by 75 miles of dirt road with eight river crossings and two mountain passes above 13,451 feet. Even assuming that technical difficulties associated with this remote location can be overcome, the significant capital costs required to develop the project may make the project uneconomical. If the long term price of copper were to decrease significantly below the current price or capital cost estimates increase significantly, Los Azules may not be feasible for development, and we may have to write-off the remaining carrying value of the asset. Furthermore, the project\u2019s economic feasibility has not yet been demonstrated through a full feasibility study. The Preliminary Economic Assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) is preliminary in nature, includes NI 43-101 mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would allow them to be categorized as mineral reserves either under Guide 7 or NI 43-101, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.\nWe may acquire additional exploration-stage properties on which reserves may never be discovered.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire additional exploration-stage properties. There can be no assurance that we have or will be able to complete the acquisition of such properties at reasonable prices or on favorable terms and that reserves will be identified on any properties that we acquire. We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions of additional properties or if reserves are not located on acquired properties. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock or our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses that could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nExploration for and production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization, and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. Few properties that are explored are ultimately advanced to production. Our current exploration efforts are, and future development and mining operations we conduct will be, subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u25cf economically insufficient mineralized material;\n\u25cf fluctuations in production costs that may make mining uneconomical;\n\u25cf availability of labor, contractors, engineers, power, transportation and infrastructure;\n\u25cf labor disputes;\n\u25cf potential delays related to social, public health, and community issues;\n\u25cf negotiations with aboriginal groups or local populations affecting our efforts to explore, develop or produce gold and silver deposits;\n\u25cf unanticipated variations in grade and other geological problems;\n\u25cf environmental hazards;\n\u25cf water conditions;\n\u25cf difficult surface or underground conditions;\n\u25cf metallurgical and other processing problems;\n\u25cf mechanical and equipment performance problems;\n\u25cf industrial accidents, personal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins, landslides and other natural disasters; and\n\u25cf decrease in reserves or mineralized material due to a lower silver, gold or copper price.\nAny of these risks can materially and adversely affect, among other things, the development of properties, production quantities and rates, costs and expenditures, potential revenues and production dates. We currently have no insurance to guard against any of these risks, except in very limited circumstances. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write-down of our investment in these interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent would then not be recoverable.\nOur operations are subject to permitting requirements which could require us to delay, suspend or terminate our operations on our mining properties.\nOur mining operations, including ongoing exploration drilling programs and development efforts, require permits from various state and federal governments, including permits for the use of water and for drilling wells for water. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or on terms that provide us sufficient resources to develop our properties, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain such permits, the time required by the permitting process can be significant. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration of our properties will be adversely affected, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and market price of our securities.\nDue to an increased level of non-governmental organization and aboriginal and local group activity targeting the mining industry, the potential for the government or process instituted by non-governmental organizations, aboriginal and local, to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations may be increased. Any changes in government policies may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations. Future changes in such laws and regulations, if any, may adversely affect our operations, make our operations prohibitively expensive, or prohibit them altogether. If our interests are materially adversely affected as a result of a violation of applicable laws, regulations, or permitting requirements or a change in applicable law or regulations, it would have a significant negative impact on the value of our company and could have a significant impact on our stock price.\nOur operations in Argentina and Mexico are subject to political and social risks.\nWith respect to our affiliated company, Minera Santa Cruz S.A (\u201cMSC\u201d) which owns the San Jos\u00e9 mine, there are risks relating to an uncertain or unpredictable political and economic environment in Argentina, illustrated by the following:\n\u25cf Argentina defaulted on foreign debt repayments and on the repayment on a number of official loans to multinational organizations in 2002 and 2003, and defaulted again on its bonds in 2014.\n\u25cf In 2012, Argentina\u2019s President announced the nationalization of the majority stake of Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina\u2019s largest oil company.\n\u25cf In December 2017, Argentina enacted comprehensive tax reform (Law No. 27,430 (the \u201cLaw\u201d)). Specifically, the Law introduces amendments to tax and other various laws, including a special regime comprising an optional revaluation of assets for income tax purposes. The Law gradually reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% over the period of 2018 to 2020.\n\u25cf In 2018, Argentina\u2019s federal government introduced a decree imposing a temporary tax on all exports from Argentina. The tax was introduced as an emergency measure due to the significant peso devaluation during the year. The estimated impact to MSC is a tax of approximately 7.5% of revenue.\n\u25cf In September 2019, Argentine authorities implemented new foreign exchange regulations which impact the results of MSC. The main restrictions include, but are not limited to, full repatriation of proceeds of exports in cash and bank savings to be denominated only in Argentine pesos and authorization from Argentina Central Bank being required for dividend distributions abroad and intercompany loan payments.\n\u25cf In October 2019, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and former president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner were elected to office. The prior president, Mr. Mauricio Macri, who assumed office in December 2015, implemented several significant economic and policy reforms, including reforms related to foreign exchange and trade, fiscal policy, labor laws and tax rules. The fiscal, monetary and currency adjustments undertaken by the Macri administration subdued growth in the short-term, and some measures, including the export tax, have negatively impacted Argentina sourced revenues. There remains uncertainty about changes that may be adopted by the new administration and their impact on the Argentina economy and our business.\n\u25cf In December 2019, the Argentina federal government approved a decree delaying the corporate tax rate to change from 30% to 25% to the end of 2021 and extending the temporary export tax introduced in September 2018 to the end of 2021. Furthermore, the decree suspended the increase in the dividend withholding tax from 7% to 13% until January 2021.\n\u25cf In 2020, the Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez administration marked its first year in office, a year in which it faced numerous challenges including renegotiating Argentina\u2019s foreign debt, managing currency crises, and, most difficult, designing Argentina\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith respect to the El Gallo Project in Mexico, there has been an ongoing level of violence and crime relating to drug cartels and gangs in Sinaloa State where we operate, and in other regions of Mexico. Our facility at the El Gallo Project was robbed in 2015. On December 17, 2019, the US State Department issued a Level 2 (\u201cincreased caution\u201d) warning with respect to five Mexican states, including Sinaloa State, due to violent crime. These events may disrupt our ability to carry out exploration and mining activities and affect the safety and security of our employees and contractors. On September 8, 2020, the US State Department issued a Level 3 (\u201cReconsider travel\u201d) revaluating travel to Mexico with respect to COVID-19 and warning travel to five Mexican states, including Sinaloa State, due to violent crime. These events may disrupt our ability to carry out exploration and mining activities and affect the safety and security of our employees and contractors.\nOur operations and properties in Canada expose us to additional political risks.\nOur properties in Canada may be of particular interest or sensitivity to one or more interest groups, including aboriginal groups (which are generally referred to as \"First Nations\" and \u201cMetis\u201d groups). We have mineral projects in Ontario that are in areas with an aboriginal presence. It is our practice to work closely with and consult with First Nations in areas in which our projects are located or which could be impacted by our activities. However, there is no assurance that relationships with such groups will be positive. Accordingly, it is possible that our production, exploration or development activities on these properties could be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected in the future by political uncertainty, native land claims entitlements, expropriations of property, changes in applicable law, governmental policies and policies of relevant interest groups, including those of First Nations. Any changes in law or relations or shifts in political conditions may be beyond our control, or we may enter into agreements with First Nations, all of which may adversely affect our business and operations and if significant, may result in the impairment or loss of mineral concessions or other mineral rights, or may make it impossible to continue our mineral production, exploration or development activities in the applicable area, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur operations face substantial regulation of health and safety.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations governing worker health and safety across our projects and our failure to comply with applicable legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under local mining regulations. If inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures.\nIn addition to potential government restrictions and regulatory fines, penalties or sanctions, our ability to operate (including the effect of any impact on our workforce) and thus, our results of operations and our financial position (including because of potential related fines and sanctions), could be adversely affected by accidents, injuries, fatalities or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.\nReform of the General Mining Law in the United States could adversely affect our results of operations.\nPeriodically, members of the U.S. Congress have introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the General Mining Law of 1872, which governs the unpatented claims that we control with respect to our U.S. properties. One such amendment has become law and has imposed a moratorium on the patenting of mining claims, which reduced the security of title provided by unpatented claims such as those on our U.S. properties. If additional legislation is enacted, it could substantially increase the cost of holding unpatented mining claims by requiring payment of royalties, and could significantly impair our ability to develop mineral estimates on unpatented mining claims. Such bills have proposed, among other things, to make permanent the patent moratorium, to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims and to declare certain lands as unsuitable for mining. Although it is impossible to predict at this time what royalties may be imposed in the future, the imposition of such royalties could adversely affect the potential for development of such mining claims, and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims. Passage of such legislation could adversely affect our business.\nTitle to mineral properties can be uncertain, and we may be at risk of loss of ownership of one or more of our properties.\nOur ability to explore and operate our properties depends on the validity of our title to that property. Our U.S. mineral properties include leases of unpatented mining claims, as well as unpatented mining and mill site claims, which we control directly. Unpatented mining claims provide only possessory title and their validity is often subject to contest by third parties or the federal government, which makes the validity of unpatented mining claims uncertain and generally riskier. Similarly, Canadian mineral properties consist of patented and unpatented claims which each have their respective risks and uncertainties. Further, there may be title defects or additional rights which are not recorded on the title. Our concessions in Mexico are subject to continuing government regulation and failure to adhere to such regulations will result in termination of the concession. Similarly, under Argentine Law, failure to comply with applicable conditions may result in the termination of the concession. Uncertainties inherent in mineral properties relate to such things as the sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper posting and marking of boundaries, assessment work and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from public record. We have not obtained title opinions covering our entire property, with the attendant risk that title to some claims, particularly title to undeveloped property, may be defective. There may be valid challenges to the title to our property which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations.\nWe cannot ensure that we will have an adequate supply of water to complete desired exploration or development of our mining properties.\nOur mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in the United States, Mexico and Argentina are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company\u2019s control.\nOur ongoing operations and past mining activities are subject to environmental risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay, suspension or termination of our operations.\nAll aspects of our operations are subject to United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina federal, state and local environmental regulation. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, including cyanide. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for us and our officers, directors and employees. Future changes in environmental regulation, if any, may adversely affect our operations, make our operations prohibitively expensive, or prohibit them altogether. Environmental hazards may exist on our properties that are unknown to us at the present and that have been caused by us, or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally. We utilize explosives in our business, which could cause injury to our personnel, and damage to our equipment or assets. Mining properties from the companies we have acquired may cause us to be liable for remediating any damage that those companies may have caused. The liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the payment of fines and penalties. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permitting requirements may also result in enforcement actions thereunder,\nincluding orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities, causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions.\nOur industry is highly competitive, attractive mineral lands are scarce, and we may not be able to obtain quality properties.\nWe compete with many companies in the mining industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim staking, lease or acquisition in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas which would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable to us due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources. Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such properties. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious metals, but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world-wide basis. Such competition may result in our Company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors, including specifically our operations at the Gold Bar and Black Fox mines. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u25cf Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n\u25cf The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u25cf Reduced control and oversight over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u25cf Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u25cf Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u25cf Failure of a contractor to comply with our standards and policies, as well as with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u25cf Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other related employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could potentially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nIf our employees or contractors engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, we could experience business disruptions and/or increased costs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, a number of our employees were represented by different trade unions and work councils which subject us to employment arrangements very similar to collective bargaining agreements. Further, most of our employees are based in foreign locations. The laws of certain foreign countries may place restrictions on our ability to take certain employee-related actions or require that we conduct additional negotiations with trade unions, works councils or other governmental authorities before we can take such actions.\nIf the employees or contractors at the Gold Bar, Mexico, or San Jos\u00e9 mines were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. Such disruption could interfere with our business operations and could lead to decreased productivity, increased labor costs, and lost revenue.\nWe may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or other employment arrangements when the current ones expire. Furthermore, future labor negotiations could result in significant increases in our labor costs. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating and capital costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProducing gold is an energy-intensive business, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. We utilize electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, and natural gas to produce metal.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u201cUNFCC\u201d) held in Paris in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted which was intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020. The Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016 when countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions ratified the agreement. While there are no immediate impacts to business from the Paris Agreement, the goal of limiting global warming to \u201cwell below 2o C\u201d will be taken up at national levels.\nSome of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an endangerment finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act that current and projected concentrations of certain mixed greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare. Additionally, the United States and China signed a bilateral agreement in November 2014 that committed the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by the year 2025. The EPA in August 2015 issued final rules for the Clean Power Plan under Section 111 (d) of the Clean Air Act designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at electric utilities in line with reductions planned for the compliance with the Paris Agreement. On June 19, 2019, the EPA as part of a regulatory review repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule which eliminates most of the emission reduction standards included in the Clean Power Plan. That rule is now the subject of challenges in the courts.\nLegislation and increased regulation and requirements regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nA small number of existing shareholders own a significant portion of McEwen Mining common stock, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote.\nAs of March 10, 2021, Mr. McEwen beneficially owned approximately 18% of the 459.2 million shares of McEwen Mining common stock outstanding. Under our Articles of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Colorado, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present is generally required to approve most shareholder action. As a result, Mr. McEwen will be able to significantly influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or proposed mergers, acquisitions or other significant corporate transactions.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment.\nIn addition to other risk factors identified herein and to volatility associated with equity securities in general, the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf Changes in the worldwide price for gold, silver and/or copper;\n\u25cf Disappointing results from our exploration or production efforts;\n\u25cf Producing at rates lower than those targeted;\n\u25cf Political and regulatory risks;\n\u25cf Weather conditions, including both unusually heavy rains and unusually light rains or drought;\n\u25cf Failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u25cf Decline in demand for our common stock;\n\u25cf Downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u25cf Technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u25cf Investor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u25cf Disruption of supply and demand and other economic factors due to virus and other disease;\n\u25cf Actions by government central banks; and\n\u25cf General economic trends.\nStock markets in general have in the past and may in the future experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Adverse price fluctuations may lead to threatened or actual delisting of our common stock from the NYSE. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares at a desired price.\nThe future issuances of our common stock will dilute current shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nUnder certain circumstances, our board of directors has the authority to authorize the offer and sale of additional securities without the vote of or notice to existing shareholders. We may issue equity in the future in connection with capital formation, acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. Based on the need for additional capital to fund expected growth, it is likely that we will issue additional securities to provide such capital and that such additional issuances may involve a significant number of shares of our common stock. Issuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage interest of existing shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common stock and any other outstanding securities. Furthermore, the sale of a significant amount of our common stock by any selling security holders, including Mr. McEwen, may depress the price of our common stock. As a result, you may lose all or a portion of your investment.\nGeneral Risks\nThe Coronavirus pandemic could result in adverse operating results due to workforce reductions, supply and/or demand interruptions and travel restrictions.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic. During late March and early April, our operations were disrupted by temporary shutdowns to protect our workforce from the spread of the virus. During the shutdown periods, rigorous policies and procedures were implemented at each site to minimize potential health and safety risks to our workforce. Though we have resumed operations at all our mine sites, the disruption in operations continue to adversely impact cash flows and liquidity and are expected to continue to have adverse consequences to us beyond 2020. Due to slowed ramp up in production and sales, our liquidity and financial condition have been adversely affected and we are at an increased risk of not having sufficient cash flow to fund our operations as well as an increased risk of default under our debt agreement. Achieving and maintaining normal operating capacity is also dependent on the continued availability and logistical delivery of supplies, which remains out of our control. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related advisories and restrictions and the viability and success of the worldwide vaccination roll out. Management continues to actively monitor the global situation on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce.\nWe do not insure against all risks to which we may be subject in our operations.\nWhile we currently maintain insurance policies to insure against general commercial liability claims and physical assets at our properties in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks associated with our operations. We may also be unable to obtain insurance to cover other risks at economically feasible premiums or at all. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available, or may not be adequate to cover liabilities. We might also become subject to liability for environmental, pollution or other hazards associated with mineral exploration and production including bankruptcy of our refiners or other third party contractors which may not be insured against, which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our property. A significant loss could force us to reduce, temporarily suspend or, in the worst case, terminate our operations.\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices.\nWe depend on certain key personnel, and our success will depend on our continued ability to retain and attract such qualified personnel.\nOur success is dependent on the efforts, abilities and continued service of certain senior officers and key employees and consultants. A number of our key senior officers, employees and consultants have significant experience in the precious metals industry. A loss of service from any one of these individuals may adversely affect our operations, and we may have difficulty or may not be able to locate and hire a suitable replacement.\nWe conduct operations in a number of foreign countries and are exposed to legal, political and social risks associated with those operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue in 2020 was generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond our control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to our business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which we may, directly or indirectly, have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with consumption taxes in Mexico, Argentina, and Canada, income tax refund recovery and collection processes in Mexico and Argentina, changes in US legislation as applicable to foreign operations, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. The right to import and export gold and silver may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, our rights under local law may be less secure in countries where the rule of law is less robust and judicial systems may be susceptible to manipulation or influence from government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.\nAny of these developments could require us to curtail or terminate operations at our mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of consumption taxes or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities, including indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders in our operating locations. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to them will be sufficient in preventing them from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to\nour operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur technologies, systems and networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, theft of property or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations. Although to date we have not experienced any significant cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of such attacks in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nSeveral of our directors and officers are residents outside of the United States, and it may be difficult for shareholders to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such directors or officers.\nSeveral of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such persons\u2019 assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on such directors and officers, or enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such directors and officers, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Consequently, shareholders may be effectively prevented from pursuing remedies against such directors and officers under United States federal securities laws. In addition, shareholders may not be able to commence an action in a Canadian court predicated upon the civil liability provisions under United States federal securities laws. The foregoing risks also apply to those experts identified in this report that are not residents of the United States.\nThe laws of the State of Colorado, our Articles of Incorporation and agreements with certain officers and directors may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits.\nThe laws of the State of Colorado provide that our directors will not be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors of the Company. Our Articles of Incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law, including through stand-alone indemnity agreements. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors which require that we indemnify them against certain liabilities incurred by them in their capacity as such. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.", "PERMNO": 70704, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "MUX"}
