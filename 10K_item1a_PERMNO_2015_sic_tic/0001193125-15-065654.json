{"cik": "20171", "company": "CHUBB CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, profitability, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows and that could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability, financial condition, liquidity or cashflows. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d appearing in this Form 10-K should be read as referring to the Corporation.\nIf our property and casualty loss reserves are insufficient, it could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nThe process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise because it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process. Variations between our loss reserve estimates and the actual emergence of losses could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nA further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to the estimation of our property and casualty loss reserves is presented in the Property and Casualty Insurance - Loss Reserves section of MD&A.\nCyclicality of the property and casualty insurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results.\nThe property and casualty insurance business historically has been cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by intense price competition, relatively low premium rates and less restrictive underwriting standards followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, high premium rates and more selective underwriting standards. We expect this cyclicality to continue. The periods of\nintense price competition, relatively low premium rates and less restrictive underwriting standards in the cycle could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA number of other factors, including many that may be volatile and unpredictable, also can have a significant impact on cyclical trends in the property and casualty insurance industry and the industry\u2019s profitability. These factors include:\n\u2022\na trend of courts granting increasingly larger awards for certain damages;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as the occurrence of man-made disasters (e.g., a terrorist attack);\n\u2022\navailability, price and terms of reinsurance;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the investment environment that affect market prices of and income and returns on investments; and\n\u2022\ninflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by insurance companies.\nWe cannot predict whether or when market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write insurance at appropriate rates, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social, environmental and other conditions change, unexpected or unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these issues may not become apparent for some time after we have written the insurance policies that are affected by such issues. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued. Emerging claim and coverage issues therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCatastrophe losses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a property and casualty insurance holding company, our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural perils, including hurricanes and other windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, tidal waves, severe winter weather and brush fires. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as a terrorist attack. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. It is possible that both the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events will increase.\nThe extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of exposure under our insurance policies in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to relatively small geographic areas. Hurricanes and earthquakes, however, may produce significant damage over larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated.\nWe are exposed to natural and man-made catastrophe risks in both our U.S. and international operations. Catastrophe risks include hurricanes and cyclones along the coastlines of North America, the Caribbean region, Latin America, Asia and Australia. Catastrophe risks also include winter storms, northeasters, thunderstorms, hail storms, tornadoes, flooding and other water damage, earthquakes, other seismic or volcanic eruption, wildfires, and terrorism that may occur in locations inside and outside the United States where we insure properties.\nWe utilize proprietary and third party catastrophe modeling tools to assist us in managing our catastrophe exposures. These models rely on various methodologies and assumptions that are subjective and subject to uncertainty. The methodologies and assumptions also may be changed from time to time by the third party modeling companies. The use of different methodologies or assumptions would result in the models generating substantially different estimations of our catastrophe exposures. Moreover, modeled loss estimates may be materially different from actual results.\nManaging terrorism risks is particularly challenging, given the unpredictability of the targets, the frequency and severity of potential terrorist events, the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance and limited government provided protections. Although we use modeling tools to try to manage our risk aggregations, the estimates generated may be substantially different from the actual results if the event were to occur. In addition, for certain classes of business, insurance for terrorism losses is mandatory so we are not able to exclude terrorism from our policies. The U.S. federal government and the governments of some countries outside the United States provide some assistance for certain terrorist events. This assistance, however, is limited. For example, under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, and most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively TRIA), the U.S. federal government shares the risk of loss arising from certain acts of terrorism, but the program is applicable only to select lines of commercial business and benefits under it are subject to a substantial deductible and other limitations. Our deductible for 2015 is approximately $1.0 billion. Even with government-provided assistance, however limited, and the measures we have taken or may take to mitigate terrorism exposure, the occurrence of a terrorist event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nNatural or man-made catastrophic events could cause claims under our insurance policies to be higher than we anticipated and could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year. Our ability to write new business could also be adversely affected. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. In addition, states and other jurisdictions have from time to time passed legislation that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as legislation limiting insurers\u2019 ability to increase rates and prohibiting insurers from withdrawing from catastrophe-exposed areas.\nAs a result of the foregoing, it is possible that the occurrence of any natural or man-made catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to catastrophes is presented in the Property and Casualty Insurance - Catastrophe Risk Management section of MD&A.\nWe cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, including legal, regulatory and social responses to those conditions, may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe changing climate around the globe has added, and will continue to add, to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters (including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, freezes, other storms and fires) around the world. In response, a number of legal and regulatory measures as well as social initiatives have been introduced in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas and other carbon emissions, which various organizations believe may be one of the chief contributors to global climate change. We cannot predict how legal, regulatory and social responses to concerns about global climate change will impact our business.\nChanging climate conditions could potentially have significant implications for the insurance industry in areas such as risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions. We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions will have on our results of operations or our financial condition. Increases in the frequency or severity of natural catastrophes in the future could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability.\nPayment of obligations under surety bonds could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses. The majority of our surety obligations are intended to be performance-based guarantees. When losses occur, they may be mitigated, at times, by recovery rights to the customer\u2019s assets, contract payments, collateral and bankruptcy recoveries. We have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers. In that regard, we have exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced or may experience deterioration in creditworthiness. If the financial condition of these companies were adversely affected by the economy or otherwise, we may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on pricing and capital models, but actual results could differ materially from the model outputs.\nWe employ various predictive modeling, stochastic modeling and/or forecasting techniques to analyze and estimate loss trends and the risks associated with our assets and liabilities. We utilize the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in making underwriting, pricing, reinsurance and capital decisions. The modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to numerous assumptions, uncertainties and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis. Consequently, modeled results may differ materially from our actual experience. If, based upon these models or otherwise, we under price our products or underestimate the frequency and/or severity of loss events, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. If, based upon these models or otherwise, we over price our products or overestimate the risks we are exposed to, new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure, such as:\n\u2022\nrigorous underwriting;\n\u2022\ncarefully evaluating the terms and conditions of our policies;\n\u2022\nfocusing on our risk aggregations by geographic zone, industry type, credit exposure and other bases; and\n\u2022\nceding reinsurance.\nHowever, there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics and no assurance can be given that an event or series of events will not result in loss levels that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that losses could manifest themselves in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Such a manifestation of losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. These risks may be heightened during difficult economic conditions such as those recently experienced in the United States and elsewhere.\nWe may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all.\nThe P&C Group cedes reinsurance to provide greater diversification of risk and to limit the P&C Group\u2019s maximum net loss arising from large risks or from catastrophic events. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not fully eliminate our obligation to pay claims and we are subject to the credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Consequently, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions that are beyond our control. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain following a period with a large number of major catastrophic events. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us in amounts that we consider sufficient and at rates that we consider acceptable, which would cause us to increase the amount of risk we retain, reduce the amount of business we underwrite or look for alternatives to reinsurance. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings and financial strength ratings could adversely impact the competitive positions of our operating businesses.\nCredit ratings and financial strength ratings can be important factors in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets. There can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. If our credit ratings were downgraded in the future, we could incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital. In addition, a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to sell new products and/or to expand our existing product offerings to new markets.\nOur strategy for enhancing profitable growth includes new product initiatives as well as expanding existing product offerings to new markets. We may not be successful in these efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Even if we are successful, results attributable to these product offerings could be different than we had expected and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are dependent on a distribution network that comprises independent insurance brokers and agents to distribute our products.\nWe generally do not use salaried employees to promote or distribute our insurance products. Instead, we rely on a large number of independent insurance agents and brokers. Accordingly, our business is dependent on the willingness of these agents and brokers to recommend our products to their customers, who may also promote and distribute the products of our competitors. Deterioration in relationships with our agent and broker distribution network or their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors\u2019 products could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIntense competition related to the products we sell could reduce our premium volume or adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete not only with other stock companies but also with mutual companies, other underwriting organizations and alternative risk sharing mechanisms. We compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of financial strength, availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service, including claim adjustment service. We may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. If competition limits our ability to write new or renewal business at adequate rates, our total premiums could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire qualified employees or manage key employee succession and retention.\nThere is significant competition from within the property and casualty insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized knowledge. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts\nand proper conduct of highly-skilled individuals, including our senior executives, many of whom have decades of experience in the insurance industry. See the Executive Officers of the Registrant section of this Form 10-K for more information relating to Chubb\u2019s executive officers. The loss of the services of any of our senior executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct or grow our business.\nFor many of our senior positions, we compete for talent not just with insurance or financial service companies, but with other large companies and other businesses. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our business depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management. As previously disclosed, John D. Finnegan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chubb\u2019s Board of Directors have agreed that Mr. Finnegan will retire from Chubb on December 31, 2016. While we have succession plans for our senior management positions and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior employees, if our succession plans do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework in the United States. Compliance with current and future regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Moreover, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to do business, subject us to fines and penalties and have other adverse effects on our business.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in the United States in which they conduct business. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their shareholders or other investors. The regulation relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, limitations on transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and nonfinancial components of an insurance company\u2019s business. Complying with applicable laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and limit our opportunities for business growth. Failure to comply with, or to obtain, appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business and could subject us to fines and other sanctions.\nVirtually all states in which the P&C Group operates require that we, together with other insurers licensed to do business in such states, bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. In addition, in various states, our insurance subsidiaries must participate in mandatory arrangements to provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. A few states also require us to purchase reinsurance from mandatory reinsurance funds, which can create a credit risk for insurers if such funds are not adequately funded by the state. In addition, in some cases, the existence of a reinsurance fund could affect the prices we can charge for our policies. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce our profitability in any given period and/or limit our ability to grow our business.\nIn recent years, the regulatory framework in the United States has come under increased scrutiny, including scrutiny by federal officials, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies as well as insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. The NAIC has undertaken a Solvency\nModernization Initiative focused on updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulation framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. Among the changes adopted by the NAIC and enacted into law by some states, including Indiana, is implementation of an ORSA rule that requires insurers to measure and share with solvency regulators a summary of their internal assessment of capital needs for the entire holding company group, including non-insurance subsidiaries. The P&C Group will be required to provide a summary of its ORSA to Indiana\u2019s Department of Insurance by the end of 2015. Any proposed or future legislation or regulations, including NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current legal and regulatory requirements and may result in higher costs of compliance or increased capital requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, two federal government bodies, the FIO and the FSOC, were created, which may impact the regulation of insurance. Although the FIO is prohibited from directly regulating the business of insurance, it has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and has limited powers to preempt certain types of state insurance laws. The FIO also can recommend to the FSOC that it designate an insurer a systemically important financial institution posing risks to U.S. financial stability in the event of the insurer\u2019s material financial distress or failure. An insurer so designated by FSOC could be subject to Federal Reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards. While we do not believe the P&C Group or any of its affiliated companies are systemically important financial institutions, it is possible the FSOC could conclude otherwise. If the FSOC were to designate the P&C Group or any of its affiliated companies for supervision by the Federal Reserve, it could place more restrictions on our ability to conduct business and may result in higher costs, increased capital requirements and/or lower profitability. Even if an insurance company is not designated as a systemically important financial institution, it still could be adversely impacted by new rules governing such institutions. For example, non-bank financial institutions may, under certain circumstances, be subject to possible assessment to fund the orderly resolution of a financially distressed systemically important financial institution.\nAlthough the federal government and its regulatory authorities generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives often have an impact on the insurance business in a variety of ways. Current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the P&C Group\u2019s business and the insurance market as a whole include measures concerning terrorism insurance, systemic risk regulation, tort law, natural catastrophes, corporate governance, ergonomics, health care reform, including containment of medical costs, privacy, cyber security practices, e-commerce, international trade, federal regulation of insurance companies and taxation of insurance companies.\nThe P&C Group is subject to regulation and supervision in jurisdictions outside the United States where we do business. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations in these jurisdictions may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Our noncompliance with these laws and regulations also could result in restrictions on our business, subject us to fines or penalties or have other adverse effects.\nInsurers in the P&C Group doing business outside the United States also are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions within which they operate. The extent of insurance regulation varies from country to country. Complying with applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business and limit our opportunities to grow our business. Moreover, failure to comply with all of the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in restrictions on our ability to do business, subject us to fines or penalties or have other adverse effects on our business.\nRegulators in many countries are working with the IAIS to develop global insurance company solvency standards and a framework for group supervision of companies in a holding company system, including noninsurance companies. Some IAIS initiatives are particularly focused on the supervision of internationally active insurance groups, such as the P&C Group. In addition to these IAIS initiatives, the European Union Solvency II directive will require regulated companies, such as the P&C Group\u2019s\nEuropean operations, to meet new requirements in relation to risk and capital management. The European operations of a U.S. parent company could be subject to greater capital and regulatory requirements if the U.S. state-based regulatory system is not deemed \u201cequivalent\u201d to its European counterpart pursuant to Solvency II. Discussions between U.S. representatives and the European Union are ongoing regarding equivalency and/or a mutual recognition for the U.S. system under Solvency II, so we are not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II on the Corporation. The Solvency II directive is currently scheduled to take effect January 1, 2016. Interim measures, however, came into force on January 1, 2014, which require some of the requirements to be met ahead of the January 1, 2016 implementation date, notably the production of an own risk and solvency assessment and regulatory reporting. Some regulators outside the European Union have imposed or are considering imposing similar risk and capital management requirements that could impact the P&C Group\u2019s operations. Such proposed or future legislation and regulation in countries where we operate, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs, increased capital requirements and/or lower profitability.\nThe IAIS, working with the FSB, also has developed a process to designate globally systemically important insurers (G-SII). Although certain insurance groups have been so designated, we do not believe the P&C Group or any of its affiliated companies are G-SIIs, and neither the P&C Group nor its affiliated companies have been designated as a G-SII. It is possible, however, the FSB, in the future, could conclude otherwise. The ramifications of a G-SII designation for the P&C Group or any of its affiliated companies are unknown at this time. It would, however, likely result in greater regulatory scrutiny and could place more restrictions on our ability to conduct business, result in higher costs, increased capital requirements or lower profitability.\nState regulators in the United States and regulatory authorities outside the United States are increasingly coordinating the regulation of multinational insurers. We cannot predict the impact that decisions of these coordinated regulatory efforts will have on our business.\nState regulators in the United States and regulatory authorities outside the United States are increasingly coordinating the regulation of multinational insurers by conducting supervisory colleges. A supervisory college is a forum for key regulators of an insurance group to share information and promote the coordination of supervision of the group. It is intended to facilitate supervision of the group at the group-wide level, as well as to enhance supervision of each of the entities included in the group. In both 2013 and 2014, regulators of the P&C Group conducted a supervisory college for the P&C Group. We cannot predict the impact that decisions of a supervisory college or other coordinated regulatory efforts will have on our business.\nWe are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the United States.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, including in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America. By doing business outside the United States, we are subject to a number of risks, including without limitation, dealing with jurisdictions, especially in emerging markets in Latin America and Asia, that may lack political, financial or social stability and/or a strong legal and regulatory framework, which may make it difficult to do business and comply with local laws and regulations in such jurisdictions. Failure to comply with local laws in a particular jurisdiction or doing business in a country that becomes increasingly unstable could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in that market as well as on our reputation generally.\nAs part of our international operations, we engage in transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation, we attempt to match the currency of the liabilities we incur under insurance policies with assets denominated in the same local currency. However, in the event that we underestimate our exposure, negative movements in the U.S. dollar versus the local currency will exacerbate the impact of the exposure on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, holding local currencies subjects us to the monetary policies and currency controls of the issuing government. The devaluation of a currency we hold or the imposition of controls that prevent the export of such currency could negatively impact our business.\nWe report the results of our international operations on a consolidated basis with our U.S. business. These results are reported in U.S. dollars. A significant portion of the business we write outside the United States, however, is transacted in local currencies. Consequently, fluctuations in the relative value of local currencies in which the policies are written versus the U.S. dollar can mask the underlying trends in our international business.\nThe United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted various laws and regulations that may apply to the business we conduct outside of the United States, including those relating to antibribery and economic sanctions compliance. These laws and regulations often apply not only to our direct activities, but also to those activities we conduct through intermediaries, such as agents, brokers and other business partners. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible that one or more of our employees or intermediaries could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. Such civil penalties, criminal penalties, other sanctions and damage to our business and/or reputation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe inability of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in sufficient amounts would limit our ability to meet our obligations, to pay future dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock.\nAs a holding company, Chubb relies primarily on dividends from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries to meet its obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, to pay dividends to shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. The ability of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, on earnings and on regulatory restrictions. We are subject to regulation by some states as an insurance holding company system. Such regulation generally provides that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. Transfers of assets among affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by, state and other regulatory authorities. The ability of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is also restricted by regulations that set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, that limit investments and that limit dividends to shareholders. These regulations may affect Chubb\u2019s insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to provide Chubb with dividends.\nWe may experience reduced returns or losses on our investments, especially during periods of heightened volatility, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe returns on our investment portfolio may be reduced or we may incur losses as a result of changes in general economic conditions, interest rates, real estate markets, fixed income markets, equity markets, alternative investment markets, credit markets, exchange rates, global capital market conditions and numerous other factors that are beyond our control.\nDuring prolonged periods of low interest rates and investment returns, we may not be able to invest new money generated by our operations or reinvest funds at rates that generate the same level of investment income generated by our existing invested assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, during periods of rising interest rates, the market values of our existing fixed maturity securities will likely decline, which could decrease our book value and result in unrealized and/or realized losses that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe worldwide financial markets experience high levels of volatility during certain periods, which could have an increasingly adverse impact on the U.S. and foreign economies. If the financial market volatility and the resulting negative economic impact are prolonged, they could adversely affect our\ncurrent investment portfolio, make it difficult to determine the value of certain assets in our portfolio and/or make it difficult for us to purchase suitable investments that meet our risk and return criteria. These factors could cause us to realize less than expected returns on invested assets, sell investments for a loss or write off or write down investments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant portion of our investment portfolio is invested in obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (often collectively referred to as municipal bonds). Issuers of municipal bonds can face decreasing revenue and tax bases in economic downturns, which could result in the risk of default or impairment of municipal bonds we hold that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio also includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities. Prolonged stress in the U.S. housing market and/or financial market disruption could adversely impact these investments.\nOur investment portfolio includes securities that may be more volatile than fixed maturity instruments and certain of these instruments may be illiquid.\nOur investment portfolio includes equity securities and private equity limited partnership interests which may experience significant volatility in their investment returns and valuation. Moreover, our private equity limited partnership interests are subject to transfer restrictions and may be illiquid. If the investment returns or value of these investments decline, or if we are unable to dispose of these investments at their carrying value, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges to federal and/or state tax laws could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio.\nA significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of tax exempt securities and we receive certain tax benefits relating to such securities based on current laws and regulations. Our portfolio has also benefited from certain other laws and regulations, including without limitation, tax credits. Federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us and could negatively impact the value of our investment portfolio.\nWe are exposed to credit risk and foreign currency risk in our business operations and in our investment portfolio.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in several areas of our business operations, including, without limitation, credit risk relating to reinsurance, co-sureties on surety bonds, policyholders of certain of our insurance products, independent agents and brokers, issuers of securities, insurers of certain securities and certain other counterparties relating to our investment portfolio.\nWith respect to reinsurance coverages that we have purchased, our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers may be affected by the creditworthiness and willingness of the reinsurers to pay. Although certain reinsurance we have purchased is collateralized, the collateral is exposed to credit risk of the counterparty that has guaranteed an investment return on such collateral.\nIt is customary practice in the surety business for multiple insurers to participate as co-sureties on large surety bonds, meaning that each insurer (each referred to as a co-surety) assumes its proportionate share of the risk and receives a corresponding percentage of the bond premium. Under these arrangements, the co-sureties\u2019 obligations are joint and several. Consequently, if a co-surety defaults on its obligations, the remaining co-surety or co-sureties are obligated to make up the shortfall to the beneficiary of the surety bond even though the non-defaulting co-sureties did not receive the premium for that portion of the risk. Therefore, we are subject to credit risk with respect to the insurers with whom we are co-sureties on surety bonds.\nIn accordance with industry practice, when insureds purchase our insurance products through independent agents and brokers, they generally pay the premiums to the agent or broker, which in turn is required to remit the collected premium to us. In many jurisdictions, we are deemed to have received payment upon the receipt of the payment by the agent or broker, regardless of whether the agent or broker actually remits payment to us. As a result, we assume credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents and brokers.\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk from the issuers and/or guarantors of the securities in the portfolio, other counterparties in certain transactions and, for certain securities, insurers that guarantee specific issuer\u2019s obligations. Defaults by the issuer and, where applicable, an issuer\u2019s guarantor, insurer or other counterparties with regard to any of such investments could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses.\nWe report our financial results in U.S. dollars, but a significant amount of the business we write and expenses we incur outside the United States are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, a substantial portion of our investment portfolio is denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. As a result, changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur exposure to any of the above credit risks and foreign currency risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements may impact the manner in which we present our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission may issue from time to time new accounting and reporting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing standards. These new standards or changes in interpretation, particularly those that specifically apply to insurance company operations, could have an effect on how we report our results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nIf we experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar third party relationships, our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted.\nWe outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. We may do so increasingly in the future. If we fail to develop and implement our outsourcing strategies or our third party providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, reputational damage and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. By utilizing third parties to perform certain business and administrative functions, we may be exposed to greater risk of data security breaches. Any breach of data security could damage our reputation and/or result in monetary damages, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe occurrence of certain events could have a materially adverse effect on our systems and could impact our ability to conduct business effectively.\nOur computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, which we use to conduct our business, interface with and rely upon third party systems. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers.\nIn the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. Even if our employees or third party providers are able to report to work, they might be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our computer, information technology or telecommunication systems were disabled or destroyed.\nOur systems could be subject to physical break-ins, electronic hacking and similar disruptions from unauthorized access or tampering. This may impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in monetary damages and/or damages to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nLoss of sensitive data and other security breaches could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nWe routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to protect this confidential and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with customers, business partners and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information.\nIn addition, we are subject to numerous data privacy laws, such as those enacted by the U.S. federal government, various state governments, the European Union and other jurisdictions in which we do business relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others. A misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. Third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could negatively impact us.\nLike other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, and other cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. To date, we are not aware of any material cyber security breach with respect to our systems or data. We deploy administrative and technical controls designed to reduce the risk associated with these cyber security threats. Such controls may be insufficient to prevent events like physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service and other cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems and those of third parties upon which we may rely. In some cases, such events may not be immediately detected. Such events could compromise our personal, confidential and proprietary information as well as that of our customers and business partners, impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and fines, litigation and monetary and reputational damages. While we maintain cyber insurance providing first party and third party coverages, such insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal and confidential and proprietary information being compromised. As a result, in the event of a material cyber security breach, our results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 59192, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "CB.1"}
