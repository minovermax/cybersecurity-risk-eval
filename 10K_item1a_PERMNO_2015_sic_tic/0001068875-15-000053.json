{"cik": "1068875", "company": "BLUCORA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRISKS COMMON TO ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES\nFuture revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products and services.\nThe online service, software, and e-commerce industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and frequent new product introductions. Our competitors in the Search and Content, Tax Preparation, and E-Commerce segments offer new and enhanced products and services every year. Consequently, customer expectations are constantly changing. We must successfully innovate and develop new products and features to meet evolving customer needs and demands, while continually updating our technology infrastructure. We must devote significant resources to continue to develop our skills, tools, and capabilities in order to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies. Our inability to quickly and effectively innovate our products, services, and infrastructure could harm our business and financial results.\nOur products and services have historically been provided through desktop computers, but the number of people who access similar offerings through mobile devices has increased dramatically in the past few years. We have limited experience to date in mobile platform development, and our existing user experience may not be compelling on this new generation of technology. Given the speed at which new devices and platforms are being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on newly developed devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of new user experience. If we are slow to develop products and services that are compatible with these new devices, particularly if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors, our market share will decline. In addition, such new products and services may not succeed in the marketplace, resulting in lost market share, wasted development costs, and damage to our brands.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities attributed to our businesses, our employees, our vendors, or our partners may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and have an adverse effect on our future financial results. Such damage also would require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands.\nOur website and transaction management software, data center systems, or the systems of third-party co-location facilities and cloud service providers could fail or become unavailable, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of revenues and current or potential customers.\nAny system interruptions that result in the unavailability or unreliability of our websites, transaction processing systems, or network infrastructure could reduce our revenue and impair our ability to properly process transactions. We use both internally developed and third-party systems, including cloud computing and storage systems, for our online services and certain aspects of transaction processing. Some of our systems are relatively new and untested and thus may be subject to failure or unreliability. Any system unavailability or unreliability may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in customer satisfaction, additional expense, or delays in reporting accurate financial information.\nOur data centers and cloud service could be susceptible to damage or disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our Search and Content and E-Commerce businesses rely on third-party co-location facilities and cloud service providers. Although these third party services provide some redundancy, not all of our systems and operations have backup redundancy. Our TaxACT business has a disaster recovery center, but if that primary data center fails and the disaster recovery center does not fully restore the failed environments, our TaxACT business will suffer, particularly if such interruption occurs during the \"tax season.\"\nOur systems and operations, and those of our third-party service providers, could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, earthquakes, other natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, internet breakdown, break-in, human error, software bugs, hardware failures, malicious attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, or other events beyond our control. Such damage or interruption may affect internal and external systems that we rely upon to provide our services, take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, and host other products and services. During the period in which services are unavailable, we will be unable or severely limited in our ability to generate revenues, and we may also be exposed to liability from those third parties to whom we provide services. We could face significant losses\nas a result of these events, and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all potential losses. For these reasons, our business and financial results could be materially harmed if our systems and operations are damaged or interrupted.\nIf the volume of traffic to our infrastructure increases substantially, we must respond in a timely fashion by expanding our systems, which may entail upgrading our technology, transaction processing systems, and network infrastructure. Our ability to support our expansion and upgrade requirements may be constrained due to our business demands or limits of our third-party co-location facility providers and cloud service providers. Due to the number of our customers and the services that we offer, we could experience periodic capacity constraints that may cause temporary unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times and lower levels of customer service, and limit our ability to develop, offer, or release new or enhanced products and services. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our services or we fail to adequately expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases.\nThe security measures we have implemented to secure confidential and personal information may be breached, and such a breach may pose risks to the uninterrupted operation of our systems, expose us to mitigation costs, litigation, investigation and penalties by authorities, claims by persons whose information was disclosed, and damage to our reputation.\nOur networks and those from our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access by hackers, rogue employees or contractors, computer viruses, and other disruptive problems. A person who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary or personal information or cause interruptions in our operations. Unauthorized access to, or abuse of, this information could result in significant harm to our business.\nWe collect and retain certain sensitive personal data. Our TaxACT business collects, uses, and retains large amounts of customer personal and financial information, including information regarding income, family members, credit cards, tax returns, bank accounts, social security numbers, and healthcare. Our Search and Content services receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our website visitors. Subscribers to some of our Search and Content services are required to provide information that may be considered to be personally identifiable or private information. Our E-Commerce business and its partners collect and retain certain information regarding its customers, including certain payment information, purchase information, e-mail addresses, and shipping addresses.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and industry rules relating to the collection, use, and security of user data. We expect regulation in this area to increase. As a result of such new regulation, our current data protection policies and practices may not be sufficient and thus may require modification. New regulations may also impose burdens that may require notification to customers or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers. As our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security, our compliance requirements and costs may increase. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations.\nA major breach of our systems or those of our third-party service providers may have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns. We may detect, or we may receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, vulnerabilities in our servers, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited. In addition, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that can be used to attack our offerings. Although we utilize network and application security measures, internal control measures, and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. Such a security breach may harm our business, customer reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under data privacy regulations.\nWe rely on the infrastructure of the Internet, over which we have no control and the failure of which could substantially undermine our operations.\nThe success of our Search and Content, Tax Preparation, and E-Commerce businesses depends on the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure of the Internet. In particular, we rely on other companies to maintain reliable network systems\nthat provide adequate speed, data capacity, and security. As the Internet continues to experience growth in the number of users, frequency of use, and amount of data transmitted, the segments of the internet infrastructure that we rely on may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. The failure of any parts of the internet infrastructure that we rely on, even for a short period of time, would substantially undermine our operations and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe regularly consider acquisition opportunities, and our financial and operating results may suffer if we are unsuccessful in completing any such acquisitions on favorable terms.\nAn important component of our strategy for future growth is to acquire new technologies and businesses. We may seek to acquire companies or assets that complement our existing businesses. We may also consider acquisitions of companies and assets that are not related to search, content, tax preparation, or e-commerce. We regularly explore such opportunities in the ordinary course of our business, and potential acquisition targets range in size from relatively small to a size comparable to our own, and, therefore, may be material to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no guarantee that any of the opportunities that we evaluate will result in the purchase by us of any business or asset being evaluated, or that, if acquired, we will be able to successfully integrate such acquisition.\nIf we are successful in our pursuit of any acquisition opportunities, we intend to use available cash, debt and/or equity financings, and/or other capital or ownership structures designed to diversify our capital sources and attract a competitive cost of capital, all of which may change our leverage profile. There are a number of factors that impact our ability to succeed in acquiring the companies and assets we identify, including competition for these companies and assets, sometimes from larger or better-funded competitors. As a result, our success in completing acquisitions is not guaranteed. Our expectation is that, to the extent we are successful, any acquisitions will be additive to our business, taking into account potential benefits of diversification or operational synergies. However, these new business additions and acquisitions involve a number of risks and may not achieve our expectations, and, therefore, we could be adversely affected by any such new business additions or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the short or long-term value of any business or technology that we develop or acquire will be equal to the value of the cash and other consideration that we pay or expenses we incur.\nOur financial and operating results may suffer if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions we may complete, and any new businesses or technologies may not be complementary to our current operations or leverage our current infrastructure and operational experience.\nEven if we are successful in identifying and completing acquisitions of new businesses or technologies, the process of integrating such new businesses and technologies involves numerous risks that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or stock price, including:\n\u2022\nexpenses related to the acquisition process, both for consummated and unconsummated transactions, and impairment charges to goodwill and other intangible assets related to certain acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s or other key personnel\u2019s attention from current operations and other business concerns and potential strain on financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business or the ongoing acquired business, including impairment of existing relationships with the employees, distributors, suppliers, or customers of our existing businesses or those of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems, and management and other personnel of acquired companies that result in unanticipated allocation of resources, costs, or delays;\n\u2022\nthe dilutive effect on earnings per share as a result of issuances of stock, incurring operating losses, and the amortization of intangible assets for the acquired business;\n\u2022\nstock volatility due to the perceived value of the acquired business by investors;\n\u2022\nany debt incurred to finance acquisitions would increase costs, may increase volatility in our stock price, and could accelerate a decline in stockholder equity in the event of poor financial performance;\n\u2022\ndiversion of capital from other uses;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in acquiring foreign companies, including risks related to integrating operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and\n\u2022\nadverse outcome of litigation matters or other contingent liabilities assumed in or arising out of the acquisitions.\nDeveloping or acquiring a business or technology, and then integrating it with our other operations, will be complex, time consuming, and expensive. The successful integration of an acquisition requires, among other things, that we: retain key personnel; maintain and support preexisting supplier, distribution, and customer relationships; and integrate accounting and support functions. The complexity of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures and/or industries being combined, may increase the difficulties of integrating an acquired technology or business. If our integration of acquired or internally developed technologies or businesses, including our recent acquisition of the Monoprice business, is not successful, we may experience adverse financial or competitive effects.\nOur stock price has been highly volatile and such volatility may continue.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. Between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014, our closing stock price ranged from $13.12 to $29.82. On February 20, 2015, the closing price of our common stock was $13.33. Our stock price could decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the other risks discussed in this report and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, dispositions, charges, changes in or loss of material contracts and relationships, or other business developments by us, our partners, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the search and content services, tax preparation, or e-commerce markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndisclosures of any accounting issues, such as restatements or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nequity issuances resulting in the dilution of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new regulations or accounting standards; and\n\u2022\nannouncements or publicity relating to litigation or governmental enforcement actions.\nIn addition, the market for technology company securities has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and our stock has been particularly susceptible to such fluctuations. Often, class action litigation has been instituted against companies after periods of volatility in the price of such companies\u2019 stock. We have been defendants in such class action litigation in prior periods and could be subject to future litigation, potentially resulting in substantial cost and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur financial results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline.\nOur financial results have varied on a quarterly basis and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline. Many factors could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationships with Google, Yahoo!, or future significant Search Customers, such as alterations to their policies, policy enforcement, revenue share agreements, or qualitative scoring of traffic we direct to their advertiser networks, any of which may result in a potential or total loss of content we may use or provide to our distribution partners;\n\u2022\nthe loss, termination, or reduction in scope of key search distribution relationships as a result of, for example, distribution partners licensing content directly from our Search Customers or other content providers, or any\nsuspension by our Search Customers (particularly Google) of the right to use or distribute content on the web properties of our distribution partners;\n\u2022\nthe inability of any of our businesses to meet our expectations;\n\u2022\nthe extreme seasonality of our TaxACT business and the resulting large quarterly fluctuations in our revenues;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our strategic initiatives and our ability to implement those initiatives in a cost effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe mix of search services revenue generated by our owned and operated web properties versus our distribution partners\u2019 web properties;\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenues generated by existing businesses, or other businesses we develop or acquire;\n\u2022\nour, and our distribution partners\u2019, ability to attract and retain quality traffic for our search services;\n\u2022\ngains or losses driven by mark to market fair value accounting;\n\u2022\nlitigation expenses and settlement costs;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in finding, negotiating, consummating, and integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\nvariable demand for our services, rapidly evolving technologies and markets, and consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nany restructuring charges we may incur;\n\u2022\nany economic downturn, which may lead to lower online advertising revenue from advertisers on our Search and Content business, lower acceptance rates on premium products and services offered by our Tax Preparation business, and reduced sales for our E-Commerce business;\n\u2022\nnew court rulings, or the adoption of new laws, rules, or regulations, that adversely affect our ability to acquire content and distribute our search services, that adversely affect our tax preparation products and services, or that otherwise increase our potential liability or compliance costs;\n\u2022\nimpairment in the value of long-lived assets or the value of acquired assets, including goodwill, core technology, and acquired contracts and relationships; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in accounting principles or standards or in our accounting treatment of revenues or expenses.\nFor these reasons, among others, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance. Furthermore, our fluctuating operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors and financial results volatility could make us less attractive to investors, either of which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nWe sold $201.25 million of Convertible Senior Notes in 2013, which may impact our financial results, result in the dilution of existing stockholders, and restrict our ability to take advantage of future opportunities.\nIn March 2013, we sold $201.25 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) due 2019. The accounting for the Notes will result in our having to recognize interest expense significantly more than the stated interest rate of the Notes and may result in volatility to our financial results. Upon issuance of the Notes, we were required to establish a separate initial value for the conversion option and bifurcate this value from the value attributable to the balance of the Notes, or the debt component. As a result, for accounting purposes, we were required to treat the Notes as having been issued with a discount to their face principal amount, which is referred to as debt discount. We are accreting the debt discount to interest expense ratably over the term of the Notes, which results in an effective interest rate in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income that is in excess of the stated coupon rate of the Notes. This will reduce our earnings and could adversely affect the price at which our common stock trades, but will have no effect on the amount of cash interest paid to holders or on our cash flows.\nOur intent is to settle conversions of the Notes with cash for the principal amount of the debt and shares of common stock for any related conversion premium. Shares associated with the conversion premium will be included in diluted earnings per share when the average stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Notes and could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share and the price at which our common stock trades.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, and the requirement to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change may adversely affect our financial condition and financial results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If we undergo a fundamental change (as described in the applicable Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of their Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe payment of the interest and the repayment of principal at maturity, conversion, or under a fundamental change will require the use of a substantial amount of our cash. If such cash is not available, we may be required to sell other assets or enter into alternate financing arrangements at terms that may or may not be desirable. The existence of the Notes and the obligations we incurred by issuing them may hinder our ability to take advantage of certain future opportunities, such as engaging in future debt or equity financing activities, which may in turn reduce or impair our ability to acquire new businesses or invest in our existing businesses.\nWe incurred debt in connection with our acquisitions of the Monoprice and TaxACT businesses, and may incur future debt related to other acquisitions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Monoprice, Monoprice incurred debt in November 2013, of which $42.0 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2014. In addition, as part of our acquisition of TaxACT\u2019s business, TaxACT incurred debt, which was refinanced with a new credit agreement on August 30, 2013 and of which $51.9 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Both are non-recourse debts that are guaranteed by Monoprice Holdings, Inc. and TaxACT Holdings, Inc., respectively, both of which are Blucora\u2019s direct subsidiaries. These debts may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing Monoprice\u2019s or TaxACT\u2019s vulnerability to downturns in their businesses, to competitive pressures, and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from Monoprice\u2019s and TaxACT\u2019s operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrequiring cash infusions from Blucora to Monoprice or TaxACT if either or both are unable to meet their payment or other obligations under the applicable credit facilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing our interest payment obligations in the event that interest rates rise dramatically; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.\nThese credit facilities impose restrictions on Monoprice and TaxACT, including restrictions on their ability to create liens on their assets and on our ability to incur indebtedness, and require Monoprice and TaxACT to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Their ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond their control. In addition, these credit facilities include covenants, the breach of which may cause the outstanding indebtedness to be declared immediately due and payable. These debts, and our ability to repay them, may also negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.\nWe or our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future to finance additional acquisitions or for other purposes. Such debt may result in risks similar to those discussed above related to the Monoprice and TaxACT debts or in other risks specific to the credit agreements entered into for those debts.\nExisting cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures.\nAlthough we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, the underlying levels of revenues and expenses that we project may not prove to be accurate. In March 2013, we sold $201.25 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, Monoprice and TaxACT had $42.0 million and $51.9 million outstanding, respectively, under the credit agreements entered into in November 2013 and August 2013, respectively. Servicing these debts will require the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control.\nOur businesses may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we evaluate acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies from time to time. Any such transactions, if completed, may use a significant portion of our cash balances and marketable investments. If we are unable to liquidate our investments when we need liquidity for acquisitions or for other business purposes, we may need to change or postpone such acquisitions or find alternative financing for them. We may seek additional funding through public or private financings, through sales of equity, or through other arrangements. Our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and increased uncertainty in the financial, capital, and credit markets. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable, or delayed in our ability, to develop or enhance our products or services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business.\nIf others claim that our services infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to seek expensive licenses, reengineer our services, engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation, or stop marketing and licensing our services.\nCompanies and individuals with rights relating to the technology and consumer electronics industries have frequently resorted to litigation regarding intellectual property rights. In some cases, the ownership or scope of an entity\u2019s or person\u2019s rights is unclear. In addition, the ownership or scope of such rights may be altered by changes in the legal landscape, such as through developments in U.S. or international intellectual property laws or regulations or through court, agency, or regulatory board decisions. These parties have in the past, and may in the future, make claims against us alleging infringement of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy or publicity rights. Responding to any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention, cause product or service release delays, or require removal or redesigning of our products or services, payment of damages for infringement, or entry into royalty or licensing agreements. Our technology, services, and products may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Our business could suffer if a successful claim of infringement was made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or content, or license the infringed or similar technology or content on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nWe do not regularly conduct patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products or services infringes patents held by third parties. Patent searches may not return every issued patent or patent application that may be deemed relevant to a particular product or service. It is therefore difficult to determine, with any level of certainty, whether a particular product or service may be construed as infringing a current or future U.S. or foreign patent.\nWe rely heavily on our technology and intellectual property, but we may be unable to adequately or cost-effectively protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our business and financial results. We may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, which can be time consuming, expensive, and difficult to predict.\nTo protect our rights in our services and technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. We also rely on laws pertaining to trademarks and domain names to protect the value of our corporate brands and reputation. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services or technology, obtain and use information, marks, or technology that we regard as proprietary, or otherwise violate or infringe our intellectual property rights. In addition, it is possible that others could independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, or if others independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened.\nEffectively policing the unauthorized use of our services and technology is time-consuming and costly, and the steps taken by us may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or other proprietary assets. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective, and unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services, use similar marks or domain names, or obtain and use information, marks, or technology that we regard as proprietary. In some\ncases, the ownership or scope of an entity\u2019s or person\u2019s rights is unclear and may also change over time, including through changes in U.S. or international intellectual property laws or regulations or through court, agency, regulatory board decisions. Our intellectual property may be subject to even greater risk in foreign jurisdictions, as protection is not sought or obtained in every country in which our services and technology are available and it is often more difficult and costly to obtain, register, and enforce our rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of others\u2019 proprietary rights, which are sometimes not clear or may change. Litigation can be time consuming and expensive, and the outcome can be difficult to predict.\nLegislation and regulation may impact our business operations, restrict our opportunities, increase our costs, and create potential liability.\nAll of our businesses are subject to laws and regulations relating to how they conduct their operations, and we anticipate that additional applicable laws and regulations will be enacted in the future. Many of these laws and regulations restrict the operations and opportunities of our businesses and result in compliance costs. In addition, interpretations of these laws and regulations are not always clear, and failure to comply with regulatory board or court interpretations could result in liability. For example, all of our businesses have privacy compliance obligations, and any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) requirements, or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by the FTC or others, including class action litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additional applicable legal and regulatory requirements for each of our businesses are discussed below under the sections of these Risk Factors that are specific to those businesses. It is not possible to predict whether or when additional applicable legislation or regulation may be adopted and certain proposals, if adopted, could materially and adversely affect our business. Our failure or inability to comply with applicable laws and regulations could materially impact our operations and financial results.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. For example, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring us without the consent of our board of directors, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our charter documents that could have an anti-takeover effect include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors into three groups so that directors serve staggered three-year terms, which may make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for super majority approval by stockholders for certain business combinations;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote by stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on stockholders\u2019 ability to call special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ncertain restrictions in our charter on transfers of our common stock designed to preserve our federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d).\nAt our 2009 annual meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that restricts any person or entity from attempting to transfer our stock, without prior permission from the Board of Directors, to the extent that such transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a five-percent stockholder of our stock, or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing five-percent stockholder. This amendment provides that any transfer that violates its provisions shall be null and void and would require the purported transferee to, upon our demand,\ntransfer the shares that exceed the five percent limit to an agent designated by us for the purpose of conducting a sale of such excess shares. This provision in our certificate of incorporation may make the acquisition of Blucora more expensive to the acquirer and could significantly delay, discourage, or prevent third parties from acquiring Blucora without the approval of our board of directors.\nIf there is a change in our ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use our NOLs may be severely limited or potentially eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal NOLs of $570.4 million that will expire primarily between 2020 and 2024. If we were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (defined as a cumulative change of 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning five percent or more of a company\u2019s common stock over a three-year rolling period), then under certain conditions, the amount of NOLs we could use in any one year could be limited to an amount equal to our market capitalization, net of substantial non-business assets, at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long-term tax exempt rate. Our certificate of incorporation imposes certain limited transfer restrictions on our common stock that we expect will assist us in preventing a change of ownership and preserving our NOLs, but there can be no assurance that these restrictions will be sufficient. In addition, other restrictions on our ability to use the NOLs may be triggered by a merger or acquisition, depending on the structure of such a transaction. It is our intention to limit the potential impact of these restrictions, but there can be no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. If we are unable to use our NOLs before they expire, or if the use of this tax benefit is severely limited or eliminated, there could be a material reduction in the amount of after-tax income and cash flow from operations, and it could have an effect on our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees, including our key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain, and motivate highly skilled management, technical, sales and marketing, and corporate development personnel. Qualified personnel with experience relevant to our businesses are scarce and competition to recruit them is intense. If we fail to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of highly qualified employees, we may have difficulties in supporting or expanding our businesses. Realignments of resources, reductions in workforce, or other operational decisions have created and could continue to create an unstable work environment and may have a negative effect on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate employees.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key employees. Changes of management or key employees may disrupt operations, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results or delay achievement of our business objectives. In addition, if we lose the services of one or more key employees and are unable to recruit and retain a suitable successor, we may not be able to successfully and timely manage our business or achieve our business objectives. For example, the success of our Search and Content business is partially dependent on key personnel who have long-term relationships with our Search Customers and distribution partners. There can be no assurance that any retention program we initiate will be successful at retaining employees, including key employees.\nLike many technology companies, we use stock options, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards to recruit and retain senior level employees. With respect to those employees to whom we issue such equity-based awards, we face a significant challenge in retaining them if the value of equity-based awards in aggregate or individually is either not deemed by the employee to be substantial enough or deemed so substantial that the employee leaves after their equity-based awards vest. If our stock price does not increase significantly above the exercise prices of our options, we may need to issue new equity-based awards in order to motivate and retain our executives. We may undertake or seek stockholder approval to undertake other equity-based programs to retain our employees, which may be viewed as dilutive to our stockholders or may increase our compensation costs. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any such programs, or any other incentive programs, we undertake will be successful in motivating and retaining our employees.\nRestructuring and streamlining our business, including implementing reductions in workforce, discretionary spending, and other expense reductions, may harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future find it advisable to take measures to streamline operations and reduce expenses, including, without limitation, reducing our workforce or discontinuing products or businesses. Such measures may place significant strains on our management and employees, and could impair our development, marketing, sales, and customer support efforts. We may also incur liabilities from these measures, including liabilities from early termination or assignment of contracts, potential failure to meet obligations due to loss of employees or resources, and resulting litigation. Such effects from restructuring and streamlining could have a negative impact on our business and financial results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SEARCH AND CONTENT BUSINESS\nThe current challenges in the search business may continue.\nOur Search and Content business faced significant challenges in 2014, resulting in a significant decline in financial results for this business as compared to the prior year. These challenges included the impacts of a technology change, changes to our mobile advertising offering as a result of the renewal of the agreement with Google in 2014, and suspended or limited access to our services for certain distribution partners due to regular monitoring of policy and compliance requirements. Although we have addressed, to varying degrees, some of the challenges that initially caused this slowdown, we have been unable to stabilize all of these challenges, and additional issues have emerged, leading to continued and significant pressure on our Search and Content business. In addition, we were unable to accurately predict the long-term impact of some these challenges in 2014, and we may be unable to accurately predict the long-term impact going forward. If we are unable to successfully address our current challenges, or if new issues emerge, we are likely to see a continued material adverse effect on our Search and Content business and its financial results.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the search market.\nWe face intense competition in the search market. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, more developed infrastructures, greater brand recognition, better access to vendors, or more established relationships in the industry than we have. Our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies, develop and expand their product and service offerings more rapidly, adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in content provider and distribution partner requirements more quickly, achieve greater economies of scale, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can. Some of the companies that we compete with in the search market are currently Search Customers of ours, the loss of any of which could harm our business. In addition, we may face increasing competition for search market share from new search startups, mobile search providers, and social media sites and applications. If we are unable to match or exceed our competitors\u2019 marketing reach and customer service experience, our business may not be successful. Because of these competitive factors and due to our relatively small size and financial resources, we may be unable to compete successfully in the search market and, to the extent that these competitive factors apply to other markets that we pursue, in such other markets.\nMost of our search services revenue is attributable to Google, and the loss of, or a payment dispute with, Google or any other significant Search Customer would harm our business and financial results.\nIf Google, Yahoo!, or any future significant Search Customer were to substantially reduce or eliminate the content it provides to us or to our distribution partners, our business results could materially suffer if we are unable to establish and maintain new Search Customer relationships, or expand our remaining Search Customer relationships, to replace the lost or disputed revenue. Google accounted for approximately 45% of our total Company revenues in 2014. Yahoo! remains an important partner and contributes to our value proposition as a metasearch provider, but Yahoo! is currently a much less significant source of revenue than Google. Although we believe that if our Google relationship ended or was impaired, we could replace a portion of the lost revenue with revenue from Yahoo! or other potential content providers, because of Google's position as the overwhelming market leader in the search industry, these two Search Customers are not interchangeable. In addition, Yahoo! has entered into an agreement with Microsoft\u2019s Bing search service, under which Bing provides all of Yahoo!\u2019s algorithmic search results and some of its paid listings. If Yahoo! cannot maintain an agreement with Bing on favorable terms, or if Bing is unable to adequately perform its obligations to Yahoo!, then Yahoo!\u2019s ability to provide us with algorithmic and paid listings may be impaired. In addition, if a Search Customer is unwilling to pay us amounts that it owes us, or if it disputes amounts it owes us or has previously paid to us for any reason (including for the reasons described in the risk factors below), our business and financial results could materially suffer.\nThe success of our search business depends on our ability to negotiate extensions of our Search Customer agreements on favorable terms. We recently renewed our agreement with Google, which now runs to March 31, 2017. Our agreement with Yahoo! also recently renewed and now runs to December 31, 2015. If we cannot negotiate extensions of our current agreements or new agreements on favorable terms (including revenue share rates, our continued ability to offer combined search results or advertisements from different partners as part of our metasearch service, and other operational aspects of our search services), the financial results of our search business will suffer.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete in the search market as the market shifts to mobile search.\nOur search business, and that of most of our distribution partners, is primarily based on searches conducted from browsers and other applications on desktop and laptop computers. As mobile phones, tablets, and other mobile devices increase in popularity, functionality, and usage, mobile searches will constitute an increasing percentage of the search market. Because our search business has been primarily focused on the desktop and laptop markets, we may have less experience and capability in offering and monetizing mobile search services than our competitors. In addition, because we rely on our Search Customers to provide us with search results and advertisements, our ability to innovate for mobile search and to expand in that market is dependent on the cooperation of, and collaboration with, those Search Customers. Under the terms of our current agreement with Google, which took effect on April 1, 2014, Google was no longer obligated to provide us with AdSense for Search advertisements on our mobile search services, and this change required us to increase usage of our other current advertising solutions for mobile and/or find additional mobile advertising solutions and partners. Although we recently executed an amendment to our agreement with Google that allows a broader implementation of mobile search advertisements, that agreement provides a revenue share rate that is significantly lower than the revenue share rate for desktop advertisements and is thus likely to have a limited impact. If we cannot develop services and partners that allow us to sufficiently innovate for the mobile search market and if our mobile advertising solutions monetize at a significantly lower level than our desktop advertising solutions, our ability to participate in the market shift to mobile search will be impaired, which will likely have a material adverse effect on our search business and its financial results.\nFailure by us or our search distribution partners to comply with the policies promulgated by Google and Yahoo! may cause that Search Customer to temporarily or permanently suspend the use of its content or terminate its agreement with us, or may require us to modify or terminate certain distribution relationships.\nIf we or our search distribution partners fail to meet the policies promulgated by Google or Yahoo! for the use of their content, we may not be able to continue to use their content or provide the content to such distribution partners. Our agreements with Google and Yahoo! give them the ability to suspend the use and the distribution of their content for non-compliance with their requirements and policies and, in the case of breaches of certain other provisions of their agreements, to terminate their agreements with us immediately, regardless of whether such breaches could be cured. The terms of the Search Customer agreements with Google and Yahoo! and the related requirements and policies are also subject to differing interpretations by the parties, and we have experienced situations, both in the past and in recent periods, in which our interpretation substantially differs from that of our Search Customers. In addition, Google and Yahoo! have broad discretion, at any time, to unilaterally revise their existing requirements and policies, to implement new requirements and policies, or to change their interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements and policies. Such revisions, implementations, or changes may prohibit or severely restrict certain business methods used by our search business or those of our distribution partners, and the resulting impact could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nGoogle and Yahoo! have suspended, both in the past and in recent periods, their content provided to our websites and the websites of our distribution partners, often without notice, when they believe that we or our distribution partners are not in compliance with their policies or are in breach of the terms of their agreements. During such suspensions, which could occur again in the future, we will not receive any revenue from any property of ours or a distribution partner that is affected by the suspended content, and the loss of such revenue could harm our business and financial results.\nRestrictions on our ability, and the ability of our search distribution partners, to distribute, market, or offer search-related applications, products, and services may impact our financial results.\nA significant portion of our Search and Content revenue is dependent on business models that can be negatively impacted by changes in policies, requirements, or technology. For example, many of our search distribution partners distribute applications, extensions, or toolbars that are monetized through the search services that we provide. Our Search Customers require that such applications, extensions, or toolbars, and the distribution of those applications, extensions, or toolbars, comply with certain policies, and recent modifications of these policies have impacted the distribution of applications, extensions, or toolbars that drive traffic and revenue to our search services, and future changes may further restrict such traffic and revenue. In addition, changes to our Search Customers\u2019 policies, and their interpretations or application of those policies, have previously negatively affected our ability, and the ability of our search distribution partners, to drive traffic to our search services through the use of online marketing, and similar changes in the future could further restrict or eliminate certain online marketing practices used by our owned and operated sites and those of our distribution partners.\nFurther, certain third parties have introduced, and can be expected to continue to introduce, new or updated technologies, applications, and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access our search services or those of our search distribution partners. For example third parties have introduced technologies and applications (including new and enhanced\nweb browsers) that prevent users from downloading the extensions or toolbars provided by some of our search partners. Those applications may also have features and policies that interfere with the functionality of search boxes embedded within extensions and toolbars and with the maintenance of home page and other settings previously selected by users. In addition, our Search Customers can require us to make technology changes to our search services that may negatively impact our search business or the businesses of our distribution partners. For example, a required technology change in the first quarter of 2014 resulted in a significant negative impact on the return on our marketing expenditures. Similar changes may be required again in the future.\nAny changes in technologies, applications, and policies that restrict the distribution, marketing, and offering of search-related applications, extensions, toolbars, products, and services could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nA substantial portion of our search services revenue is dependent on our relationships with a small number of distribution partners, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe rely on our relationships with search distribution partners, including Internet service providers, web portals, and software application providers, for distribution of our search services. Approximately 44% of our total revenues for 2014 came from searches conducted by end users on the web properties of our search distribution partners, of which approximately 20% came from searches conducted by end users on the web properties of our top five distribution partners. Our agreements with many of our distribution partners will come up for renewal in 2015, and some of our distributors have the right to immediately terminate their agreements in the event of certain breaches or events. There can be no assurance that these relationships will continue or will be renewed on terms that are as favorable as current terms. In addition, if these larger partners violate our policies or requirements, or those of our Search Customers, we, or our Search Customers, may suspend or limit their access to our search services. We lost some of our larger distribution partners in 2014 and early 2015, either due to competition from other content providers, including our Search Customers, or due to inability of those partners to successfully adapt to changes in the marketplace or in Search Customer policies. If we are unable to maintain relationships with our distribution partners on favorable terms, or if our distribution partners cannot continue to use our search services, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant percentage of our Search and Content business\u2019s revenue is generated by our distribution partner network. Given the nature of our relationships with our distribution partners, we have limited insight into the methods that our partners use to drive search traffic, which may result in unanticipated volatility in our financial results.\nWe operate a distribution partner network of approximately 100 distribution partners, which generates the majority of our Search and Content revenue. We have contractual relationships with each partner in the network, but many of these relationships are not exclusive and may not provide us with the ability to have full insight into the methods that our partners use to drive search traffic or their business models. As a result, partners can vary their traffic serviced by our search services, and we may not be able to foresee or control this variation. Additionally, our ability to grow our revenue depends on both our ability to attract new distribution partners and retain existing distribution partners and on our partners\u2019 ability to acquire and retain new users that use our search services. For example, a distribution partner may increase or decrease marketing initiatives in ways that we did not predict, and if that partner\u2019s traffic is significantly correlated to marketing, such increase or decrease in marketing may result in a significant increase or decrease in search traffic. Without full insight into a partner\u2019s business model and related revenue drivers, our ability to accurately predict the traffic driven and revenue generated by that partner is limited, in part, to historical patterns. The historical revenue patterns of partners may not be consistent with actual and forecasted results due to unknown factors that impact the partner\u2019s business model and/or any related changes to such model.\nIf advertisers or our Search Customers perceive that they are not receiving quality traffic through our search services, they may reduce or eliminate their advertising through our services, withhold payment for such traffic, or restrict the traffic provided through our services, each of which could have a negative material impact on our business and financial results.\nMost of our revenue from our search business is based on the number of clicks on paid listings that are served on our web properties or those of our distribution partners. Each time a user clicks on a paid search result, the Search Customer that provided the paid search result receives a fee from the advertiser who paid for the click and the Search Customer pays us a portion of that fee. If the click originated from one of our distribution partners\u2019 web properties, we share a portion of the fee we receive with such partner. If an advertiser receives what it perceives to be poor quality traffic, meaning that the advertiser\u2019s objectives are not met for a sufficient percentage of clicks for which it pays, the advertiser may reduce or eliminate its advertisements through the Search Customer that provided the commercial search result to us. This leads to a loss of revenue for our Search Customers and consequently lower fees paid to us. Also, if a Search Customer perceives that the traffic\noriginating from one of our web properties or the web property of a distribution partner is of poor quality, the Search Customer may discount the amount it charged all advertisers whose paid click advertisements appeared on such website or web property, and accordingly may reduce the amount it pays us. The Search Customer may also suspend or terminate our ability to provide its content through such websites or web properties if such activities are not modified to satisfy the Search Customer\u2019s concerns.\nPoor quality traffic may be a result of invalid click activity. Such invalid click activity occurs, for example, when a person or automated click generation program clicks on a commercial search result to generate fees for the web property displaying the commercial search result rather than to view the webpage underlying the commercial search result. Some of this invalid click activity is referred to as \"click fraud.\" When such invalid click activity is detected, the Search Customer may not charge the advertiser or may refund the fee paid by the advertiser for such invalid clicks. If the invalid click activity originated from one of our distribution partners\u2019 web properties or our owned and operated properties, such non-charge or refund of the fees paid by the advertisers in turn reduces the amount of fees the Search Customer pays us. Initiatives we undertake to improve the quality of the traffic that we send to our Search Customers may not be successful and, even if successful, may result in loss of revenue in a given reporting period.\nWe may be subject to liability for our use or distribution of information that we gather or receive from third parties and indemnity protections or insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability.\nOur search services obtain content and commerce information from third parties and link users, either directly through our own websites or indirectly through the web properties of our distribution partners, to third-party webpages and content in response to search queries and other requests. These services could expose us to legal liability from claims relating to such third-party content and sites, the manner in which these services are distributed and displayed by us or our distribution partners, or how the content provided by our Search Customers was obtained or provided by our Search Customers. This could subject us to legal liability for such things as defamation, negligence, intellectual property infringement, violation of privacy or publicity rights, and product or service liability, among others. Laws or regulations of certain jurisdictions may also deem some content illegal, which also may expose us to liability. Regardless of the legal merits of any such claims, they could result in costly litigation, be time consuming to defend, and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. If there was a determination that we had violated third-party rights or applicable law, we could incur substantial monetary liability, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements (if available), or be required to change our business practices. We are also subject to laws and regulations, both in the United States and abroad, regarding the collection and use of end user information and search related data. If we do not comply with these laws and regulations, we may be exposed to legal liability.\nAlthough the agreements by which we obtain content contain indemnity provisions, these provisions may not cover a particular claim or type of claim or the party giving the indemnity may not have the financial resources to cover the claim. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover fully the amounts or types of claims that might be made against us. In addition, we may also have an obligation to indemnify and hold harmless certain of our Search Customers or distribution partners from damages they suffer for such violations under our contracts with them. Implementing measures to reduce our exposure to such claims could require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our services. As a result, these claims could result in material harm to our business. Any liability that we incur as a result of content we receive from third parties could harm our financial results.\nGovernmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth, increase our costs of doing business, and create potential liability.\nThe growth and development of the Internet has led to new laws and regulations, as well as the application of existing laws to the Internet, in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Application of these laws can be unclear. For example, it is unclear how many existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses (such as gambling, online auctions, distribution of pharmaceuticals, alcohol, tobacco, firearms, insurance, securities brokerage, or legal services) apply to search services, online advertising, and our business. The costs of complying or failure to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our market (including limiting our ability to distribute our services; conduct targeted advertising; collect, use, or transfer user information; or comply with new data security requirements), expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability, and result in costly and time-consuming litigation. It is impossible to predict whether or when any new legislation may be adopted or existing legislation or regulatory requirements will be deemed applicable to us, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe FTC has recommended that search engine providers delineate paid-ranking search results from non-paid results. To the extent that we are required to modify presentation of search results as a result of specific regulations or requirements that may be issued in the future by the FTC or other state or federal agencies or legislative bodies with respect to the nature of such\ndelineation or other aspects of advertising in connection with search services, revenue from the affected search engines could be negatively impacted. Addressing these regulations may require us to develop additional technology or otherwise expend significant time and expense.\nDue to the nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate Internet transmissions, through data protection laws amongst others, or institute proceedings for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified, and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments (or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws) could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us or force us to change our business practices.\nSome of our Search and Content properties, and those of our distribution partners, depend on search engine traffic to drive revenue, and changes in how search engines display links to those properties can negatively impact traffic to those properties and thus the revenues generated by those properties.\nSome of our properties, particularly our HowStuffWorks content properties, generate a significant amount of their traffic from search engine result pages. Some of our distribution partners also have properties that generate traffic through search engine result pages. Search engines, including our Search Customers, regularly update the algorithms that power their search results. These algorithm changes can affect the placement of our web properties, or those of our partners, on search result pages, and those placement changes can have a significant impact on traffic driven through search engines, with a resulting negative impact on revenues. If we, or our partners, cannot maintain sufficiently high placement on search engine result pages, the business may be negatively impacted.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR TAX PREPARATION BUSINESS\nThe tax preparation market is very competitive, and failure to effectively compete will adversely affect our financial results.\nOur TaxACT business operates in a very competitive marketplace. There are many competing software products and online services, including two competitors who have a significant percentage of the software and online service market: Intuit\u2019s TurboTax and H&R Block\u2019s products and services. Our TaxACT business must also compete with alternate methods of tax preparation, including \"pencil and paper\" do-it-yourself return preparation by individual filers and storefront tax preparation services, including both local tax preparers and large chains such as H&R Block, Liberty, and Jackson Hewitt. Finally, our TaxACT business faces the risk that state or federal taxing agencies will offer software or systems to provide direct access for individual filers that will reduce the need for TaxACT\u2019s software and services. Our financial results will suffer if we cannot continue to offer software and services that have quality and ease-of-use that are compelling to consumers; market the software and services in a cost effective way; offer ancillary services that are attractive to users; and develop the software and services at a low enough cost to be able to offer them at a competitive price point.\nThe seasonality of our Tax Preparation business requires a precise development and release schedule and any delays or issues with accuracy or quality may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results.\nOur tax preparation software and online service must be ready to launch in final form near the beginning of each calendar year to take advantage of the full tax season. We must update the code for our software and service each year to account for annual changes in tax laws and regulations. Delayed and unpredictable changes to federal and state tax laws and regulations can cause an already tight development cycle to become even more challenging. We must develop our code on a precise schedule that both incorporates all such changes and ensures that the software and service are accurate. If we are unable to meet this precise schedule and we launch our software and service late, we risk losing customers to our competitors. If we cannot develop our software with a high degree of accuracy and quality, we risk errors in the tax returns that are generated. Such errors could result in loss of reputation, lower customer retention, or legal fees and payouts related to the warranty on our software and service.\nThe hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data by our TaxACT business create risk that may harm our business.\nOur TaxACT business collects, uses, and retains large amounts of customer personal and financial information, including information regarding income, family members, credit cards, tax returns, bank accounts, social security numbers, and healthcare. Some of this personal customer information is held by third-party vendors that process certain transactions. In addition, as many of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing and will continue to increase as we further evolve our businesses. We and\nour vendors use security technologies to protect transactions and personal information and use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information. However, individuals or third parties, including rogue employees, contractors, temporary workers, vendors, business partners, or hackers, may be able to circumvent these security and business measures. In addition, our clients may access our online tax preparation services from their computers and mobile devices, install and use our tax preparation software on their computers and mobile devices, and access online banking services from their computers and mobile devices. Because our business model relies on our clients\u2019 use of their own personal computers, mobile devices, and the Internet, computer viruses and other attacks on our clients\u2019 personal computer systems and mobile devices could create losses for our clients even without any breach in the security of our systems, and could thereby harm our business and our reputation.\nIf we are unable to develop, manage, and maintain critical third party business relationships for our TaxACT business, it may be adversely affected.\nOur TaxACT business is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and leverage new and existing relationships. We rely on various third party partners, including software and service providers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, contractors, financial institutions, and licensing partners, among others, in many areas of this business to deliver our services and products. In certain instances, the products or services provided through these third party relationships may be difficult to replace or substitute, depending on the level of integration of the third party\u2019s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party\u2019s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services, and technologies or to update their products, services, and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers, and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.\nIn particular, our TaxACT business has relationships with banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, both as customers and as suppliers of certain critical services we offer to our other customers. If any of these institutions fail, consolidate, stop providing certain services, or institute cost-cutting efforts, our results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers.\nWe may be unable to effectively adapt to changing government regulations relating to tax preparation, which may harm our operating results.\nThe tax preparation industry is heavily regulated at the state and federal level, and is frequently subject to significant new and revised laws and regulations. The application of these laws and regulations to our businesses is often unclear and compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes to our business practices. Any changes to our business practices that result from a change to laws or regulations, or from any change in the interpretation of a law or regulation (for example due to a court ruling or an administrative ruling or interpretation), may result in a negative impact on our operating results. We are also required to comply with a variety of IRS and state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in these requirements, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.\nIn order to meet regulatory standards, we may be required to increase investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies. In addition, government authorities may enact other laws, rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations, such as requirements related to data collection, use, transmission, retention, processing and security, which may make our business more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may harm our future financial results.\nRestrictions on our ability to offer certain financial products related to our tax preparation services may harm our financial results.\nWe offer certain financial products related to our tax preparation software and services, and we generate some of our Tax Preparation segment revenue from such products. These products include prepaid debit cards on which a tax filer may receive his or her tax refund and the ability of certain of our users to have the fees for our services deducted from their tax refund. Any regulation of these products by state or federal governments, or any competing products offered by state and federal tax collection agencies could impact our revenue from these financial products. In addition, litigation brought by consumers or state or federal agencies relating to these products may result in additional restrictions on the offering of these products. To the\nextent that any additional restrictions on our tax preparation related financial products restrict our ability to offer such products, our financial results may suffer.\nUnanticipated changes in income tax rates, deduction types, or the taxation structure may adversely affect our TaxACT business.\nChanges in the way that the state and federal governments structure their taxation regimes may affect our results. The introduction of a simplified or flattened taxation structure may make our services less necessary or attractive to individual filers. We also face risk from the possibility of increased complexity in taxation structures, which may encourage some of our customers to seek professional tax advice instead of using our software or services. In the event that such changes to tax structures cause us to lose market share, our results may suffer.\nIf our TaxACT business fails to process transactions effectively or fails to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed.\nOur TaxACT business processes a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that fraudulent activity may affect our services. In addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems may create, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence in our controls may seriously harm our business and damage our brand. The systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable, and timely manner, which may harm our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS\nThe electronics and accessories market is highly competitive, and failure to effectively compete will adversely affect our financial results.\nThe electronics and accessories market in which our Monoprice business sells products is highly competitive. All of Monoprice\u2019s products face competition from many sellers of similar products, some of which are much larger and more well-known than Monoprice. We attempt to offer products that provide similar quality and technology as those offered by our competitors, but at a lower price, and we attempt to do so with customer service and support that equals or exceeds that of many of our competitors. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages over us that may adversely affect our ability to successfully compete on price, quality, technology, service, or support, including larger scale, advanced research facilities, extensive experience in the industry, proprietary intellectual property, greater financial resources, more advanced and extensive supply chain and distribution capacity, better service and support capability, and stronger relationships with suppliers and resellers. If we are unable to successfully compete on price, quality, technology, service, or support, we may not be able to attract and retain customers.\nWe also face competition in attracting the attention of customers in a cost-effective manner. Many of our competitors have better brand recognition, have stronger distribution networks, and spend significantly more than us on marketing efforts. Our financial results depend on our ability to effectively attract customers at a cost that allows us to continue to offer low prices and maintain our margins, and if our efforts are not effective and cost-efficient, our financial results will suffer.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our inventory may either exceed demand or be insufficient to meet demand, which could harm our financial results.\nWe rely on our supplier network to manufacture our products, and as a result, we must forecast demand for our products well in advance of the sale of those products when placing orders from our suppliers. If our orders exceed eventual demand, we will have excess inventory, which will increase our inventory carrying costs, may increase risk that those products will become obsolete prior to sale, and may result in write-offs and/or significant price reductions of that inventory. If our orders are insufficient to meet demand, we may not be able to adequately replace that inventory to meet all customer orders in a timely manner, resulting in back-orders, potential lost sales, and negative customer experiences. Significant failure to accurately forecast customer demand may thus impact our short- and long-term financial results.\nOur ability to be competitive depends on our ability to introduce new and updated products with sufficient speed to satisfy customers and thus maintain and grow our market share.\nThe electronics and accessories market is subject to frequent new product introductions, rapid advancements in technology, changes in industry standards, and evolving consumer preferences. Many of our electronics and accessories have short life cycles and/or must be updated frequently. Our future success depends on our ability to develop, introduce, and deliver on a timely basis, and in sufficient quantity, new products and enhancements to current products. The success of any new product or any update to a current product will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nAccurately predict features that are compelling to customers;\n\u2022\nAcquire or develop technology to incorporate those features in our products;\n\u2022\nEnsure that the design of products is appealing to consumers;\n\u2022\nArrange for the manufacture and delivery of a sufficient amount of the products on a timely and cost-effective basis; and\n\u2022\nEnsure that the products are of sufficient quality to maintain customer satisfaction.\nIf we cannot successfully execute on the above factors, our offerings may not match customer demand, with the result that our inventory may become obsolete, we may not be able to maintain or grow sales, our reputation may suffer, and we may be unable to attract and retain customers.\nOur ability to maintain and grow market share depends on our ability to offer quality products at price well below the average market price for such products.\nWe attempt to offer electronics and accessories at a price below our competitors\u2019 prices for similar products, while still maintaining similar quality. Our ability to continue to offer quality products at lower prices depends on our ability to adequately source such products at sufficient quality, quantity, and cost and on our ability to keep other operating expenses proportionally low. Because prices for electronics and accessories tend to decline over time, our continued success will depend on our ability to offer some of our products at even lower prices in the future and on our ability to identify new products or product categories that we can offer at similar low prices. If we cannot continue to offer current products, and introduce new products, at such quality, quantity, and low cost, we will be unable to maintain or grow our revenues and our financial results will suffer.\nWe depend on international third-party manufacturers to supply our electronics and accessories and risks related to the manufacture and shipping of our products could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe outsource most of the manufacturing of our electronics and accessories to suppliers in Asia. We rely on the performance of these suppliers, and any problems with such performance could result in cost overruns, delayed deliveries, shortages, poor quality control, intellectual property issues (both theft of our intellectual property and infringement by our suppliers of the intellectual property of others), and compliance issues. Performance problems by our suppliers could result from many events, including the following: suppliers\u2019 willful or unintentional breach of supply agreements; their failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; labor unrest at their facilities; civil unrest; natural or human disasters at production or shipping facilities; equipment or other facility failures; their inability to acquire sufficient quantities or qualities of components or raw materials at expected prices; infrastructure problems in their countries (e.g., power or transportation infrastructure problems); their bankruptcy, insolvency, or other financial problems; and requests or requirements by their other customers that may conflict with our requirements. In addition, because most of our products are shipped from Asia, we face risks related to such shipping, including performance failures by our shipping partners and those of our suppliers, natural disasters, shipping equipment failure, and export and import regulation compliance issues. In late 2014 and early 2015, our ability to maintain adequate inventory has been impacted by slowdowns in offloading container ships resulting from labor disputes. These slowdowns may continue, with the result that the impact on our ability to maintain inventory may continue.\nThe performance of our manufacturers, suppliers, and shippers is largely outside of our control. As the result of any performance failures, we may lose sales, or we may be required to adjust product designs, change production schedules, or develop suitable alternative contract manufacturers, suppliers, or shippers, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to our customers and/or increased costs. Any such delays, disruptions, or quality problems could adversely impact our ability to sell our products, harm our reputation, impair our customer relationships, and adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur electronics and accessories could experience quality or safety defects that could result in damage to our reputation, require us to provide replacement products, or cause us to institute product recalls.\nWe expect that all of our electronics and accessories will meet or exceed all applicable standards for quality and safety. We monitor and attempt to address any quality or safety issues during the design and manufacturing processes, but some problems or defects may not be identified until after introduction and shipment of products to consumers. Resolving such problems or defects may result in increased costs related to production and shipment of replacement parts or products, increased customer support requirements, and redesign and manufacture of products. If we are unable to fix defects in a timely manner or adequately address quality control issues, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, our reputation may suffer, and we may lose customers. If the problems or defects result in a significant safety hazard, we may be forced to institute a product recall, resulting in negative publicity, loss of reputation, administrative costs, distraction of personnel from regular duties, and recall, refund, and replacement expenses. In addition, such product recalls may result in disputes with suppliers and customers or lead to adverse proceedings such as arbitration or litigation, which can be costly and expensive.\nProduct liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation.\nAs the seller of consumer products, we face the possibility that there will be claims for losses or injuries caused by some of our products. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of possible defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of coverage or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.\nIf our products or operations, or those of our suppliers fail to comply with domestic and international government regulations, or if these regulations result in restrictions on our business, our results could be negatively impacted.\nOur products and operations, and the operations of our suppliers and partners, must comply with various domestic and international laws, regulations, and standards, which are complicated and subject to interpretation. Failure by us or our partners to comply with existing or evolving laws or regulations, including export and import restrictions and barriers, or to obtain domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates on a timely basis could result in restrictions on our operations or in our inability to obtain or sell certain products, with the result that our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe require that all of our suppliers comply with our design and product content specifications, ethical and human rights requirements, applicable laws (including product safety, security, labor, and environmental laws), and otherwise be certified as meeting our supplier code of conduct. While we do conduct a monitoring program to attempt to ensure compliance by our suppliers, our program cannot ensure 100% compliance. Any failure by our suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct, or with any other applicable standard, law, or regulation, could result in our inability or unwillingness to continue working with that supplier, additional monitor costs, and/or negative publicity and damage to our brand and reputation.", "PERMNO": 86544, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "BCOR"}
