In addition to the other information in this report, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Secondary Life Insurance Business and Industry\nMaterial changes in the secondary life insurance market, a relatively new and evolving market, may adversely affect our operating results, business prospects, the value of our common stock and our ability to repay our debt obligations.\nThe success of our business and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations depends in part on the continued development of the secondary market for life insurance, including the accuracy of actuarial forecasting, the solvency of life insurance companies to pay the face value of the life insurance benefits and the demand for life insurance investments, all of which will critically impact our performance. The life insurance secondary market may be impacted by a variety of factors such as the interpretation of existing laws and regulations (including laws relating to insurable interests), the passage of new legislation and regulations, mortality improvement rates, updated actuarial methodologies, and mortality tables. Importantly, all of the factors that we believe could most significantly affect the life insurance secondary market are beyond our control. Any material and adverse change in the life insurance secondary market could adversely affect our operating results, our access to capital, the value of our common stock, our ability to repay our various debt and other obligations, and our business prospects and viability. Because of this, an investment in our securities involves greater risk as compared to investments offered by companies with more diversified business operations in more established or predictable markets.\nThe valuation of our life insurance policy assets on our balance sheet requires us to make material assumptions that may ultimately prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove incorrect, we could suffer significant losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOne of our principal assets is a portfolio of life insurance policies purchased in the secondary market, comprising approximately 62% and 50% of our total assets, excluding goodwill, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Those assets are considered \u201cLevel 3\u201d fair value measurements under Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d), as there is currently no active market where we are able to observe quoted prices for identical assets. As a result, our determination of \u201cfair value\u201d for those assets on our balance sheet incorporates significant inputs that are not observable. Fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received if assets were sold or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A sale of the portfolio or a portion of the portfolio in an other than orderly transaction would likely occur at less than the fair value of the respective life insurance policies.\nA Level 3 fair value measurement is inherently uncertain and could create additional volatility in our financial statements that is not necessarily related to the performance of our underlying assets. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we estimated the fair value discount rate for our life insurance portfolio to be 8.25%. Life expectancy estimates are also a significant component within our fair value measurement. If in the future we determine that a higher discount rate is required to ascribe fair value to a similarly situated portfolio of life insurance policies or that life expectancy estimates materially differ from actuarial estimates and/or our projections, we could experience significant losses materially affecting our results of operations. In addition, significant losses of this nature would likely at some point cause our common stock to decline in value and cause us to be out of compliance with borrowing covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements. This could in turn result in acceleration of our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, which we may not be able to repay. As a result, we may be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing to repay such debt amounts, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we are unable to repay our debt when it comes due, then our senior lender or the holders of our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, or both, would have the right to foreclose on our assets. For further disclosure relating to the risks associated with the valuation of our assets, see the risk factors below \u201cIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers . . . .\u201d and \u201cInaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates we use for small face policies . . . .\u201d\nActual results from our life insurance portfolio may not match our projected results, which could adversely affect our ability to service our existing portfolio and meet our debt obligations.\nOur business partially relies on achieving actual results that are materially in line with the results we expect to attain from our investments in life insurance policy assets. In this regard, we believe that the larger the portfolio of life insurance we own, the greater the likelihood that we will achieve our expected results. To our knowledge, rating agencies generally suggest that portfolios of life insurance policies contain enough policies on individual lives to achieve actuarial stability in receiving expected cash flows. For instance, in a life insurance securitization methodology published in 2016, A.M. Best Company concluded that at least 300 lives are necessary to achieve actuarial stability, while Standard & Poor\u2019s has indicated that stability is unlikely to be achieved with less than 1,000 lives. As of December 31, 2019, we owned $2.0 billion in face value of life insurance policies covering 1,073 unique lives.\nHowever, even if our life insurance portfolio is actuarially stable, we still may experience differences between the projection models we use and actual mortalities, which generally has been the case over the past several years. Differences between our expectations and actual mortality results could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. In such a case, we may face liquidity problems, including difficulties servicing our remaining portfolio of policies and servicing our outstanding debt obligations. Continued or material failures to meet our expected results could decrease the attractiveness of our securities in the eyes of potential investors, thereby making it even more difficult to obtain capital needed to service and grow the portfolio - to the extent we allocate capital to life insurance policy purchases, and service our existing debt.\nOur investments in life insurance policies have inherent risks, including fraud and legal challenges to the validity of the policies, which we will be unable to eliminate and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we face certain risks associated with insurance fraud and other legal challenges to the validity of the policy. For example, to the extent the insured is not aware of the existence of the policy, the insured does not exist, or the insurance company does not recognize the policy, the insurance company may cancel or rescind the policy thereby causing the loss of an investment in that policy. In addition, if an insured\u2019s medical records have been altered in such a way as to shorten a life expectancy as reported, this may cause us to overpay for the related policy. Finally, we may experience legal challenges from insurance companies claiming that the insured failed to have an insurable interest at the time the policy was originally purchased or that the policy owner made fraudulent disclosures to the insurer at the time the policy was purchased (e.g., disclosures pertaining to the health status of the insured or the existence or sources of premium financing), or challenges from the beneficiaries of an insurance policy claiming that the sale of the policy to us was invalid.\nTo mitigate these risks, our origination practices and underwriting procedures include a current verification of coverage from the insurance company, a complete due-diligence investigation of the insured and accompanying medical records, a review of the life insurance policy application, and a requirement that the policy has been in force for at least two years. We also conduct a legal review of any premium financing associated with the policy to determine if an insurable interest existed at the time of its issuance. Nevertheless, these steps will not eliminate the risk of fraud or legal challenges to the life insurance policies we purchase. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may prove our due-diligence and risk-mitigation efforts inadequate. If a significant face amount of policies were invalidated for reasons of fraud or any other reason, our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur ownership of life insurance policies issued by insurers that are unable to pay claims presented to them could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation, our financial condition, or even our overall prospects.\nWe currently rely on the payment of policy claims by insurers as our most significant source of revenue collection. In essence, the life insurance assets we own represent the obligations of insurers to pay the benefit amount under the relevant policy upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, in our business, we face the \u201ccredit risk\u201d that a particular insurer will be financially unable to pay claims when and as they become due. Depending on how many policies we own that are issued by insurers having financial difficulties at the time a claim is presented for payment, this risk could be significant enough to have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation, our financial condition, or even our overall prospects.\nTo mitigate this credit risk, we generally purchase policies issued only by insurers with an investment-grade credit rating from one or more of Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s, or A.M. Best Company. As of December 31, 2019, 95.7% of the face value benefits of our life insurance policies were issued by insurers having an investment-grade rating (BBB or better) by Standard & Poor\u2019s. We also review our exposure to credit risk associated with our portfolio of life insurance policies when estimating its fair value. In evaluating the policies\u2019 credit risk, we consider items such as insurance company solvency, credit risk indicators, and general economic conditions. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate credit risk exposure and to reflect this risk in our portfolio valuation, we cannot predict with any certainty whether a particular insurer will be in a financial position to satisfy amounts that it owes under life insurance policies it has issued when a claim for payment is presented.\nWe have relied materially on information provided or obtained by third parties in the acquisition of life insurance policies. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information could materially and adversely affect the value of the policies we own, our results of operation and the value of our securities.\nOur acquisition of each life insurance policy is negotiated based on variables and particular facts that are unique to the policy itself and the health of the insured. The facts we obtain about the policies and the insured at the time when the policy was applied for and obtained are based on the insured\u2019s factual representations to the insurance company, and the facts the insurance company separately obtains in the course of its own due-diligence examination, such as facts concerning the health of the insured and whether or not there is an insurable interest present when the policy was issued. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information relating to a policy or insured could materially and adversely impact the value of the policies we own and could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our securities.\nAlthough we do not anticipate purchasing additional life insurance policies, our life insurance business continues to be subject to state regulation and changes in those laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation, could negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we are subject to state insurance regulations. Over the past number of years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of states that have adopted legislation and regulations from model laws promulgated by either the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) or by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL). These laws are essentially consumer protection statutes responding to abuses that arose early in the development of our industry, some of which may persist. Today, almost every state has adopted some version of either the NAIC or NCOIL model laws, which generally require the licensing of purchasers of and brokers for life insurance policies, the filing and approval of purchase agreements, and the disclosure of transaction fees. These laws also require various periodic reporting requirements and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive. State statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer, and enforce the laws relating to the purchase of life insurance policies. Under statutory authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways, or issue new administrative rules, any of which could be generally adverse to the industry and potentially the value of our life insurance policy assets.\nIf federal regulators or courts conclude that the purchase of life insurance in the secondary market constitutes, in all cases, a transaction in securities, we could be in violation of existing covenants under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, which could result in significantly diminished access to capital. We could also face increased operational expenses. The materialization of this risk could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, our ability to repay our debt, and possibly threaten the viability of our business.\nOn occasion, the SEC has attempted to regulate the purchase of non-variable universal life insurance policies as transactions in securities under federal securities laws. In July 2010, the SEC issued a Staff Report of its Life Settlement Task Force. In that report, the Staff recommended that certain types of purchased insurance policies be classified as securities. The SEC has not taken any position on the Staff Report, and there is no indication if the SEC will take any action to implement the recommendations of the Staff Report. In addition, there have been several federal court cases in which transactions involving the purchase and fractionalization of life insurance policies have been held to be transactions in securities under the federal Securities Act of 1933.\nWe believe that the matters discussed in the Staff Report and existing case law do not impact our current business model because our purchases of life insurance policies are distinguishable from those cases that have been held by courts, and advocated by the Staff Report, to be transactions in securities. For example, neither we nor any of our affiliates are involved in the fractionalization of life insurance policies, and we presently do not purchase significant amounts of variable life insurance policies. As a practical matter, if all or a majority of our life insurance policies were deemed to be \u201csecurities\u201d under federal securities laws, either through an expansion of the definition of what constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d the expansion of the types of transactions in life insurance policies that would constitute transactions in \u201csecurities,\u201d or the elimination or limitation of available exemptions and exceptions (whether by statutory change, regulatory change, or administrative or court interpretation), then we or one or more of our affiliated entities could become subject to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940. This outcome would likely have a material and negative effect on our Company by imposing additional regulations and rules to our governance structure, operations, and our capital structure. In particular, this outcome would likely cause us to be in violation of existing covenants under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation requiring us not to operate or be characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This breach would likely adversely affect our liquidity and increase our cost of capital and operational expenses, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. Such an outcome could also threaten our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due and the viability of our business.\nIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers and rely on to calculate our expected returns on our investments in life insurance policies change, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected, as well as the value of our collateral and our ability to service our debt obligations.\nWhen we acquire a life insurance policy, the expected internal rate of return we calculate is based upon the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over an actuarial life expectancy estimate. We presently obtain these estimates from third-party medical-actuarial underwriting companies. In addition to actuarial life expectancies, we rely on a pricing and premium forecasting software model developed by a third-party actuarial firm for the valuation of policies we purchase, future mortality revenues, and the calculation of anticipated internal rates of return. These pricing models forecast the estimated future premiums due as well the future mortalities of insureds.\nAll actuarial life expectancies (and related forecasting software) are subject to interpretation and change based on evolving medical technology, actuarial data, and analytical techniques. Additionally, we are required under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation to update life expectancy estimates for pledged life insurance policies with face amounts greater than $750,000 by December 18, 2020, and obtain updated life expectancy updates no less frequently than once every five years. Previously, we were required to update life expectancy estimates for pledged life insurance policies with face amounts greater than $750,000 every two years beginning from the closing date of the first amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation (or approximately the end of 2019). Our prior experience in updating life expectancies has generally resulted in longer life expectancies for most, but not all, of the insureds within our portfolio. Adverse impacts on the value of our life insurance policy portfolio or our cash flow could in turn impair the value of the collateral we have pledged to our creditors and our ability to service our debt and obligations as they come due.\nInaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates we use for small face policies could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 697 \u201csmall face\u201d life insurance policies (i.e., those policies with $1 million in face value of benefits or less) having $395.8 million in aggregate face value of benefits.\nThe underwriting processes we use to evaluate, price and purchase small face policies are different from, and may not be as reliable as, the processes we use for life insurance policies with larger face values of benefits. In particular, the processes we use to develop or obtain life expectancy estimates and the related mortality curves for small face policies are less extensive than traditional methods. These processes include obtaining either a single fully underwritten or simplified report as opposed to two fully underwritten reports. A simplified third-party underwriting report is based on a self-reported medical interview and may be supplemented with additional information obtained from a pharmacy benefit manager database that is provided to one or more medical-actuarial underwriting firms to obtain a simplified life expectancy report. Although we obtain professional actuarial guidance regarding these processes, our simplified underwriting methodology may not be as reliable as the processes we use for policies with larger (i.e., greater than $1 million) face value of benefits.\nAny shortcomings in the process we use to evaluate, price, purchase and value our small face policies, or significant inaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates relating to those policies, could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any such outcomes could have a negative and possibly material effect on our ability to satisfy our debts.\nWe rely on estimated rates of mortality when valuing life insurance policies and forecasting the performance of our life insurance portfolio, and we also rely on other estimates derived from statistical methodologies for projecting our future cash flows. If any of our estimates prove to be incorrect, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations.\nIf we project we will receive cash inflows from policies sooner than we actually do, we may not be able to make payment on our debt obligations in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, a significant medical discovery or advance that results in mortality improvements among seniors could have a material adverse effect on the value of our life insurance investments.\nWe use a modeling practice for projecting cash flows known as the \u201cprobabilistic method.\u201d This is an actuarial method that uses the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over time (a mortality curve) to project the flow of policy benefits to us and to project premiums that must be paid by us. This method requires the input of life expectancy assumptions. These inputs are then used to estimate the discounted cash flows from the life insurance portfolio using the ClariNet LS probabilistic and stochastic portfolio pricing model from ClearLife Limited, which estimates the expected cash flows using various mortality probabilities and scenarios.\nPrior to December 2018, the life expectancy inputs were based on the arithmetic average of two separate life expectancy reports (\u201cAverage Life Expectancy method\u201d). Under that methodology, we experienced fewer cash flows from policy benefits than projected. The lower-than-projected policy benefits received corresponded with higher-than-projected premium payments. Using the Average Life Expectancy method, policy benefits actually received were approximately 58% of expected results as of December 31, 2018. This resulted in a delay in policy benefit inflows from those anticipated and premium outflows being higher than anticipated due to the slower than anticipated maturities occurring within the life insurance portfolio.\nAs a result of the challenges we experienced using the Average Life Expectancy method, we revised our methodology using information that was derived from back-testing (the process of applying an analytical method to historical data to see how accurately the method would have predicted actual results) the mortality cash flow performance of our life insurance portfolio using the longest life expectancy report received from the Life Expectancy Providers used for pricing at the time the life insurance policies were acquired (the \u201cLongest Life Expectancy\u201d). This contrasts with our historical methodology of projecting mortality cash flows, used prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, which, as described above, typically used the average of two such life expectancy reports. Given the methodology change, we anticipate the receipt of policy benefits and the payment of premiums to more closely track cash flow estimates in the future; however, this cannot be guaranteed.\nOur enhanced Longest Life Expectancy valuation methodology uses the Longest Life Expectancy report result at the time of purchase combined with a multiplier factor applied for variance in our portfolio of actual to expected experience using the Longest Life Expectancy results. Our revised methodology uses a static portfolio multiplier we must recalculate anytime the six-month moving average of the difference between actual portfolio performance and projected performance of cumulative face value maturities deviates by more than one standard deviation from the mean and such deviation persists for three consecutive months and continues as of the current quarter-end month. As of December 31, 2019, the six-month moving average of the difference between actual portfolio performance and projected performance of cumulative face value of maturities was within one standard deviation from the mean. As such, our valuation methodology did not require an update to our portfolio mortality multiplier (PMM) during the current quarter.\nWe use the current future cash flow projection to generate our expected internal rate of return on the life insurance policy portfolio we own. Any change to these projections, pricing models, methodology, premium forecasting assumptions, cash flow projections, or mortality assumptions accompanied therewith that increase the projected cost-of-insurance premiums or decrease the probability of mortality could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and financial condition. Ultimately, this could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service and repayment obligations and our viability.\nCost-of-insurance (premium) increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased cost-of-insurance (\u201cCOI\u201d) charges (i.e., premium charges) for the universal life insurance policies we own in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 33% of the policies in our life insurance portfolio have premium levels that are guaranteed under the terms of the policy to keep the policy\u2019s death benefit in force even in a situation where the policy\u2019s cash account has been wholly depleted. On the remaining approximately 67% of our policies, we pay \u201cnon-guaranteed COI charges\u201d and are subject to the risk that the insurer could increase the COI charges for the policy. In all cases, the amount of increase is subject to any limits that may be set forth in the insurance policy. Because very few of the policies we own have significant cash account value balances, any COI increase will require us to use more cash to satisfy the minimum premium amount required to keep the related policy in force, and this could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nA COI increase can also be expected to impair the value of the affected policy because extra expense (i.e., additional premium amounts) will be required to keep the policy in force, and such extra expense will diminish the economic value, or return, of the policy realized upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, any widespread COI increases in policies we own would likely have a material and adverse effect on the value of our portfolio, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nOur business and prospects may be adversely affected by changes, lack of growth, or increased competition in the life insurance secondary market.\nThe growth of the secondary life insurance policy market may be negatively affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including: negative publicity about the life insurance secondary market based on actual or perceived abuses; and the adoption of additional governmental regulation.\nThe relatively new and evolving nature of the market in which we operate makes the related risks difficult to identify and quantify. Nevertheless, contractions in the secondary market for life insurance policies, whether resulting from general economic conditions, regulatory or legal pressures, or otherwise (including regulatory pressures exerted on us or others involved in the secondary market for life insurance), could make participation in the market generally less desirable. This could in turn depress the prices at which life insurance policies on the secondary market are bought and sold and have a negative impact on the estimated value of the policies we own. If the value of the policies we own decreases, our results of operation and financial condition could suffer.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nWe have a relatively limited history of operations, a history of net losses, and our future earnings, if any, and cash flows may be volatile, resulting in uncertainty about our ability to service and repay our debt when it comes due, redeem preferred stock when requested and uncertainty about our prospects generally.\nWe are a company with a relatively limited operating history, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast our earnings and cash flows. We had net income attributable to common shareholders of $91.1 million in the year ended 2019. Net income attributable to common shareholders in 2019 includes a gain on the consolidation of Beneficient of $249.7 million. We incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $136.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Our lack of a significant history and the evolving nature of the market in which we operate make it likely that there are risks inherent to our business that are yet to be recognized by us or others, or not fully appreciated, and that could result in us suffering further losses. As a result of the foregoing, an investment in our securities necessarily involves uncertainty about the stability of our operating results, cash flows and, ultimately, our ability to service and repay our debt and our prospects generally. In addition, any volatility in our operating results we experience may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and may otherwise adversely impact our business operations. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $1.6 billion of debt including our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, and Beneficient\u2019s other borrowings, which are due in June 2020. Our indebtedness could have significant effects on our business and the holders of our debt. For example, it could:\n\u25cf require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the available cash flow to fund acquisitions of alternative investments, working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf require payments of principal and interest that may be greater than our cash flow from operations;\n\u25cf force us to dispose of life insurance policies or other investments, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf restrict us from exploiting other business opportunities;\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $184.6 million of borrowings outstanding under our second amended and restated credit facility with LNV Corporation, which bore interest at variable rates. If interest rates increase significantly, our ability to borrow additional funds may be reduced and the risk related to our indebtedness would intensify.\nIn addition, most of our current debt is, and we anticipate that much of our future debt will be, non-amortizing and payable in balloon payments. Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of that debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance debt maturing in future years or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the then-existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital or sales of facilities, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. Additionally, we may incur significant penalties if we choose to prepay the debt.\nWe critically rely on debt financing for our business. Any inability to borrow could adversely affect our business operations, our ability to satisfy our debt-payment obligations and, ultimately, our prospects and viability.\nTo date, we have chosen to finance our business principally through the issuance of debt, including debt incurred by our subsidiary GWG DLP Funding IV, LLC (\u201cDLP IV\u201d) under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements), our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds. Our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation is secured by all of the assets of DLP IV, has a maximum amount of $300.0 million, and the outstanding balance at December 31, 2019 was $184.6 million.\nObligations under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation have a maturity date of September 27, 2029. Our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds have scheduled maturities as set forth below in the risk factor \u201cIf a significant number of holders . . . .\u201d Our debt facilities and offerings are the most important sources of financing on which our business continues to critically rely to grow and maintain our exposure to alternative assets - which include our portfolio of life insurance policies and our investments in Beneficient - as well as service existing debt.\nOur business model is based on the acquisition of alternative assets financed primarily through debt financing. These alternative assets are typically long-term and may not produce cash flow for an extended period of time. For example, we do not receive cash in respect of acquired life insurance policies until the insured individual dies. The resulting asset/liability mismatch can result in a liquidity shortage if we are unable to renew maturing short-term debt or secure suitable additional financing. In such a situation, we could be forced to sell assets at less than optimal (distressed) prices. We thus rely on continued access to financing to enable us to grow our exposure to alternative assets and to pay the attendant premiums and costs of maintaining the life insurance portfolio, all while satisfying our current interest and principal repayment obligations under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds and our dividend obligations on our preferred stock. Proceeds from life insurance policies that have been pledged under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation will first be applied to the repayment of our obligations under the credit facility according to a waterfall amortization formula that is largely controlled by LNV Corporation. Therefore, we may not receive all of the proceeds from matured life insurance policies. Accordingly, until we achieve sufficient cash flows derived from our portfolio of life insurance policies, we expect to rely on advances from our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation and proceeds from our L Bond offering to satisfy our ongoing financing and liquidity needs. Likewise, until interest and dividends from our investments in Beneficient reach a significant size to service our various debt obligations, we expect to rely on advances from our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation and proceeds from our L Bond offering for these amounts.\nContinued access to financing and liquidity under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation (other than premium payments on existing policies pledged thereto), the offering of our L Bonds, or otherwise is not guaranteed. Due to our failure to deliver GWG Life audited financial statements for 2018 to LNV Corporation within 90 days after the end of the year and the failure to deliver GWG Life unaudited financial statements within 45 days after March 31, 2019, we were in violation of our debt covenants under our amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. CLMG Corp., as administrative agent for LNV Corporation, issued a forbearance extending the delivery of these reports to July 22, 2019. Although the covenant violations were cured during the forbearance period, until we regained compliance with our debt covenants, we were prohibited from receiving advances under the amended and restated senior credit facility, and we were not entitled to any excess amounts received from policies pledged under the amended and restated senior credit facility. See \u201cAn inability to obtain accurate and timely financial information from Beneficient may prevent us from complying with reporting obligations under federal securities law \u2026.\u201d In addition, general economic conditions could limit our access to financing, as could regulatory or legal pressures exerted on us, our financiers, or those involved in the procurement of financing such as brokers, dealers, and registered investment advisors. If we are unable to borrow under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation or otherwise for any reason, or to renew or replace the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation when it comes due, or if we are forced to discontinue our L Bond offering for any significant length of time and for any reason, our business would be adversely impacted and our ability to service and repay our debt obligations would be compromised, thereby negatively affecting our business prospects, the value of our common stock and perhaps our viability.\nAs of March 24, 2020, we had remaining capacity of approximately $120 million under our current registered L Bond offering. We are in the process of preparing and filing a registration statement to offer additional L Bonds. If, for any reason, there is a delay in the filing or the effective date of this additional offering, our financial condition and ability to continue operations may be negatively affected.\nWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking from our securities offerings and may be unable to meet our overall business objective of growing and diversifying our alternative asset exposure.\nThe offer and sale of our L Bonds is a principal means by which we intend to raise funds needed to meet our business and financial goals. However, if we are unable to continue to do so for any reason, we may be unable to meet our goals. If actual cash flows from our portfolio of life insurance policies do not occur as we have forecasted, which has thus far been the case, we could be forced to sell our investments in life insurance policies in order to service or satisfy our debt-related obligations. Likewise, if our investments in Beneficient do not perform as we have projected, we could be forced to sell such investments in order to service or satisfy such debt-related obligations. Presently, none of our material investments (life insurance policies and investments in Beneficient) are supported by liquid secondary markets and our investments in Beneficient contain transfer restrictions. If we are forced to sell any material amount of these investments, we may be unable to sell them at prices we believe are optimal or at or above the carrying value of such investments, particularly if our sale of assets occurs at a time when we are (or are perceived to be) in distress. In any such event, our business and the value of our securities would likely be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe depend upon cash distributions from our subsidiaries, and contractual restrictions on distributions to us or adverse events at one of our operating subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay our debts, redeem preferred stock when requested and continue operating our business.\nGWG Holdings, Inc. is a holding company. As a holding company, we conduct our operations through operating subsidiaries, and as such our most significant assets are cash and our ownership interests in our subsidiaries, controlled affiliates and equity investees. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations, including our debt-related and dividend-payment obligations, materially depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us. In this regard, the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us is, and will continue to be, restricted by certain negative covenants in the agreement governing our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. If any of these limitations were to materially impede the flow of cash to us, our ability to service and repay our debt, including obligations under the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, and make cash dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any adverse corporate event at the subsidiary level, such as a declaration of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or an event of default under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us, and thereby materially and adversely affect our ability to service and repay our debt and make cash dividend payments, and negatively impact our ability to continue operations.\nThe collateral granted as security for our obligations under the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds may be insufficient to repay the indebtedness upon an event of default.\nGWG Holdings (the issuer of the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds) and GWG Life (the guarantor of obligations under the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, and a wholly owned subsidiary of GWG Holdings) have each granted a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets to serve as collateral security for obligations under the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds. Importantly, DLP IV, a wholly owned subsidiary of GWG Life, owns a substantial number of our life insurance policies, 77.3% of the face value of our life insurance portfolio as of December 31, 2019, and is the borrower under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. As the borrower under that second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, all of its assets - including all of its life insurance policy assets - serve as collateral for our obligations under the facility.\nBecause of the fact that a substantial number of our life insurance assets are held in our DLP IV subsidiary, and all of those life insurance assets serve as collateral security for our obligations under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, holders of L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds risk the possibility that the collateral security to secure our obligations under the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds may be insufficient to repay holders upon an event of default. Furthermore, while the indenture governing the L Bonds and the Seller Trust L Bonds limits the amount of debt relative to a measure of asset coverage we and our subsidiaries can incur, the indenture permits us and our subsidiaries to incur additional secured debt (subject to the debt coverage ratio) that may be senior to the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds.\nFurthermore, the assets that secure our obligations under the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds are illiquid assets. As a result, the book value of those assets as reflected in our financial statements are based on numerous assumptions and may not necessarily reflect the current market price for those assets, especially in the event of a bulk or distressed sale. Furthermore, a substantial majority of the net assets of Beneficient are currently represented by goodwill as of December 31, 2019. Some or a substantial portion of the proceeds from L Bond sales may be used to make investments in Beneficient. Because these advances may be used by Beneficient for working capital purposes and to repay indebtedness, such investments may not increase the tangible assets securing the L Bonds. If the trustee for the L Bonds were forced to sell all or a portion of the collateral securing them, there can be no assurance that the trustee would be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them, and the trustee might be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.\nIf a significant number of holders of our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds demand repayment of those instruments upon maturity instead of renewing them, and at such time we do not have sufficient capital on hand to fund those repayments (and do not otherwise have access to sufficient capital), we may be forced to liquidate some of our life insurance policies, investments in Beneficient or other assets, which could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $948.1 million in principal amount of L Bonds outstanding (excluding Seller Trust L Bonds). Since we first issued our L Bonds, we have experienced $646.3 million in maturities, of which $341.3 million has renewed for an additional term, as of December 31, 2019. This has provided us with a cumulative historical renewal rate of approximately 52.8% for investments in our L Bonds. Future contractual maturities of L Bonds (excluding Seller Trust L Bonds) as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $366.9 million in principal amount of Seller Trust L Bonds outstanding. The Seller Trust L Bonds have a contractual maturity in August 2023; however, the holders have the ability to exercise a put to require redemption beginning in 2021. Under the Supplemental Indenture for the Seller Trust L Bonds due 2023, in the event of a redemption request, including maturity, by the holders of the Seller Trust L Bonds, GWG in its sole discretion has the ability to satisfy the principal in the form of cash, a pro rata portion of (i) the outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest under the Commercial Loan Agreement and (ii) Ben LP common units, or a combination of cash and such property.\nIf investors holding existing indebtedness that matures do not elect to renew their investments and we do not at such time have or have access to sufficient capital to repay the indebtedness, then we may need to liquidate some of our life insurance policies or other assets earlier than anticipated. In such an event, we may be unable to sell those policies or other assets at prices we believe are fair or otherwise appropriate and such sales could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. See also \u201cWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking . . . .\u201d\nSubordination provisions contained in the indenture will restrict the ability of the trustee or the L Bond or Seller Trust L Bond holders to enforce their rights against us under the indenture, including the right to payment on the L Bonds, if a default then exists under a senior credit facility.\nThe L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds will be subordinate in right of payment to any claims of our senior lender under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. In this regard, subordination provisions limiting the right of L Bond and Seller Trust L Bond holders to enforce their rights are contained in the indenture. These provisions include:\n\u25cf a prohibition on challenging any enforcement action taken by a senior lender, or interfering with any legal action or suits undertaken by a senior lender, against us and our affiliates;\n\u25cf a 180-day standstill period during which there may not be brought any action against us or our affiliates to enforce rights respecting collateral unless our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation has been repaid in full, which period may be extended if the senior lender takes action during such standstill period; and\n\u25cf a prohibition on filing a bankruptcy or insolvency case against us or our affiliates for at least one year plus one day after any senior lender has been paid in full.\nIn the event of a default on a senior credit facility, the indenture prohibits us from making any payment, direct or indirect (whether for interest, principal, as a result of any redemption or repayment at maturity, on default, or otherwise), on the L Bonds, Seller Trust L Bonds and any other indebtedness unless and until: (i) the default respecting the senior credit facility has been cured or waived or has ceased to exist; or (ii) in the case of a non-payment default that permits a senior lender to declare as due and payable all amounts owing under a senior credit facility (but where that senior lender has not yet so declared amounts as being due and payable), the end of the period commencing on the date the trustee receives written notice of default from the senior lender and ending on the earliest of (1) our discharge of the default (or other cure), (2) the trustee\u2019s receipt of a valid waiver of default from the senior lender, or (3) a written notice from the senior lender terminating the payment prohibition.\nDuring any payment prohibition period, neither the holders of the L Bonds, the Seller Trust L Bonds, nor the trustee will have the right, directly or indirectly, to sue to enforce the indenture or the L Bonds or Seller Trust L Bonds. Other provisions of the indenture do permit the trustee to take action to enforce the payment rights of L Bond and Seller Trust L Bond holders after 179 days have passed since the trustee\u2019s receipt of notice of default from a senior lender, but in such case any funds paid as a result of any such suit or enforcement action shall be applied toward the senior credit facility until the facility is indefeasibly paid in full before being applied to the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds.\nThese subordination provisions present the risk that, upon any default by us on obligations owed to our senior lender, the holders of the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds will be unable to enforce their rights to payment.\nIf the 180-day standstill period noted above, or any other limitation on the rights of the trustee or L Bond and Seller Trust L Bond holders to assert their rights to payment of principal or interest under the indenture, is ultimately determined to conflict with provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (most notably sections 316(b) and 317(a) of that Act), then the trustee, as well as any holder who shall not have earlier consented to such subordination provisions, will (notwithstanding such provision contained in the indenture) be authorized to institute a lawsuit for the enforcement of any payment of principal or interest after their respective due dates.\nA failure to maintain compliance with the covenants under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation and the indenture governing the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our business operations.\nWe are subject to various covenants under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, including requirements to timely deliver financial statements to LNV Corporation (our senior lender). Due to our failure to deliver GWG Life audited financial statements for 2018 to LNV Corporation within 90 days after the end of 2018 and the failure to deliver GWG Life unaudited financial statements within 45 days after March 31, 2019, we were in violation of our debt covenants during 2019. Although we regained compliance with our debt covenants in July 2019, if we fail to remain in compliance with our debt covenants, we may not be permitted to request, nor will we be entitled to receive, advances under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, and we will not be entitled to any excess amounts received from policies pledged under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. A failure to deliver required financial statements to LNV Corporation in the future may result in termination of the credit facility absent an extension of such period. We may be unable to repay outstanding amounts under this credit facility unless we are able to replace it with another facility or otherwise obtain capital from other sources, in which case LNV Corporation could elect to foreclose on the life insurance assets held in our DLP IV subsidiary that serve as collateral security.\nUnder the indenture governing the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, as amended, we are subject to various financial and non-financial covenants, including a maximum debt coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our covenants; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of our financial and non-financial covenants in the future. A failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be in default of the indenture governing the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds and the indenture trustee, acting on behalf of the holders of our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, would be within its rights to accelerate the maturity dates of any amounts owed on our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds. If we were unable to repay outstanding amounts, either using current cash reserves or another source of capital, the indenture trustee would have the right, subject to the subordination provisions in the indenture, to foreclose on our assets and the assets of GWG Life (including GWG Life\u2019s equity in DLP IV), which serve as collateral for our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds. If we are required to seek other sources of financing in order to satisfy our obligations under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, our L Bonds or Seller Trust L Bonds, such other sources of capital may be unavailable to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, failure to comply with the covenants under our debt arrangements would have a material and adverse impact on our ability to continue our business operations.\nThe debt coverage ratio, designed to provide some assurance to the holders of the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds that the value of our total assets exceeds our total interest-bearing obligations, values our life insurance policy assets, which represent 62% of our total assets (excluding goodwill) as of December 31, 2019, in a manner that may not be representative of the amount we would actually receive upon a sale of those assets.\nUnder the indenture governing the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, as amended, the maximum amount of L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds we may issue at any time is limited to an amount such that our debt coverage ratio does not exceed 90%. This limitation is designed to provide some basis to ensure that the net present value of policy benefits from our life insurance assets, plus the carrying value of our other assets (including our investments in Beneficient), will be sufficient to meet our obligations to our L Bond and Seller Trust L Bond holders. Expressed as a percentage, the debt coverage ratio was previously defined as the ratio of (i) the total amounts outstanding on interest-bearing debt over (ii) the net present asset value of all life insurance assets we own, plus any cash and cash equivalents held in our accounts, policy benefit receivables and, without duplication, the value of all other assets of the Company, primarily our investments in Beneficient, as reflected on our most recently available balance sheet prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For this purpose, the net present asset value of our life insurance assets is calculated as the present value of the life insurance portfolio\u2019s expected future cash flows discounted at the weighted-average interest rate of the interest-bearing indebtedness for the previous month.\nHowever, effective December 31, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the indenture to define the debt coverage ratio as the ratio, expressed as percentage, of (A) the aggregate sum of all indebtedness (other than Excluded Indebtedness as described below) of GWG Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (including the securities issued under the indenture, but excluding any indebtedness of Ben LP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries) as reflected on GWG Holdings\u2019 most recent consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP over (B) the sum of (i) net present asset value of life insurance policies owned by GWG Holdings and its direct or indirect subsidiaries or affiliates, but excluding life insurance policies held by Ben LP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, plus (ii) all cash (and cash equivalents) held by GWG Holdings and its direct or indirect Subsidiaries or subsidiaries or affiliates, but excluding the cash (and cash equivalents) held by Ben LP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, plus (iii) the original cost basis in GWG Holdings\u2019 investment in common units or other securities of Ben LP, plus (iv) the outstanding principal amount of any outstanding loans made under a commercial loan agreement with GWG Life, as lender, plus (v) the cost basis of assets contributed to GWG Holdings or any direct or indirect subsidiary of GWG Holdings in connection with a Repurchase Transaction, plus (vi) without duplication, the value of all other assets of GWG Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries or affiliates (but excluding the value of assets of Ben LP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries) as reflected on its most recent consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP. For this purpose, \u201cExcluded Indebtedness\u201d is indebtedness that is payable at GWG Holdings\u2019 option in capital stock of GWG Holdings or securities mandatorily convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock of the Company, or any indebtedness that is reasonably expected to be converted or exchanged, directly or indirectly, into such capital stock, provided that under the terms of such indebtedness in the event any such conversion or exchange does not occur in accordance with the terms of such transaction, such indebtedness would be cancelled and any assets received in exchange for such indebtedness would be returned.\nAlthough the debt coverage ratio is designed to provide some basis to ensure that our assets will be sufficient to meet our obligations to the holders of L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, the \u201cnet present value\u201d of our life insurance assets used in the debt coverage ratio is not the same as the GAAP \u201cfair value\u201d of those assets on our balance sheet. Accordingly, the debt coverage ratio is not informative of the amount we and holders of L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds would actually receive if we were forced to sell or liquidate our life insurance related assets. Furthermore, any sale or liquidation of all or a significant portion of our life insurance policies or investments in Beneficient would include significant transactional costs. As a result, our mere compliance with the debt coverage ratio in the indenture will not guarantee that the value of our life insurance assets plus the value of our investments in Beneficient, if sold or liquidated, would in all cases exceed the amount of our obligations to the holders of L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds.\nWe may not realize a return on our investment in InsurTech Holdings, LLC.\nUnder the Operating Agreement of InsurTech Holdings, LLC, we are obligated to invest $20.0 million in InsurTech Holdings over a two year period ending in November 2021, of which $2.1 million was funded in the fourth quarter of 2019. After this two-year period, we will be entitled to receive 100% of operating and capital distributions up to the amount of our cash contributions, and, thereafter 80% of cash flows from operations and capital proceeds. The success of InsurTech Holdings is dependent, in part, on new and unproven technology as part of its life insurance policy underwriting process. If the mortality predictions InsurTech Holdings obtains through use of this technology proves inaccurate, InsurTech Holdings may not generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy the terms of the distributions as provided in the Operating Agreement. Furthermore, any failure by InsurTech Holdings to protect its intellectual property rights could impair its ability to protect its proprietary technology and the value of our investment. As such, we may not realize the return contemplated in the Operating Agreement, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of the services of our key employees, or the failure to attract additional key individuals, would materially adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur success and viability are dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business, especially our sales, policy acquisition and financial management teams. If we were to lose the members of these service teams, we would need to replace them with qualified individuals in a timely manner or our business operations and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nWe have the discretion to purchase assets through different subsidiaries, and to transfer assets among our subsidiaries. Any decision to purchase or hold title to assets in one subsidiary, as opposed to a different subsidiary, may affect the value of collateral security for our debts.\nWe may at our discretion direct the purchase of life insurance policies, investments in Beneficient and other assets by, and the sale of life insurance policies and other assets amongst, different subsidiaries of GWG Holdings. Purchases of assets in, or movements of assets amongst, different subsidiaries could affect the value of the collateral security for obligations under the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds. For example, purchases through, or transfers of life insurance policies to, DLP IV would cause the policies acquired or transferred to become collateral for our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, whereas purchases through, or transfers of life insurance policies to, GWG Life would cause the policies acquired by GWG Life to become collateral for the L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds. Similarly, the pledge of life insurance policies owned by GWG Life Trust, or the transfer of such policies to a subsidiary of GWG Life Trust, with a subsequent pledge of such policies could cause those policies to become collateral for a new loan facility. Accordingly, purchases of assets through, or transfers of assets to, different subsidiaries may affect the value of collateral security for different classes of holders of our debt.\nBeing a public company is expensive and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nWe have been a public reporting company since January 31, 2012. As such, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal, and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly than they would otherwise be, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. These rules and regulations applicable to public companies, and the risks involved in serving as an officer or director of a public company, may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors.\nChanges in general economic conditions could adversely impact our business.\nChanges in general economic conditions, including, for example, interest rates, short term funding markets, investor sentiment, changes specifically affecting competition, technological developments, political and diplomatic events, tax laws, and other factors not known to us today, can substantially and adversely affect our business and prospects. For example, an increase in interest rates would increase our cost of capital and may limit our ability to raise capital and have a corresponding adverse impact on our operating results. While we may engage in certain hedging activities in the future to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates, none of these risks are or will be within our control.\nBusiness disruptions and interruptions and adverse economic conditions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations can be subject to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control, such as the effects of earthquakes, fires, floods, severe weather, public health issues such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus or other pandemic diseases, power failures, telecommunication loss, major accidents, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and other natural and man-made events, some of which may be intensified by the effects of a government response to the event or climate change and changing weather patterns. For example, our corporate headquarters and critical business offices are located in north Texas, which is geographically located in \u201ctornado alley\u201d, an area known for high instances of tornadoes, and which recently experienced catastrophic tornadic activity and blackouts. A tornado or other disaster could cause severe destruction, disruption or interruption to our operations or property and significantly impact our employees.\nMore recently, the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak has impacted several countries around the world, including the United States. There have been numerous reports of the virus outbreak disrupting or restricting supply chains, facility closures, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, and federal, state and local governments requiring business to temporarily close or severely curtail commercial activity. It is also possible that the spread of the coronavirus may have direct effects on our operations, such as high levels of employee sickness and absences, limiting employee travel or increasing telecommuting arrangements. In addition, recent developments and reports indicate the coronavirus has coincided with heightened volatility in financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide. If the coronavirus adversely affects our business operations or leads to a significant or prolonged impact on global markets or economic growth, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. We and other financial institutions generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption or interruption and were not able to resume normal operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the disruption or interruption, we might become vulnerable to fraud, additional expense or other losses, or to a loss of business and clients.\nAlthough we have implemented a business continuity management program that we continue to enhance on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that the program will adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions. Additionally, natural disasters and external events, including those occurring in and around Texas, could affect the business and operations of our clients, which could impair their ability to satisfy obligations to us, impair the value of underlying collateral or otherwise adversely affect their business dealings with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe interest rates under our credit agreement and other agreements may be impacted by the phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. LIBOR is used as a reference rate to calculate interest under certain of our borrowings and receivables. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the preferred alternative reference rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR and recommended a paced transition plan that involves the creation of a reference rate based on SOFR by the end of 2021. SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR. Certain of our borrowing and receivable agreements contain fallback provisions providing for alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, prior to any LIBOR rate transition. As a result, our level of interest payments we incur or receive may change and the new rates we incur may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out.\nWe are dependent on our information systems for our financial reporting, policy-related databases, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our information systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, Internet web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and attacks from viruses or hackers, including cybersecurity threats and incidents. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to targeted measures directed at us, our databases, policies, and/or the subjects of acquired policies. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks, attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful. System failures or interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could breach the security of the personal information of the subjects of the acquired policies and could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Strategic Relationship with The Beneficient Company Group, L.P., including the Purchase and Contribution Transaction:\nOn December 28, 2018, we held the Final Closing of the Exchange Transaction with Beneficient and the Seller Trusts. On April 15, 2019, Jon R. Sabes, the Company\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer and a former director, and Steven F. Sabes, the Company\u2019s former Executive Vice President and a former director, entered into the Purchase and Contribution with, among others, Ben LP. The closing of the Purchase and Contribution occurred on April 26, 2019. On December 31, 2019, we transferred approximately $79 million to Ben LP in return for 666,667 common units of Ben LP and a Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account of BCH and obtained the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of Beneficient Management pursuant to the Investment Agreement and the Exchange Agreement. Also on December 31, 2019, in a transaction related to the Investment Agreement, GWG Holdings transferred its interest in the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account to its wholly owned subsidiary, GWG Life. These transactions are collectively referred to as the \u201cBeneficient Transactions.\u201d You should consider carefully the following risk factors related to the Beneficient Transactions in evaluating us and our business.\nOur loans to Beneficient are contractually and structurally subordinated to the debt and other liabilities of the Beneficient entities that are not obligors on such loans, which means that creditors of such entities will be paid from their assets before we would have any claims to those assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, GWG Life had loaned to Ben LP approximately $197.4 million, including accrued interest, pursuant to the Commercial Loan Agreement. The amounts owed to GWG Life under the Commercial Loan Agreement are contractually subordinated to Beneficient\u2019s obligations (\u201cSenior Obligations\u201d) (i) to commercial banks pursuant to commercial term loan and/or revolving credit facilities, and (ii) to Beneficient\u2019s NPC-B limited partnership interest, if issued. As of December 31, 2019, Beneficient had outstanding approximately $153.1 million of Senior Obligations. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of Ben LP\u2019s assets are held by subsidiaries, the amounts owed to us under the Commercial Loan Agreement are structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of those entities, which means that creditors of those entities will be paid from their assets before GWG Life would have any claims to those assets.\nOn May 31, 2019, GWG Life agreed to loan $65.0 million to six common law trusts established as part of alternative asset financings extended by a subsidiary of Beneficient. An initial advance in the principal amount of $50.0 million was funded on June 3, 2019 and the second advance of $15.0 million was made on November 22, 2019. These loans are contractually subordinated to the secured obligations of Beneficient and its affiliates outstanding to HCLP Nominees, L.L.C. and Beneficient Holdings, Inc.\nBeneficient may be unable to operate its business successfully, which would negatively impact its ability to generate distributable cash flow and increase the value of Ben LP\u2019s common units.\nBeneficient plans to provide mid-to-high net worth individuals (i.e., individuals having a net worth of between $5 million and $30 million) with trust services and related liquidity products (collectively, \u201ctrust services and liquidity products\u201d) for illiquid investment funds and other alternative assets those individuals may own, and a variety of other financial services, including custody and clearing of alternative assets, fund and trust administration, retirement funds and insurance services for covering risks attendant to owning or managing alternative assets. The success of the Beneficient Transactions from our perspective will depend largely on Beneficient\u2019s ability to operate its business successfully, generate distributable cash flow, and increase the value of Ben LP\u2019s common units (of which we are a significant owner) and our Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account of BCH. If Beneficient is unable to do so, such inability will negatively impact our operations and may result in an impairment of goodwill. Furthermore, to date, Ben LP\u2019s originations of liquidity products have been transacted with a limited number of family offices, fund-of-funds and institutions. These types of clients, specifically fund-of-funds and institutions, may not represent the target market of Ben\u2019s liquidity products in the future.\nWe may be unable to capitalize on the anticipated benefits of the Beneficient Transactions.\nWe entered into the Beneficient Transactions anticipating that such transactions would provide significant financial and strategic benefits, including, significantly increasing our common equity, significantly reducing our leverage ratio (as measured by total assets divided by total equity), the introduction of new opportunities to lower our cost of funds (an important driver of stockholder value), diversifying our revenue and cash flow sources resulting in more consistent earnings, and increasing our public float and the liquidity in our common stock, thereby increasing our common stockholder base and potentially attracting additional equity analyst coverage (both of which are important factors in maximizing share valuation). In addition, we believe that the Beneficient Transactions have created opportunities for us and Beneficient to pursue strategies that are mutually advantageous, including the opportunity to leverage our knowledge, experience and significant infrastructure in, and the marketing, sales and servicing of, the independent broker dealer market and the related market for illiquid alternative investments - a prime target market for the origination of Beneficient\u2019s suite of liquidity products. We believe that the expansion of our strategic relationship with Beneficient has created a unified platform uniquely positioned to provide an expanded suite of products, services and resources for investors and the financial professionals who assist them. We intend to collaborate extensively with Beneficient and capitalize on our respective capabilities, relationships and services. Specifically, the Purchase and Contribution Agreement contemplates that we will seek to enter into an agreement with Beneficient pursuant to which we would offer and distribute (through a FINRA registered managing broker-dealer) Beneficient\u2019s liquidity products and services. There is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits from the Beneficient Transactions. Failure to realize these benefits will likely negatively impact the results of our operations, our business prospects, the ultimate success of our strategic relationship and the value of our common stock.\nWe have and will continue to invest in Beneficient, and Beneficient\u2019s financial performance and results of operations will have a direct impact on our financial performance.\nAs a result of the Investment Agreement and the Exchange Agreement (as described above), GWG was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the Board of Directors of the general partner of Beneficient. As a result, effective as of December 31, 2019, GWG controls Beneficient and consolidates Beneficient for financial statement reporting purposes. As such, our basis of accounting for and the presentation of our investment in Beneficient is materially different from that described in previous audited and unaudited financial statements. Because Beneficient will represent a significant percentage of our consolidated assets, the impact on our financial statements of Beneficient\u2019s financial performance may be material.\nBeneficient has experienced significant delays in obtaining trust company charters and may be ultimately unable to do so, which outcome would hinder Beneficient\u2019s ability to successfully pursue its current business plan and could adversely affect the value of Ben LP\u2019s common units.\nBeneficient has applied for trust charters from the Texas Department of Banking and intends to carry on much of its business through two trust company subsidiaries. While it anticipates receiving the trust charters in the near future, there have been significant delays and there can be no assurance that Beneficient will ultimately be successful in obtaining trust company charters. Because Beneficient\u2019s current business plans are based on obtaining regulatory approval to operate as regulated trust companies, a failure to do so may materially and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects, which would likely negatively impact our results of operations and may result in impairment of goodwill.\nBen LP\u2019s partnership agreement eliminates fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed to us under Delaware law.\nBen LP\u2019s business and affairs are managed by Beneficient Management. Ben LP\u2019s partnership agreement eliminates the fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by Beneficient Management under Delaware law and replaces them with the duties expressly set forth in such agreement. Ben LP\u2019s partnership agreement provides that, when the general partner is permitted or required to make a decision in its \u201cdiscretion\u201d or pursuant to a provision not subject to an express standard of \u201cgood faith,\u201d in making such decision, the general partner has no duty to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting Beneficient or any other person. If a decision under Ben LP\u2019s partnership agreement is subject to an express standard of \u201cgood faith,\u201d such decision will not constitute a breach of the agreement if the decision is approved by (i) a majority of the members of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Beneficient, (ii) holders of a majority of the voting power of the Ben LP\u2019s common units entitled to vote (excluding voting common units owned by the general partner and its affiliates), or (iii) the general partner acting without a subjective belief that such decision was adverse to the interests of Ben LP. Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Beneficient, on the other hand, and the general partner may be able to favor its own interest to the detriment of Beneficient and the holders of the common units of Ben LP.\nBeneficient has significant debt obligations outstanding to us and has the ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nSubject to certain restrictions within our current Commercial Loan Agreement with Beneficient, Beneficient is permitted to incur additional indebtedness ranking senior to the Commercial Loan. If Beneficient is unable to execute its business plans, it may materially and adversely impact Beneficient\u2019s ability to repay its indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Commercial Loan Agreement in accordance with its terms. As a significant holder of Beneficient indebtedness, a payment default under any additional indebtedness Beneficient may incur, or under the Commercial Loan Agreement, would likely have a corresponding negative impact on the value of our assets (including the value of our Ben LP common units) and the price of our common stock.\nOur percentage ownership in Ben LP may be diluted significantly.\nOn December 31, 2019, GWG was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the board of directors of the general partner of Ben LP (as contemplated by the Investment and Exchange Agreements). As such, GWG controls Beneficient and consolidates Beneficient for financial statement reporting purposes. It is possible that GWG and Beneficient will redeem all outstanding common units of Ben LP not owned by GWG such that GWG becomes the sole owner of such common units. In this scenario, \u201cdilution\u201d refers to the potentially significant economic rights and privileges of the limited partner interests (described below) that are senior or preferred to our common interests that could result in substantial economic dilution to GWG.\nUpon completion of the Beneficient Transactions, we owned approximately 95.5% of the issued and outstanding common units in Ben LP. This percentage ownership does not take into account (i) limited partner interests that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding securities issued by Beneficient or its affiliates, or (ii) additional limited partner interests that may be issued after the closing of the Beneficient Transactions. Taking these issuances into account, our ownership interest in common units of Ben LP could be reduced significantly below 50%. In addition, and importantly, Beneficient Management has discretion to cause Ben LP to issue additional limited partner interests from time to time, and Ben LP\u2019s partnership agreement contains no meaningful restrictions on this authority. Moreover, the Beneficient organizational structure permits the future issuance of additional securities that can, upon certain circumstances or at the discretion of their holders, be converted into additional limited partner interests in Ben LP. Should any of these actions be taken, our percentage ownership in Ben LP will be diluted.\nThe resale of our common stock issued in the Exchange Transaction could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock and result in a destabilized trading market for our common stock.\nUpon the Final Closing, we issued 27,013,516 shares of our common stock, which in the aggregate represented approximately 82% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. The shares issued in the Exchange Transaction are subject to resale restrictions applicable to \u201crestricted securities\u201d under applicable federal securities laws. The Master Exchange Agreement and related ancillary agreements require that we register the resale of the shares of common stock issued in the Final Closing to the Seller Trusts to the extent permitted by applicable SEC rules and regulations. Upon the effectiveness of any such registration, or the lapse of applicable resale restrictions under applicable securities laws, the shares of our common stock issued in the Exchange Transaction will be available for resale in the public equity markets. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of these shares or the availability of these shares for future sale could have on the market price of our common stock.\nThe Seller Trusts, collectively, own a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock, enabling them to exert significant influence over our operations, which may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAccording to their most recent Schedule 13D/A filing, the Seller Trusts own approximately 78.4% of our outstanding common stock. The Seller Trusts are a group of individual common law trusts that received shares of our common stock in the Exchange Transaction. The trustee of each of the Seller Trusts is Delaware Trust Company. The trust advisors of each trust are two individuals unrelated to each other, Murray T. Holland (our President and Chief Executive Officer) and James E. Turvey, who have sole decision-making authority with respect to each Seller Trust. The beneficiary of each of the Seller Trusts is MHT Financial, LLC. The current members of MHT Financial, LLC include Murray T. Holland (our President and Chief Executive Officer) and an entity owned by Shawn T. Terry and Mike McGill. The Seller Trusts are entitled to full voting rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock they own. Because the Seller Trusts, collectively, own a substantial majority of our outstanding voting securities, the Seller Trusts are entitled to cast a majority of the votes on all matters requiring stockholder votes, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This effectively transferred voting control over the Company to the Seller Trusts from Messrs. Jon and Steven Sabes, who held a majority of our outstanding common stock not held by the Seller Trusts prior to the closing of the Purchase and Contribution Transaction. This concentrated ownership enables the Seller Trusts to exert significant influence over all of our corporate activities, including the election of directors to our Board of Directors, and may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of the Seller Trusts may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company. Also, the Seller Trusts may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in their judgments, could enhance their investments in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our shares could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our shares upon a change in control. In addition, this continued concentration of share ownership, albeit in new hands, may adversely affect the trading price of our shares because prospective investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with such significant stockholders.\nWe are currently relying on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, pursuant to which \u201ccontrolled companies\u201d are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements otherwise applicable under Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules.\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules exempt \u201ccontrolled companies,\u201d or companies of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company, from certain corporate governance requirements, including those requirements that:\n\u25cf A majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u25cf Compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the Board of Directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u25cf Director nominees be selected or recommended to the Board of Directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe Seller Trusts that acquired our shares in the Beneficient Transactions own approximately 78.4% of our common stock and are considered a group for purposes of the Nasdaq controlled company listing rule, based on the most recent Schedule 13D/A filed by the Seller Trusts and the trust advisors with the SEC. As a result, we are currently a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and are relying on the controlled company exemption for certain of the above requirements, including those related to the determination or recommendation of officer compensation. Accordingly, should the interests of the Seller Trusts differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders do not have the same protections generally as stockholders of other Nasdaq-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on the controlled company exemption from the specified corporate governance requirements. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nAn inability to obtain accurate and timely financial information from Beneficient may prevent us from complying with reporting obligations under federal securities law and compromise our ability to finance our operations through the public equity or debt markets.\nOn December 31, 2019, Beneficient became a consolidated subsidiary of GWG Holdings. Until we can fully integrate our accounting and financial reporting systems with Beneficient, we will continue to be heavily reliant on Beneficient to provide us with accurate and timely financial reporting that will allow us to timely prepare and file our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and in compliance with SEC regulations and Nasdaq listing rules. Although we plan to integrate our accounting and financial reporting systems with Beneficient, this integration is not expected to be complete until the second half of 2020.\nBeneficient\u2019s management and auditors identified several material weaknesses in Beneficient\u2019s internal controls as of December 31, 2018 relating to various Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission components including control environment, risk assessment, monitoring activities and control activities. More specifically, material weaknesses were identified relating to, among other matters, insufficient accounting resources to properly capture and accurately record all material transactions; insufficient controls surrounding certain key valuation models and surrounding data inputs into such key valuation models; and ineffective controls over the period end financial reporting process. Beneficient has implemented remedial measures and will perform testing over the operating effectiveness of these controls in mid-2020. While there can be no assurance that the operating effectiveness efforts will be completed without further remedial efforts, Beneficient believes that the remedial efforts put in place address the material weaknesses noted in the 2018 internal control findings. Until the integration of our accounting and financial reporting systems with Beneficient is complete, if Beneficient is unable to maintain its effective internal control over financial reporting, the financial information we receive from Beneficient necessary to produce our consolidated financial statements may not be prepared in sufficient time to allow for us to produce our consolidated financial statements within required time periods.\nIf we are unable to obtain accurate and timely financial information from Beneficient and are unable to timely prepare and file our financial statements as a result, we may fail to comply with reporting obligations under federal securities law, become subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Market, and may be unable to utilize the public debt or equity markets to finance our operations. Because we have been heavily reliant on the public offer and sale of L Bonds, discontinuing our L Bond offers would have a material adverse impact on our ability to expand our alternative asset portfolio, service our existing portfolio of life insurance policies, satisfy payment requirements under our debt obligations, including our L Bonds and Seller Trust L Bonds, and otherwise fund our operations. In addition, our failure to deliver financial information and comply with disclosure requirements under applicable SEC regulations may result in covenant violations under our second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation and hurt our reputation and credibility with our stockholders and our debt holders.\nWe were unable, without unreasonable effort and expense, to complete our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 within the time period required for us to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was due on or prior to April 1, 2019. Likewise, we were unable to timely file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019.\nOur inability to timely file these Reports was due, in part, to a delay in our obtaining financial information from Beneficient. In each of these instances, and in accordance with standard procedures related to the delayed filing of periodic reports with the SEC, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that we were not in compliance with our filing requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). We ultimately regained compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s filing requirements within the grace periods provided by Nasdaq under its Marketplace Rules and delisting procedures. However, if we fail to maintain compliance in the future, we may be delisted, in which case our business and the value of our securities would likely be materially and adversely impacted. Our inability to timely file these reports also resulted in a temporary suspension of the offering of our L Bonds.\nA failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial results.\nBoth GWG Holdings and Beneficient reported material weaknesses as part of their respective 2018 annual audits. GWG Holdings\u2019 material weaknesses included ineffective information and communication controls with external parties due to delays in the financial statement close and reporting process as evidenced by the untimely filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. Also, management of GWG Holdings did not have sufficient accounting resources and personnel to effectively design and execute process level controls around certain complex or non-recurring transactions to ensure proper application of U.S. GAAP. Beneficient\u2019s material weaknesses included, among other matters, insufficient accounting resources to properly capture and accurately record all material transactions; insufficient controls surrounding certain key valuation models and surrounding data inputs into such key valuation models; and ineffective controls over the period end financial reporting process.\nGWG is a smaller reporting company for SEC reporting purposes and has historically had limited accounting and financial reporting resources. Prior to the December 31, 2019 consolidation with GWG, Beneficient was not subject to the reporting obligations required under the Sarbanes-Oxley (\u201cSOX\u201d) Act of 2002. The consolidation of Beneficient and GWG will result in increased accounting, reporting and internal controls complexity as the companies integrate systems and processes. Furthermore, Beneficient, as a consolidated subsidiary of GWG, is required to be SOX compliant as of December 31, 2020. While both GWG and Beneficient have implemented remedial measures to address their respective 2018 internal control findings, and the companies have plans to fully integrate information systems and processes and to share accounting and financial reporting resources, there is no certainty that GWG and Beneficient will be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for GWG and Beneficient to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully. If either GWG or Beneficient, or both, cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, the Company\u2019s ability to accurately report its financial results could be adversely affected and its reputation and operating results would be harmed. GWG and Beneficient cannot be certain that their efforts to further establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting will be successful. Any failure to further develop, as necessary, or to maintain effective internal controls could harm the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. See the risk factor above \u201cAn inability to obtain accurate and timely financial information from Beneficient may prevent us from complying with reporting obligations under federal securities law . . . .\u201d Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information.\nOur remedies for an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d under our Commercial Loan Agreement with Ben LP are limited.\nAs part of the Exchange Transaction, GWG Life, as lender, and Ben LP, as borrower, entered into the Commercial Loan Agreement under which $197.4 million in principal and interest was outstanding at December 31, 2019. The principal amount under the Commercial Loan Agreement is due on August 9, 2023; provided that (a) in the event Ben LP completes at least one public offering of its common units raising at least $50 million, which on its own or together with any other public offering of Ben LP\u2019s common units results in Ben LP raising at least $100 million, then the maturity date will be extended to August 9, 2028; and (b) in the event that Ben LP (i) completes at least one public offering of its common units raising at least $50 million which on its own or together with any other public offering of Ben LP\u2019s common units results in Ben LP raising at least $100 million and (ii) at least 75% of Beneficient Holding\u2019s total outstanding NPC-B limited partnership interests have been converted to shares of Ben LP\u2019s common units, then the maturity date will be extended to August 9, 2033.\nBen LP\u2019s obligations under the Commercial Loan Agreement are unsecured, and repayment of the balance under the Commercial Loan Agreement is subordinated in right of payment to any of Beneficient\u2019s senior debt and to obligations that may arise in connection with its NPC-B Unit limited partnership interests. As a result, our remedies upon a default by Ben LP under the Commercial Loan Agreement that constitutes an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d (as defined in the Commercial Loan Agreement) are limited to accelerating the loan and commencing a lawsuit for collection. We would not have the right to force Ben LP into bankruptcy or, since the Commercial Loan is unsecured, foreclose on any collateral until a judgment is secured. In addition, under the subordination provisions of the Commercial Loan Agreement, we would have the right to receive proceeds of any sale of Ben LP assets or any liquidation proceeding only after Beneficient\u2019s senior lender is paid in full.\nOur evolving operating priorities, allocation of capital and overall strategic direction may prove to be unsuccessful.\nThe consummation of the Purchase and Contribution Transaction resulted in the reconstitution of our board of directors and management team. Such reconstitution has altered and will likely continue to alter our operating priorities, allocation of capital and overall strategic direction from those in place prior to the consummation of the Purchase and Contribution Transaction. There is no assurance that our operating priorities, allocation of capital and overall strategic direction will ultimately prove to be successful.\nThe Purchase and Contribution Agreement provides that GWG and Beneficient will use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a joint venture agreement, which may significantly alter the existing strategic relationship between GWG and Beneficient.\nThe Purchase and Contribution Agreement provides that GWG and Beneficient will use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a joint venture agreement. The terms of that agreement have not been determined and they may significantly alter the existing strategic relationship between GWG and Beneficient, including providing for further integration of our respective businesses and establishing additional or alternative financing arrangements. The terms of the joint venture agreement are subject to approval of the Board of Directors of GWG and the Board of Directors of Beneficient Management and subject to the exercise of their respective fiduciary duties. The Board of Directors of GWG has established a special committee of independent and disinterested directors to review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed transactions with or involving Beneficient.\nRisks Related to Beneficient\u2019s operations:\nIn addition to the risks set forth above related to our controlling financial interest in Beneficient generally, the risk factors set forth below relate specifically to Beneficient\u2019s business operations. Because Ben LP is now our consolidated subsidiary as of December 31, 2019, the impact on our financial results of Beneficient\u2019s current business operations will be material to the overall results of our business operations. Therefore, you should also consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business.\nBeneficient does not have any operating history for its new business.\nBeneficient\u2019s management has a long track record of successfully organizing and operating businesses, including Beneficient\u2019s founder who organized Beneficient\u2019s predecessor in 2003, but Beneficient\u2019s business plan represents a new phase in its development and Beneficient does not have significant operating history under its current business plan. Additionally, Beneficient\u2019s proposed trust company subsidiaries have little operating history. In general, companies that seek to implement these kinds of business plans present substantial business and financial risks and uncertainties.\nBeneficient\u2019s success depends on certain key executives and the ability to attract, retain, and develop new professionals.\nBeneficient\u2019s success depends in large part upon the skills, experience, personal reputations and network of business contacts of certain key executives. These individuals\u2019 reputations, business relationships and expertise are critical elements in the successful implementation of Beneficient\u2019s business strategy. Accordingly, the loss of any of the key executives could materially harm Beneficient\u2019s business and the value of Beneficient.\nBeneficient\u2019s key executives are directly responsible for setting Beneficient\u2019s strategic direction, operating Beneficient\u2019s business, maintaining and expanding business and other critical relationships, clients and business partners and identifying expansion opportunities. Should Beneficient lose one of these key executives, it may have to search externally for a qualified replacement, which search may be prolonged, and Beneficient cannot provide assurance that it will be able to hire such a replacement on a timely basis or at all.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense. Thus, the loss of any of these key personnel, by resignation, termination, death or disability, or Beneficient\u2019s inability to recruit and retain qualified replacements, could cause disruption in Beneficient\u2019s business and could prevent Beneficient from fully implementing Beneficient\u2019s business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business, growth and profitability.\nBeneficient may not be able to grow, effectively manage its growth, or achieve profitability.\nA principal focus of Beneficient\u2019s strategy is to expand the number of Beneficient\u2019s product offerings and grow Beneficient\u2019s trust administration products and services. Beneficient\u2019s future growth depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond Beneficient\u2019s ability to control. These factors include Beneficient\u2019s ability to:\n\u25cf accurately assess the demand for and sell the products and offerings that Beneficient expects to develop to meet demand;\n\u25cf compete against other client solutions and other vendors;\n\u25cf maintain the quality of Beneficient\u2019s trust administration products and services;\n\u25cf effectively manage Beneficient\u2019s financing underwriting criteria and manage Ben Collateral, including with effective risk management discipline;\n\u25cf update Beneficient\u2019s products and offerings and develop new products and offerings needed by clients; and\n\u25cf hire, train and retain qualified personnel to manage and operate Beneficient\u2019s business as it is expected to grow.\nA deficiency in any of these factors could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s ability to achieve or manage growth or profitability.\nBeneficient\u2019s current business plan may be significantly compromised if it is unable to obtain its trust company charters.\nBeneficient\u2019s proposed trust company subsidiaries may not commence trust company operations until those subsidiaries receive the necessary trust charters from the Texas Department of Banking. Beneficient filed limited trust association charter applications for its proposed trust company subsidiaries with the Texas Department of Banking in September of 2018 and submitted revised charter applications on March 6, 2020. Approval of those applications is not assured. Even if the charter applications are approved, Beneficient expects that the approvals will be subject to certain conditions including, among others, that the proposed trust company subsidiaries satisfy certain minimum restricted capital requirements. There is no assurance that Beneficient will be able to satisfy all the conditions imposed by the Texas Department of Banking in connection with its approvals. In addition, such conditions could delay the anticipated time for commencement of trust operations.\nIf Beneficient is ultimately unable to obtain satisfactory limited trust association charters, Beneficient\u2019s ability to implement its current business plan may be significantly compromised. Without the trust company charters, federal regulations would significantly limit the amount of alternative asset liquidity financings (\u201cLiquidity Transactions\u201d) Beneficient could undertake.\nBeneficient\u2019s business faces substantial competition from a variety of financial solution companies and other liquidity providers.\nBeneficient faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of competitors, many of which are larger, have an established track record and reputation, and may have more financial resources. Beneficient\u2019s business competes with other providers of financial and trust administration such as bank holding companies, commercial and savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, asset managers and their private equity affiliates, insurance companies and a growing list of other local, regional and national institutions which offer financial and trust administration services. Beneficient\u2019s business also competes with other providers of liquidity for alternative assets, which may hinder Beneficient\u2019s ability to offer Liquidity Transactions to the market. If Beneficient is unable to compete effectively, Beneficient will lose market share and income generated from trust administration services and other financial products will decline.\nBeneficient\u2019s liquidity, profitability and business may be adversely affected by an inability to access, or ability to access only on unfavorable terms, the capital markets.\nLiquidity is essential to Beneficient\u2019s business and Beneficient must continue to grow its capital to maintain liquidity. Future cash flows from Beneficient\u2019s financing arrangements and proceeds from borrowings may not be sufficient for Beneficient to satisfy Beneficient\u2019s working capital and liquidity needs. To the extent that working capital is insufficient to fund future operating costs, Beneficient may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings, including investments in the form of equity investments and debt advances from GWG, reduce expenses, or curtail its growth. Many factors will affect Beneficient\u2019s capital needs and their amount and timing, including Beneficient\u2019s growth and profitability, as well as market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments.\nBeneficient\u2019s liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access, or ability to access only on unfavorable terms, secured and/or unsecured debt markets or equity markets, including access to capital markets indirectly through GWG, an inability to access funds from its subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem its interests in the Ben Collateral, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This situation may arise due to circumstances that Beneficient may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or Beneficient, a disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and other geographic areas.\nIn addition, Beneficient\u2019s ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors or lenders develop a negative perception of Beneficient\u2019s long-term or short-term financial prospects. An increase in debt of Beneficient and/or its subsidiaries may increase Beneficient\u2019s leverage and reduce its interest coverage. To the extent that Beneficient or its subsidiaries raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our equity holders may be diluted.\nIf Beneficient is unable to raise funding using the methods described above, Beneficient would likely need to consider financing or liquidating assets to meet maturing liabilities. Beneficient may be unable to sell some of its assets or Beneficient may have to sell assets at a discount to market value, either of which could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf Beneficient is unable to repay or refinance its existing credit facilities, then Beneficient will be required to either liquidate assets to repay these loans or to raise additional capital through the sale of equity.\nBeneficient is subject to repayment risk in connection with its Liquidity Transactions.\nBeneficient\u2019s Liquidity Transactions are structured as loans from Beneficient\u2019s subsidiary to unaffiliated trusts that acquire ownership interests in the alternative assets comprising the collateral supporting Beneficient\u2019s Liquidity Transactions (the \u201cBen Collateral\u201d). Loans extended by Beneficient do not require repayment prior to maturity and are subject to a risk of default. Unaffiliated trusts may default on a loan from Beneficient even if the cash flow from alternative assets in the Ben Collateral supporting such a loan is sufficient to otherwise repay interest and principal on the loan.\nA determination that Beneficient is an unregistered investment company would have serious adverse consequences.\nA determination that Beneficient or any of the proposed trust company subsidiaries is an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) would have serious adverse consequences. Beneficient does not believe it could operate its business effectively as a registered investment company. As a result, Beneficient would have to change its operations so as not to be an investment company. Changes could include refraining from raising capital, changing the types of products and services that Beneficient provides, and changing the nature of the Ben Collateral. Furthermore, if at any time it were established that Beneficient or any of the proposed trust company subsidiaries had been operating as an investment company in violation of the registration requirements of the 1940 Act, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that such company: (i) could become subject to SEC enforcement and investigation, monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, (ii) would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with such company undertaken during the period in which it was established that such company was an unregistered investment company, and (iii) would face adverse action from the Texas Department of Banking, either in relation to its pending application for trust company charters, or if such charters are granted, in connection with such charters. Such developments would be likely to have material and adverse consequences for Beneficient. In addition, if Beneficient were treated as an investment company, it would not be eligible to be taxed as a partnership and instead would be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in a material and adverse impact on the returns of holders of Ben LP common units. Upon completion of the Beneficient Transactions, GWG Holdings owned approximately 95.5% of Ben LP common units.\nBeneficient\u2019s results of operations may fluctuate from period to period.\nBeneficient expects that the results of its operations may vary significantly from period to period for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of Beneficient\u2019s control and difficult to predict, including demand for Beneficient\u2019s liquidity products and trust administration services, performance of the loans against alternative assets comprising the Ben Collateral and concentration of risk in the loan portfolios. Because Beneficient\u2019s results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Many but not all of the factors that may cause Beneficient\u2019s results of operations to fluctuate are presented in these risk factors.\nBeneficient may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nBeneficient seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure by developing an effective risk and control framework, which encompasses a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance, and legal reporting systems; internal controls; management review processes; and other mechanisms. While Beneficient employs and will continue to develop and deploy a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every risk event in all market environments or the specific nature of the impact and timing of such outcomes.\nBeneficient\u2019s operations, products and services may be negatively impacted by changes in economic and market conditions.\nBeneficient\u2019s operations, products and services may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions because the performance of Beneficient\u2019s liquidity products and trust administration services is directly affected by conditions in the financial and securities markets. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile (meaning that performance results can vary greatly from period to period) and are directly affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions, geopolitics and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond Beneficient\u2019s control. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in Beneficient\u2019s performance and may adversely affect the assets comprising the Ben Collateral and the loans against the assets comprising the Ben Collateral.\nFluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may negatively impact the business of Beneficient.\nFluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may negatively impact the business of Beneficient. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond Beneficient\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Beneficient\u2019s assets and liabilities can be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates. As a result, Beneficient may adopt asset and liability management policies to minimize the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of Liquidity Transactions, interests in the Ben Collateral, funding sources, and derivatives. However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates can impact Beneficient\u2019s financial condition. Beneficient\u2019s ability to successfully manage its interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks is subject to factors beyond its control.\nBeneficient relies on other companies to provide key components of Beneficient\u2019s business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide and are expected to continue to provide key components of Beneficient\u2019s business infrastructure. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing Beneficient their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to Beneficient\u2019s clients, impair Beneficient\u2019s ability to conduct its business efficiently and effectively, and/or result in regulatory action, financial loss, litigation, and loss of reputation. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nBeneficient may only be able to offer a limited number of products and solutions.\nBeneficient may only be able to offer a limited number of products and solutions due to regulatory, capital or other restrictions. Accordingly, the prospects for Beneficient\u2019s success may be solely dependent upon the performance of a single product or solution, or dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products or solutions. A lack of diversification in its offerings may make Beneficient susceptible to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory conditions, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon Beneficient\u2019s ability to operate its business and/or grow its business in the future. Further, Beneficient would not be able to diversify its operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses that offering a comprehensive suite of solutions could provide.\nBeneficient depends on the accuracy and completeness of information from and about clients.\nIn deciding whether to enter into Liquidity Transactions with clients, Beneficient may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients, including financial statements and other financial information. Beneficient also may rely on representations of clients as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in connection with Liquidity Transactions, Beneficient may rely on information provided by a client such as net asset value of an underlying alternative asset. Beneficient also relies, and will continue to rely, on client representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of the assets underlying the Liquidity Transaction. Reliance on clients may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including bribery, fraud or other illegal activities) or risks that are necessary or helpful in evaluating such transaction opportunity. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect and may be more widespread in certain jurisdictions. Beneficient\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if Beneficient relies on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nBeneficient will be subject to comprehensive governmental regulation and supervision.\nBeneficient and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment and will be subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental agencies. Beneficient and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in federal and state laws, regulations, governmental policies, tax laws and accounting principles. As Beneficient\u2019s business grows, Beneficient and its subsidiaries expect to become subject to additional regulatory agencies\u2019 regulation. Changes in regulations or the regulatory environment could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business.\nBeneficient may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations.\nBeneficient may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations and be held accountable for such violations, even if such violations are inadvertent. Some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. For example, Beneficient is subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or \u201cOFAC,\u201d that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities.\nBeneficient faces a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement actions under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). Beneficient is also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If Beneficient\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, Beneficient will be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on Beneficient\u2019s ability to make distributions to its unitholders and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of Beneficient\u2019s business plan. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for Beneficient. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficult market conditions can cause investors to reduce or suspend their investments in alternative assets or their desire to liquidate alternative assets they hold, which could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business.\nDuring economic downturns, alternative asset owners may suffer from decreasing returns (including negative returns and loss of principal investment), liquidity pressure, increased volatility and difficulty maintaining targeted asset allocations, and investors may decrease or suspend making new fund investments during and after such periods. As the economy begins to recover from these periods, investors may elect to reduce their exposure to alternative investments, resulting in a smaller overall pool of potential clients in the industry and clients for Beneficient\u2019s services and products in the future. In the event all or part of this analysis proves true, when trying to find new clients Beneficient will be competing for fewer available alternative assets to administer in an increasingly competitive environment, which could lead to terms less favorable to Beneficient as well as difficulty in reaching new clients. Such changes would adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nBeneficient is dependent on the continued success of the alternative asset industry.\nBeneficient\u2019s success depends, in part, on the continued success of alternative asset managers and the alternative asset industry that has enjoyed a prolonged period of expansion and profitability. Such expansion and profitability is subject to market conditions and other factors outside of Beneficient\u2019s control (and the control of managers of alternative assets). There is no assurance that such expansion and profitability will continue. Beyond business and financial success, the alternative asset industry may also become subject to greater governmental regulation and investigation, which could have a negative effect on Beneficient.\nA failure of Beneficient to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business.\nBeneficient has developed robust procedures and controls designed to identify and address conflicts of interest relevant to its business operations. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and Beneficient\u2019s reputation could be damaged, and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with Beneficient may be affected, if Beneficient fails, or appears to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nA failure in Beneficient\u2019s operational systems as well as human error or malfeasance, could impair Beneficient\u2019s liquidity, disrupt Beneficient\u2019s business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage Beneficient\u2019s reputation, and cause losses.\nBeneficient faces a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in its business, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The following are some of the more important factors that could affect Beneficient\u2019s business.\nBeneficient\u2019s financial, accounting, data processing or other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond Beneficient\u2019s control. Beneficient must continuously update systems to support its operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to ensure that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, Beneficient\u2019s clients or Beneficient. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by Beneficient\u2019s employees and the operation of Beneficient\u2019s systems and business and those of Beneficient\u2019s clients and its third-party service providers and vendors. Additionally, computing devices may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or have other inherent weaknesses.\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, Beneficient\u2019s business ultimately relies on people as its greatest resource, and, from time-to-time, they may make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that are not always identified immediately by Beneficient\u2019s technological processes or by Beneficient\u2019s controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. These errors or violations can include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or simple errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors and malfeasance, even if promptly discovered and remediated, can result in material losses and liabilities for Beneficient.\nAny cybersecurity-attack or other security breach of Beneficient\u2019s technology systems, or those of third-party vendors Beneficient relies on, could subject Beneficient to significant liability and harm Beneficient\u2019s business operations and reputation.\nCybersecurity attacks and security breaches of Beneficient\u2019s technology systems, including those of Beneficient\u2019s clients and third-party vendors, may subject Beneficient to liability and harm Beneficient\u2019s business operations and overall reputation. Beneficient\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents continue to grow, and there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information in recent years. Beneficient is regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity risks could disrupt Beneficient\u2019s operations, negatively impact Beneficient\u2019s ability to compete and result in injury to Beneficient\u2019s reputation, downtime, loss of revenue, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Although Beneficient has developed, and continues to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, and while Beneficient expects to periodically test this security, Beneficient\u2019s security measures, information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information; damage to Beneficient\u2019s reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or Beneficient\u2019s exposure to civil or criminal litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Ben\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties upon whom Beneficient relies face similar threats, which could directly or indirectly impact Beneficient\u2019s business and operations. The occurrence of a cybersecurity-incident or attack on Beneficient\u2019s third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on Beneficient\u2019s reputation and on Beneficient\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTransfer restrictions applicable to alternative assets may prevent Beneficient from being able to attract a sufficient number of clients to achieve Beneficient\u2019s business goals.\nMany alternative assets contain stringent transfer restrictions imposed by the issuing entity, which may prevent Beneficient from entering into Liquidity Transactions or providing trust administration services with respect to such assets. Such restrictions may result in Beneficient not being able to attract a sufficient number of clients or Liquidity Transactions and, as a result, its revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nBeneficient\u2019s failure to correctly identify mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBeneficient may seek to facilitate its growth through mergers, acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Mergers, acquisitions, and other strategic transactions involve inherent risks that could compromise the success of the combined business and dilute the holdings of Beneficient\u2019s unitholders. If Beneficient is incorrect when assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of such transactions, or if Beneficient fails to adequately integrate the acquired businesses or individuals, the success of the combined business could be compromised. Business acquisitions are subject to the risks commonly associated with such transactions including, among others, potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and to acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, potential disruptions to the business of the combined company and potential diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, the impairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and clients as a result of changes in management, potential litigation or other legal risks, potential write-downs related to goodwill impairments in connection with acquisitions and dilution to the unitholders of the combined company if the acquisition is made for equity of the combined company. In addition, investment strategies, technologies or businesses of acquired companies may not be effectively assimilated into Beneficient\u2019s business or may have a negative effect on the combined company\u2019s revenues or earnings. The combined company may also incur significant expenses to complete acquisitions and support acquired investment strategies and businesses. Further, any such acquisitions may be funded with cash, debt or equity, which could dilute the holdings or limit the rights of Beneficient\u2019s unitholders. Finally, Beneficient may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms.\nDivestitures involve inherent risks that could compromise the success of Beneficient\u2019s business. Risks related to divestitures can include difficulties in the separation of the divested business, loss of clients, retention or obligation to indemnify certain liabilities, the failure of counterparties to satisfy payment obligations, unfavorable market conditions that may impact any earnout or contingency payment due to Beneficient and unexpected difficulties in losing employees of the divested business.\nThere is no assurance that Beneficient will be successful in overcoming these or other risks encountered with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions. These risks may prevent Beneficient from realizing the expected benefits from mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction.\nBeneficient faces risks associated with the ability of its information technology systems and its people and processes to support its operations and future growth effectively.\nIn order to serve Beneficient\u2019s market effectively, Beneficient has developed, and is continually developing, a comprehensive array of products and services. In order to support these products and services and for Beneficient to operate effectively, Beneficient has developed, purchased and licensed information technology and other systems and processes. As Beneficient\u2019s business grows, Beneficient expects to continue to invest in and enhance these systems, and its people and processes.\nThese investments and enhancements may affect Beneficient\u2019s future profitability and overall effectiveness. From time to time, Beneficient may change, consolidate, replace, add or upgrade existing systems or processes, which if not implemented properly to allow for an effective transition, may have an adverse effect on Beneficient\u2019s operations, including business interruptions, which may result in inefficiencies, revenue losses, client losses, exposure to fraudulent activities, regulatory enforcement actions, or damage to Beneficient\u2019s reputation. Beneficient also outsources certain operational and other functions to consultants or other third parties. If Beneficient does not implement its systems effectively or if its outsourcing business partners do not perform their functions properly, there could be an adverse effect on Beneficient. There can be no assurance that Beneficient will be able to effectively maintain or improve its systems and processes, or utilize outsourced talent, to meet its business needs efficiently. Any failure of such could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s operations, financial condition, results of operations, future growth and reputation.\nBeneficient faces risks from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against it.\nFrom time to time, Beneficient may be named as a defendant or otherwise become involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Future actions against Beneficient may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to Beneficient, which could materially adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to Beneficient.\nBeneficient\u2019s businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject Beneficient to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Beneficient to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing Beneficient\u2019s profitability.\nWhile Beneficient seeks to insure against potential risks, Beneficient may not be able to obtain insurance to cover certain risks, or obtain coverage on favorable terms, and the insurance that Beneficient has may be inadequate to cover certain civil or criminal proceedings or regulatory investigations and associated costs.\nBeneficient may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation, including claims or litigation relating to its fiduciary responsibilities.\nBeneficient\u2019s business involves the risk that clients or others may sue Beneficient, claiming that Beneficient has failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them. This risk would be heightened when Beneficient\u2019s trust company subsidiaries begin serving as fiduciaries for their clients following the issuance of state trust company charters. Specifically, Beneficient\u2019s trust company subsidiaries would be required to (i) adhere to the fiduciary standard of care required under the terms of the governing documents or applicable law, and (ii) properly discharge their fiduciary duties. If Beneficient fails to comply with these fiduciary obligations, it could incur significant costs and possibly liability, which could materially and adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Liability for breach of fiduciary duty may be difficult to assess or quantify and its existence and magnitude may remain unknown for a substantial period of time. Additionally, an alleged breach of fiduciary duty, regardless of the merits of such alleged breach, could significantly damage Beneficient\u2019s reputation and cause it to incur legal and other costs. Claims made or actions brought against Beneficient, whether founded or unfounded, may result in injunctions, settlements, damages, fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on Beneficient\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, could adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s ability to raise additional funding or attract new clients, and could require changes to Beneficient\u2019s business. Even if Beneficient defends itself successfully, the cost of litigation is often substantial, and public reports regarding claims made against Beneficient may cause damage to its reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and equityholders, consequently affecting Beneficient\u2019s earnings negatively.\nA change in Beneficient\u2019s tax treatment could adversely affect Beneficient.\nBeneficient is subject to a variety of tax laws and tax regulations by national, regional and local governments. Beneficient, and most of its subsidiaries, are pass through entities that are generally not subject to taxation. Rather, Beneficient passes on the distributive share of income to its investors who bear the burden of any tax liability that may be generated by such income. These tax laws and regulations (including the applicable tax rates), and their interpretation and application, may change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or Beneficient\u2019s financial position.\nIn addition, without the consent of Beneficient\u2019s unitholders, Beneficient\u2019s general partner may elect to convert Beneficient into a corporation or be taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if certain conditions have been met. Such a conversion could be a taxable event to Beneficient\u2019s unitholders where gain or loss is recognized. In addition, a conversion would subject all of Beneficient\u2019s future net income to a level of corporate tax, which may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution or reinvestment.\nBeneficient\u2019s business, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe Beneficient money, securities or other assets or whose securities or obligations Beneficient holds.\nBeneficient is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe Beneficient money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to Beneficient due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Beneficient.\nIn the event Beneficient uses hedging transactions to manage certain market risks, Beneficient\u2019s business, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by unanticipated market conditions including interest rates, currency exchange rates, equity market behavior, and other relevant asset classes.\nWhen managing its exposure to market risks, Beneficient may make use of forward contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars and floors or pursue other strategies or use other forms of derivative instruments to limit its exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments, including changes in prevailing interest rates and currency exchange rates.\nThe use of hedging transactions and other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of changes in the value of a position does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines. However, such activities can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of the position. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases. Moreover, it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a market development that is so generally anticipated that a hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into at an acceptable price. Although Beneficient may enter into hedging transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, unanticipated market changes may result in poorer overall investment performance than if the transaction had not been executed. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in connection with hedging activities and price movements in a position being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, Beneficient may not be successful in establishing a sufficient correlation or a sufficient matching of cash flows between the instruments used in a hedging or other derivative transaction and the position being hedged. An insufficient correlation could prevent Beneficient from achieving the intended result and create new risks of loss. In addition, Beneficient will not be able to fully limit exposure against all changes in the values of the alternative assets underlying its Liquidity Transactions, because the values of such assets are likely to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which will be beyond Beneficient\u2019s control, and it may not be able to respond to such fluctuations in a timely manner or at all.\nThe interest rates under Beneficient\u2019s loan, credit and other agreements may be impacted by the phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. LIBOR is used as a reference rate to calculate interest under certain of our borrowings and receivables. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the preferred alternative reference rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR and recommended a paced transition plan that involves the creation of a reference rate based on SOFR by the end of 2021. SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR. Certain of Beneficient\u2019s borrowing and receivable agreements contain fallback provisions providing for alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, prior to any LIBOR rate transition. As a result, our level of interest payments we incur or receive may change and the new rates we incur may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out.\nBeneficient\u2019s fair value estimates of illiquid assets may not accurately estimate prices obtained at the time of sale and Beneficient cannot provide assurance that the values of the alternative assets underlying the Liquidity Transactions that it reports from time to time will be realized.\nAsset valuations for which there is no readily available market, such as the illiquid assets comprising the Ben Collateral, require estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Given this uncertainty, the fair values of such assets as reflected in estimated net asset value may not reflect the prices that would actually be obtained if and when such assets would be sold.\nUnder Beneficient\u2019s valuation policy, Beneficient bases its estimates of the fair value of the alternative assets in the Ben Collateral on the fund reported net asset value reported to it by the underlying fund managers. Because alternative asset managers generally hold a high proportion of their investments in assets for which market prices are not readily available, fund reported net asset value will necessarily incorporate estimates of fair value made by the fund managers. As there is no single method for determining fair value, there may be significant variations in the valuation policies used by different fund managers in the Ben Collateral.\nIn addition, due to time lags in receiving valuation information from fund managers, Beneficient typically does not and will not have up-to-date information from all underlying funds at the time it calculates the fair value of the alternative assets underlying the Liquidity Transactions. Beneficient typically is not and will not be aware of all material developments at a fund or its underlying portfolio companies that could adversely affect the value of the funds in the Ben Collateral.\nEven if market quotations are available for the alternative assets underlying the Liquidity Transactions, such quotations may not reflect the value that could actually be realized because of various factors, including the possible illiquidity associated with a large ownership position, subsequent illiquidity in the market for a company\u2019s securities, future market price volatility or the potential for a future loss in market value. Realizations at values significantly lower than the fair values recorded in Beneficient\u2019s financial statements could have a material adverse effect on the net asset value of the alternative asset, and therefore the value of the beneficial interests and the corresponding Liquidity Transactions.\nFurthermore, a substantial majority of the net assets of Beneficient are currently represented by intangible assets and goodwill. Beneficient\u2019s management performs goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing annually, during the fourth quarter, or when events occur, or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate impairment has occurred. Goodwill impairment exists when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. If Beneficient\u2019s management concludes that a portion of its goodwill is impaired, and writes down the value of such goodwill, the value of our investment in Beneficient may also have to be written down.\nBeneficient\u2019s liquidity, profitability and business may be adversely affected by concentrations of assets comprising the Ben Collateral.\nThe Ben Collateral may be concentrated in certain issuers, funds, sectors, geographic regions, countries, or asset types, which could negatively affect performance as well as Beneficient\u2019s financial results, including Beneficient\u2019s capital position, earnings, cash flows, and growth.\nSimilarly, Beneficient\u2019s balance sheet may have significant exposures to certain issuers, industries, or asset classes. As a result, Beneficient\u2019s net cash flows and asset valuations (e.g., net asset value) may exhibit greater volatility due to idiosyncratic factors specific to companies, industries, regions, and asset classes. Moreover, because of such concentrations, Beneficient may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for Beneficient\u2019s competitors.\nIn the case of Beneficient\u2019s exposure to investments in publicly traded companies, its operating results would be impacted by volatility in the public markets generally and in the stock prices of such companies.\nThe due diligence process that Beneficient undertakes in connection with Liquidity Transactions may or may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with such Liquidity Transaction, and even if Beneficient receives complete and accurate information it may not translate to identifying the appropriate underwriting criteria.\nBefore offering liquidity solutions to clients, Beneficient conducts due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each transaction. When conducting due diligence, Beneficient may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, technological, environmental, social, governance and legal and regulatory issues. In addition to Beneficient\u2019s own employees, outside consultants, legal advisors and accountants may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment and the parties involved. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding the alternative assets behind a potential Liquidity Transaction, Beneficient relies on the resources available to it, including information provided by the potential client of the Liquidity Transaction, the general partners and managers of the alternative assets the client holds, and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations, and such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment ultimately being successful. Moreover, even in the event that Beneficient receives complete and accurate information in the due diligence process, it may not translate to identifying the appropriate underwriting criteria, which could result in negative reputational effects, and/or otherwise materially and adversely affect Beneficient\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on Beneficient\u2019s ability to collect and analyze data regarding its clients\u2019 alternative assets investments could adversely affect its business.\nThe Ben Collateral includes interests in alternative assets. Beneficient depends on the continuation of its relationships with the general partners and sponsors of the underlying funds and investments in order to maintain current data on these alternative assets.
