RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Each of these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nTrends in crude oil and natural gas prices may affect the drilling and production activity, profitability and financial stability of our customers and therefore the demand for, and profitability of, our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe oil and gas industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns of varying length and severity. Most recently, the oil and gas industry experienced a significant downturn in 2015 and 2016. Our ability to regulate our operating activities in response to lower oilfield service activity levels during periodic industry downturns is important to our business, results of operations and prospects. Demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies and the corresponding drilling and production activity. The level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in crude oil and natural gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide economic activity;\n\u2022\nthe level of exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\ninterest rates and the cost of capital;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulation;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and foreign policies regarding exploration and development of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability and/or desire of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other major producers to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations regarding future oil and gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring and producing oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe pace of adoption and cost of developing alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe availability, expiration date and price of onshore and offshore leases;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in onshore and offshore areas;\n\u2022\nthe success of drilling for oil and gas in unconventional resource plays such as shale formations;\n\u2022\ntakeaway capacity within producing basins;\n\u2022\nalternative opportunities to invest in onshore exploration and production opportunities;\n\u2022\ndomestic and global political and economic uncertainty, socio-political unrest and instability, terrorism or hostilities;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions.\nCrude oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have been characterized by significant volatility in recent years. In particular, the prices of crude oil and natural gas were highly volatile from 2014 through 2016 and declined dramatically through early 2016. Prices of crude oil began to recover in late 2016, but experienced a volatile decline again during late 2018. We expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities.\nA significant downturn in the industry could result in the reduction in demand for our products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe might be unable to successfully compete with other companies in our industry.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in our markets are customer service, product quality and performance, price, breadth of product offering, market expertise and innovation. In some of our product and service offerings, we compete with the oil and gas industry\u2019s largest oilfield service providers. These large national and multi-national companies may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, and a stronger presence in geographic markets than us. They may also have more robust financial and technical capabilities. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. As a result of the competitive environment in which we operate, we may lose market share, be unable to maintain or increase prices for our products and services, or be unable to acquire\nadditional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to develop new products and technologies, our competitive position may be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our sales and market share.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies and the introduction of new products and services. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products and services on a cost-effective basis, to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner, and to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and technologies, or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies, may significantly reduce future revenues and materially and adversely affect our competitive position. While we intend to continue to commit financial resources and effort to the development of new products and services, we may not be able to successfully differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. Our customers may not consider our proposed products and services to be of value to them or may not view them as superior to our competitors\u2019 products and services. In addition, our competitors or customers may develop new technologies which address similar or improved solutions to our existing technologies. Further, we may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies, develop new products, achieve and maintain technological advantages or protect technological advantages through intellectual property rights. If we do not successfully compete through the development and introduction of new products and technologies, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.\nWe purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which exposes us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect our operating profits. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by endeavoring to make strategic purchasing decisions, broadening our supplier base and passing along increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to a competitor\u2019s pricing pressure or other factors. While raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Certain of our product lines depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers and vendors. The ability of these third parties to deliver raw materials may be affected by events beyond our control. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and gas development and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our customers, which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could limit our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities. Although we do not directly engage in drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities, we provide products and services to operators in the oil and gas industry. There has been significant growth in opposition to oil and gas development both in the United States and globally by national, state and local governments, regulatory agencies, non-government organizations and public citizens. This opposition is focused on attempting to limit or stop hydrocarbon development in certain areas. Examples of such opposition include: efforts to reduce access to public and private lands; delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction; limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal; delaying or denying air-quality permits; advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity.\nIn addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of oil and gas development through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, including on the time, place and manner of drilling activities, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing or other facets of crude oil and natural gas exploration and development in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. Increased regulation and opposition to oil and gas activities could increase the potential for litigation concerning these activities, and include the companies who provide products and services used in hydrocarbon development, such as ours.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, or local levels imposing reporting obligations, or otherwise limiting or delaying hydrocarbon development, could make it more difficult to complete oil and gas wells, increase our customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the oil and gas activities they pursue. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our products and services. In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny, including lawsuits, could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance or the risks of liability limit the ability or willingness of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous and complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment. These laws and regulations may adversely affect our customers by limiting or curtailing their exploration, drilling and production activities, the products and services we design, market and sell and the facilities where we manufacture our products. For example, our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations that, among other things: may regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes; may require acquisition of environmental permits related to its operations; may restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment; may limit or prohibit operational activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; may regulate specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; may require compliance with operational and equipment standards; may impose testing, reporting and record-keeping requirements; and may require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations. Sanctions for noncompliance with such laws and regulations may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties, criminal prosecution and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.\nSome environmental laws and regulations provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, Apergy or its customers may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws and regulations may expose Apergy or its customers to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts or for the acts of our customers that were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time such acts were performed. Any of these laws and regulations could result in claims, fines or expenditures that could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. New laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our customers by limiting or curtailing their exploration, drilling and production activities, which may adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services. Additionally, the implementation of new laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our operations or products or shut down some or all of our facilities.\nNumerous proposals have been made, and are likely to continue to be made, at various levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d). Past sessions of the U.S. Congress considered, but did not enact, legislation to address climate change. The EPA and other federal agencies previously issued regulations that aim to reduce GHG emissions; however, the current administration has generally indicated an interest in scaling back or rescinding regulations addressing GHG emissions, including those affecting the U.S. oil and gas industry. It is difficult to predict the extent to which such policies will be implemented or the outcome of any related litigation. Any regulation of GHG emissions could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions for Apergy and/or its customers and limit or curtail exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers, which could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to complete third party acquisitions on acceptable terms.\nOver time. we expect to acquire value creating, add-on capabilities that broaden our existing technological, geographic, and cost position, thereby complementing our existing businesses. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to find suitable opportunities to purchase or to acquire such capabilities on acceptable terms. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, our revenue growth could be adversely affected. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities, or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications in the oil and gas industry where an accident or a failure of a product can potentially have catastrophic consequences. Risks inherent in these applications, such as equipment malfunctions and failures, equipment misuse and defects, explosions, blowouts and uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, surface and drinking water resources, equipment and the environment. While we currently maintain insurance protection against some of these risks and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring them to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our current insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective enough to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur industry is undergoing continuing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry continues to experience consolidation and as a result, some of our largest customers have consolidated and are using their size and purchasing power to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions. This consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers or the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our level of sales to a customer that has consolidated, or replace that revenue with increased business activity with other customers. As a result, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers may have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on prices, capital spending by our customers, our selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nWe are subject to information technology, cybersecurity and privacy risks.\nWe depend on various information technologies to store and process information and support our business activities. We also manufacture and sell hardware and software to provide monitoring, controls and optimization of customer critical assets in oil and gas production and distribution. We also provide services to maintain these systems. Additionally, our operations rely upon partners, vendors and other third-party providers of information technology software and services. If any of these information technologies, products or services are damaged, cease to properly function, are breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, Apergy or its partners, vendors or other third parties could experience: (i) production downtimes, (ii) operational delays, (iii) the compromising of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal and customer data, (iv) destruction, corruption, or theft of data, (v) security breaches, (vi) other manipulation, disruption, misappropriation or improper use of its systems or networks, (vii) financial losses from remedial actions, (viii) loss of business or potential liability, (ix) adverse media coverage, and (x) legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, and/or damage to its reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, Apergy\u2019s and its partners\u2019, vendors\u2019 and other third-parties\u2019 systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks relating to existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.\nWe continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022\ngovernment export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nlimitations on ownership and on repatriation or dividend of earnings;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nincreased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and\n\u2022\naccess to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy into new geographical markets, our reputation, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNew tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn 2018 the U.S. government imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and a broad range of other products imported into the United States. In response to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, the European Union, Canada, Mexico and China have announced tariffs on U.S. goods and services. The new tariffs have increased our material input costs, and any further trade restrictions, retaliatory trade measures and additional tariffs could result in higher input costs to our products. We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of these increased costs or pass price increases on to our customers. While tariffs and other retaliatory trade measures imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business or results of operations, we cannot predict further developments, and such existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and laws, and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits could adversely affect our business, profitability and reputation.\nOur domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental and employment regulations, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations and other similar programs). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws, regulations and policies could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, as well as damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, Apergy has made investments in certain countries, including Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Colombia and Oman, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, and disagreements with taxing authorities with respect to the interpretation of tax laws and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid could be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws (which have been and may in the future be under active consideration in various jurisdictions) and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. For example, the U.S. bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and imposing limitations on the ability to deduct interest expense. If changes in statutory tax rates or laws or audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on our customers, resulting in lower demand for our products and services.\nFailure to attract, retain and develop personnel for key management could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives. Additionally, during periods of increased investment in the oil and gas industry, competition to hire may increase and the availability of qualified personnel may be reduced. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, market share and competitive position could be adversely affected. Additionally, we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies.\nThe credit risks of our customer base could result in losses.\nMany of our customers are oil and gas companies that have faced or may in the future face liquidity constraints during adverse commodity price environments. These customers impact our overall exposure to credit risk as they are also affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. If a significant number of our customers experience a prolonged business decline or disruptions, we may incur increased exposure to credit risk and bad debts.\nThe loss of one or more significant customers could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur customers represent a combination of some of the largest operators in the oil and gas drilling and production markets, including major integrated, large, medium and small independents, and foreign national oil and gas companies, as well as oilfield equipment and service providers. In 2018, our top 10 customers represented approximately 38% of total revenue. While Apergy is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe inability to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our revenue, operating profits and cash flows.\nWe own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. We employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent our intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur financial results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.\nWe may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances may also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.\nWe are subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production, with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates, global economic conditions and related energy demands. Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and cost of capital.\nA deterioration in our future expected profitability or cash flows could result in an impairment of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets.\nApergy has significant goodwill and intangible assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives to intangible assets involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill. Although fair values currently exceed carrying values for each reporting unit, the value of our business could be unfavorably impacted by steep declines in revenue and order rates as drilling and production activity would be reduced due to sustained unfavorable crude oil prices and lower U.S. rig counts. Accordingly, sustained future economic declines could result in impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nOur operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. In particular, our international operations are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate. While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate such U.S. or international laws or regulations or fail to protect our confidential information. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States or other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related stockholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.\nA portion of our business is transacted and/or denominated in foreign currencies, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Although the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has historically not been material, significant changes in currency exchange rates, principally the Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Argentinian Peso, and Colombian Peso, could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries and could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.\nNatural disasters and unusual weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or severe weather conditions. Hurricanes, tropical storms, flash floods, blizzards, cold weather and other natural disasters or severe weather conditions could result in evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services, damage to equipment and facilities, interruption in transportation of products and materials, and loss of productivity. For example, certain of our manufactured products and components are manufactured at a single facility, and disruptions in operations or damage to any such facilities could reduce our ability to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand. If our customers are unable to operate or are required to reduce operations due to severe weather conditions, our business could be adversely affected as a result of curtailed deliveries of our products and services.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operating flexibility.\nIn connection with the Separation, we incurred a significant amount of indebtedness. Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that governs our senior notes, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify.\nSpecifically, our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our business operations;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that governs our senior notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term interests. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations of our debt.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, as well as any future indebtedness that we may incur, depends upon the level of cash flows generated by our operations, our ability to sell assets, availability under our revolving credit facility, and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, industry, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the oil and gas industry could be impaired.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nPotential indemnification liabilities between Apergy and Dover pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe separation and distribution agreement, among other things, provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Apergy financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Separation. If we are required to indemnify Dover under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with Dover, Dover agreed to indemnify Apergy for certain liabilities. However, third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Dover has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Dover will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Dover will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, Dover\u2019s insurers may attempt to deny coverage to Apergy for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the Separation. Moreover, even if Apergy ultimately succeeds in recovering from Dover or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses until recovery is achieved. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Dover following the Separation.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of Dover may become Apergy\u2019s obligations. For example, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Dover U.S. consolidated group during a taxable period, or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution, is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire Dover U.S. consolidated group for that taxable period. Consequently, we could be required to pay the entire amount of Dover\u2019s consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a prior period, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.\nIf the distribution in connection with the Separation, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Dover could be subject to significant tax liability and, in certain circumstances, Apergy could be required to indemnify Dover for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nPrior to the distribution, Dover received a private letter ruling from the IRS (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) together with an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, tax counsel to Dover, substantially to the effect that, among other things, the contribution and the distribution, taken together, would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, and the distribution would qualify as a tax-free distribution to Dover\u2019s stockholders under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling relies on, and the opinion of tax counsel relies on, certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings from Dover and Apergy, including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, Dover and its stockholders at the time of the Separation may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling or the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine through an audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. In addition, Dover and Apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.\nIf the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Dover and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, Dover would for U.S. federal income tax purposes be treated as if it had sold the Apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and Dover\u2019s stockholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Apergy common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, Dover (and, under the tax matters agreement described below, Apergy) could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law, respectively.\nUnder the tax matters agreement between Dover and Apergy, Apergy would generally be required to indemnify Dover for taxes incurred by Dover that arise as a result of Apergy\u2019s taking, or failing to take, as the case may be, certain actions or any breach of any representations made by Apergy that, in either case, result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code or of such related transactions failing to qualify for tax-free treatment. Also, under the tax matters agreement, Apergy would generally be required to indemnify Dover for one-half of taxes and other liabilities incurred by Dover if the distribution fails to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code for reasons other than an act or failure to act on the part of Apergy or Dover, and therefore Apergy might be required to indemnify Dover for such taxes and liabilities due to circumstances and events not within our control. Under the tax matters agreement, Apergy is also required to indemnify Dover for one-half of certain taxes incurred as a result of the restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the distribution, whether payable upon filing tax returns related to the restructuring and distribution or upon a subsequent audit of those returns. Our indemnification obligations to Dover under the tax matters agreement are not limited by a maximum amount. If we are required to indemnify Dover under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUnder the tax matters agreement between Dover and Apergy, Dover may, in its sole discretion, make protective elections under Section 336(e) of the Code for Apergy and some or all of its domestic subsidiaries with respect to the distribution. If, notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel, the distribution fails to qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, the Section 336(e) elections would generally cause deemed sales of the assets of Apergy and its electing subsidiaries, causing the Dover group to recognize a gain to the extent the fair market value of the assets exceeded the basis of Apergy and\nits electing subsidiaries in such assets. In such case, to the extent that Dover is responsible for the resulting transaction taxes, Apergy generally would be required under the tax matters agreement to make periodic payments to Dover equal to the tax savings arising from a \u201cstep up\u201d in the tax basis of Apergy\u2019s assets.\nWe may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions as a result of the Separation.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Dover and its stockholders at the time of the Separation of the contribution and the distribution and certain related transactions, under the tax matters agreement that Apergy entered into with Dover, Apergy is restricted from taking any action following the distribution that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the distribution, Apergy may be prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting, when combined with prior transactions, in the acquisition of 40% or more of its stock, or substantially all of its assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities representing 40% or more of its stock, subject to certain exceptions and adjustments;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing its capital stock in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct its business or disposing of more than 25% of the assets used in its actively conducted business; and\n\u2022\nengaging in certain internal transactions.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we may be required to indemnify Dover against all or a portion of such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of Apergy\u2019s stock or assets, even if it did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nThe spin-off and related internal restructuring transactions may expose Apergy to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nIf Dover files for bankruptcy or is otherwise determined or deemed to be insolvent under federal bankruptcy laws, a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by Dover in connection with the Separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. A court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon Apergy, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require Apergy\u2019s stockholders to return to Dover some or all of the shares of its common stock issued in the spin-off, or require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transactions for the benefit of creditors.\nThe distribution of Apergy\u2019s common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although Dover made the distribution of Apergy\u2019s common stock entirely out of surplus, we cannot assure you that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distribution to Dover stockholders was unlawful.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous positions at Dover.\nBecause of their former positions with Dover, certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in Dover. Even though our Board of Directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, and our executive officers who were formerly employees of Dover ceased to be employees of Dover upon the Separation, some of our executive officers and directors will continue to have a financial interest in shares of Dover\u2019s common stock. Continuing ownership of shares of Dover\u2019s common stock could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if Apergy and Dover pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for Dover and Apergy.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject following the Separation.\nPrior to the Separation, our financial results were included within the consolidated results of Dover, and we believe that our financial reporting and internal controls were appropriate for a subsidiary of a public company. However, we are now directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019, we will be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to upgrade our systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and/or hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 17783, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "CHX"}
