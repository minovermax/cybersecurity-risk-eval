RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this report, please consider the following discussion of factors that makes an investment in our securities risky. The risks or uncertainties described in this Form 10-K can materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below have been grouped under general risk categories, one or more of which categories may be applicable to the risk factors described. The risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that can harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Commercial, Regulatory and Other Business Matters\nOur success is dependent on our executive management team\u2019s ability to successfully pursue business development, strategic partnerships and investment opportunities to build and grow for the future.\nIn 2017, the Company announced that it was in the process of transforming into a leading diversified, specialty pharmaceutical company with a goal of rapidly de-leveraging its balance sheet, growing its core business and opportunistically building for the future via business development. Since then, we have completed a number of transactions to advance toward achieving our stated goals, including the entry into a Commercialization Agreement with Collegium for our NUCYNTA franchise, the divestiture of Gralise to Alvogen, the divestiture of our remaining rights in the NUCYNTA franchise to Collegium, the repayment in full of our Senior Notes and the repurchase of approximately $188.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding convertible notes. As a result of the transformation from these transactions, we have positioned the Company to actively pursue business development, strategic partnerships, and investment opportunities to build and grow for the future.\nIf our executive management team is not able, in a timely manner, to develop, implement and execute successful business strategies and plans to maintain and increase our product revenues following the execution of the transactions above, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and the existing business may be required to take steps to reduce its costs at some point in time. While our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers have significant industry-related experience, it may take time to develop, implement and execute our business strategies and plans. Any delay in the execution of our business plans by our executive management team, or any future changes to such management team, could affect our ability to develop, implement and execute our business strategies and plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, our future business strategies and plans may differ materially, or may continue to evolve, from those we previously pursued. If our business strategies and plans, or our efforts to realize future operational efficiencies, cause disruption in our business or operations or do not achieve the level of success or results we anticipate, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully commercialize CAMBIA and Zipsor, or Alvogen does not successfully commercialize Gralise, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nIn October 2011, we began commercial sales of Gralise\u00ae. Effective as of January 10, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to Gralise to Alvogen. Under the terms of the agreement, Alvogen will pay us 75% of its first $70.0 million of Gralise net sales after the closing. In June 2012, we acquired Zipsor and began commercial promotion of Zipsor in July 2012. In December 2013, we acquired CAMBIA and began commercial promotion of CAMBIA in February 2014. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this section, our ability to successfully commercialize and generate revenues from CAMBIA and Zipsor, and Alvogen\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize and generate revenues from Gralise, depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our and Alvogen\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\ndevelop and execute our sales and marketing strategies for our products and Gralise;\n\u2022\nachieve, maintain and grow market acceptance of, and demand for, our products and Gralise;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing from managed care, government and other third-party payers;\n\u2022\nmaintain, manage or scale the necessary sales, marketing, manufacturing, managed markets and other capabilities and infrastructure that are required to successfully integrate and commercialize our products and Gralise;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate supply of our products and Gralise;\n\u2022\nmaintain and extend intellectual property protection for our products and Gralise; and\n\u2022\ncomply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nIf we and Alvogen are unable to successfully achieve or perform these functions, we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of our products, and we depend on third parties that are single source suppliers to manufacture our products. Insufficient availability of our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients and other raw materials necessary to manufacture our products, or the inability of our suppliers to manufacture and supply our products, will adversely impact our sales upon depletion of the active ingredient and product inventories.\nWe have one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of CAMBIA and Zipsor. Catalent Ontario Limited (Catalent), which is located in Ontario, Canada, is our sole supplier for Zipsor pursuant to a manufacturing agreement we entered into with Catalent effective June 30, 2018. MiPharm, S.p.A, which is located in Milan, Italy, is our sole supplier for CAMBIA pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of CAMBIA in December 2013. We do not have, and we do not intend to establish in the foreseeable future, internal commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. Rather, we intend to use the facilities of third parties to manufacture products for commercialization and clinical trials. Our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products and our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to obtain such products on a timely or competitive basis, if at all. Any stock out, quality concern or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of CAMBIA or Zipsor, or the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients or components, from our suppliers would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated, and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We, our third-party manufacturers and our suppliers are subject to numerous regulations, including current FDA regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping, product serialization and quality standards. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any third-party manufacturer or supplier fails to perform as required or fails to comply with the regulations of the FDA and other applicable governmental authorities, our ability to deliver adequate supplies of our products to our customers on a timely basis, or to continue our clinical trials, could be adversely affected. The manufacturing processes of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers may also be found to violate the proprietary rights of others. To the extent these risks materialize and adversely affect such third-party manufacturers\u2019 and/or suppliers\u2019 performance obligations to us, and we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms, or if we encounter delays and difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers or suppliers, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur commercialization, collaborative and other arrangements may give rise to disputes over commercial terms, contract interpretation and ownership or protection of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products.\nWe currently have collaboration or license arrangements with a number of companies, including Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Nuvo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and PDL BioPharma, Inc. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future enter into other commercialization or collaborative arrangements, some of which have been based on less definitive agreements, such as memoranda of understanding, material transfer agreements, options or feasibility agreements. We may not execute definitive agreements formalizing these arrangements.\nCommercialization and collaborative relationships are generally complex and can give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of the parties, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations, especially when the applicable collaborative provisions have not been fully negotiated and documented. Such disputes can delay collaborative research, development or commercialization of potential products, and can lead to lengthy, expensive litigation or arbitration. The terms of such arrangements may also limit or preclude us from commercializing products or technologies developed pursuant to such collaborations. Additionally, the commercialization or collaborative partners under these arrangements might breach the terms of their respective agreements or fail to maintain, protect or prevent\ninfringement of the licensed patents or our other intellectual property rights by third parties. Moreover, negotiating commercialization and collaborative arrangements often takes considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate, which could cause us to enter into less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs. Any failure by our commercialization or collaborative partners to abide by the terms of their respective agreements with us (including their failure to accurately calculate, report or pay any royalties payable to either us or a third party or their failure to repay, in full or in part, either any outstanding receivables or any other amounts for which we are entitled to reimbursement) may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are not always able to enter into commercialization or collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, which can harm our ability to develop and commercialize our current and potential future products and technologies. Other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include:\n\u2022\nany parallel development by a commercialization or collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products;\n\u2022\narrangements with commercialization or collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies;\n\u2022\npremature termination of a commercialization or collaboration agreement or the inability to renegotiate existing agreements on favorable terms; or\n\u2022\nfailure by a commercialization or collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using our current and potential future products and technologies.\nOur commercialization or collaborative arrangements do not necessarily restrict our commercialization or collaborative partners from competing with us or restrict their ability to market or sell competitive products. Our current and any future commercialization or collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being commercialized or developed in collaboration with us.\nIn addition, contract disputes with customers or other third parties may arise from time to time. Our commercialization or collaborative partners, or customers or other third parties, may also terminate their relationships with us or otherwise decide not to proceed with the development, commercialization or purchase of our products.\nWe and our commercial partners may be unable to compete successfully in the pharmaceutical industry.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense and we expect competition to increase. Competing products currently under development or developed in the future may prove superior to our products and may achieve greater commercial acceptance. Most of our principal competitors have substantially greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we and our commercial partners do.\nBranded gabapentin is currently sold by Pfizer as Neurontin for adjunctive therapy for partial onset epileptic seizures and for the management of PHN. Pfizer\u2019s basic U.S. patents relating to Neurontin have expired, and numerous companies have received approval to market generic versions of the immediate-release product. In addition to receiving approval for marketing to treat neuropathic pain associated with DPN, Lyrica (pregabalin) has also been approved for marketing in the U.S. for the treatment of post-herpetic pain, fibromyalgia, adjunctive therapy for partial onset epileptic seizures and nerve pain associated with spinal cord injury and has captured a significant portion of the market. Moreover, Pfizer\u2019s patents relating to Lyrica have expired, and generic versions of Lyrica (pregabalin) launched in July 2019. In January 2018, Pfizer began to sell Lyrica CR (pregabalin extended-release tablets), a once-daily treatment for the management of DPN and PHN. Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC\u2019s Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets) is approved for the management of PHN and Restless Leg Syndrome. There are other products prescribed for or under development for PHN which are now or may become competitive with Gralise.\nAn alternate formulation of diclofenac is the active ingredient in CAMBIA that is approved in the U.S. for the acute treatment of migraines in adults. CAMBIA competes with a number of triptans that are used to treat migraines and certain other headaches. Currently, eight triptans are available generically and sold in the U.S. (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, sumatriptan-naproxen and zolmitriptan). Branded competitors include Zomig Nasal Spray, Onzetra, Xsail, Sumavel, Zembrace SymTouch and Treximet, which is a fixed-dose combination product containing sumatriptan and naproxen. There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment or prevention of migraines that are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA, including CGRP inhibitor products.\nDiclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zipsor, is an NSAID that is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mild to moderate pain in adults, including the symptoms of arthritis. Both branded and generic versions of diclofenac are marketed in the U.S. Zipsor competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate pain in the acute setting. In addition, a number of other companies are developing NSAIDs in a variety of dosage forms for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related indications. Other drugs are in clinical development to treat acute pain.\nIf we or our commercialization partners are unable to negotiate acceptable pricing or obtain adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, our business will suffer.\nSales of our products depend significantly on the availability of acceptable pricing and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers such as:\n\u2022\ngovernment health administration authorities;\n\u2022\nprivate health insurers;\n\u2022\nhealth maintenance organizations;\n\u2022\nmanaged care organizations;\n\u2022\npharmacy benefit management companies; and\n\u2022\nother healthcare-related organizations.\nIf reimbursement is not available for our products or product candidates, demand for our products may be limited. Further, any delay in receiving approval for reimbursement from third-party payers could have an adverse effect on our future revenues.\nThird-party payers frequently require pharmaceutical companies to negotiate agreements that provide discounts or rebates from list prices and that protect the payers from price increases above a specified annual limit. We and our commercialization partners have agreed to provide such discounts and rebates to certain third-party payers. We expect increasing pressure to offer larger discounts and rebates or discounts and rebates to a greater number of third-party payers to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels for and access to our products for patients at co-pay levels that are reasonable and customary. Consolidation among large third-party payers may increase their leverage in negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. If we or our commercialization partners are forced to provide additional discounts and rebates to third-party payers to maintain acceptable access to our products for patients, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. If third-party payers do not accurately and timely report the eligibility and utilization of our products under their plans, our reserves for rebates or other amounts payable to third-party payers may be lower than the amount we are invoiced and we may be required to dispute the amount payable, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we have had, and continue to have, disputes with managed care providers over rebates related to our products. Even when rebate claims made by such managed care providers are without merit, we may be forced to pay such disputed amounts to the extent our failure to do so could otherwise adversely impact our business, such as our ability to maintain a favorable position on such provider\u2019s formulary. In addition, if competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce sales of our products and harm our results of operations. The process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that such third-party payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication, including one or more of our products. Any third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursement of, our products, including by reducing, limiting or denying reimbursement for new products or excluding products that were previously eligible for reimbursement, would limit the market acceptance and commercial prospects of our products and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any third-party payer decision to impose restrictions, limitations or conditions on prescribing or reimbursement of our products, including on the dosing or duration of prescriptions for our products, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been, and there will continue to be, legislative, regulatory and third-party payer proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to commercialize our products profitably. We anticipate that the federal and state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt and implement healthcare policies, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost-containment measures may include: controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government healthcare programs; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to or limits on the pricing of drugs, including pricing controls or limits or prohibitions on\nreimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third-party payers to make coverage and payment decisions. In California, voters rejected Proposition 61 in November 2016, a ballot initiative that would have prohibited the state from buying prescription drugs from a drug manufacturer at a price over the lowest price paid for such drug by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Although Proposition 61 was defeated, these and other cost-containment or price-control measures, if adopted at the federal or state level, could significantly decrease the price that we or our commercialization partners receive for our products and any product that we may develop or acquire, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our products, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the FDA can approve an ANDA for a generic version of a branded drug without the ANDA applicant undertaking the clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. In place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product has the same active ingredient(s) and is bioequivalent to the branded product, in addition to any data necessary to establish that any difference in strength, dosage, form, inactive ingredients or delivery mechanism does not result in different safety or efficacy profiles, as compared to the reference drug.\nThe FDCA requires an applicant for a drug that relies, at least in part, on the patent of one of our branded drugs to notify us of its application and potential infringement of our patent rights. Upon receipt of this notice, we would have 45 days to bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against the company seeking approval of a product covered by one of our patents. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such suits can take several years. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit triggers a one-time automatic 30-month stay of the FDA\u2019s ability to approve the competitor\u2019s application. Such litigation is often time-consuming and quite costly and may result in generic competition if the patents at issue are not upheld or if the generic competitor is found not to infringe such patents. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30-month stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the standards for approval of ANDAs.\nAny introduction of one or more products generic to Gralise, CAMBIA, or Zipsor, whether as a result of an ANDA or otherwise, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The filing of the ANDAs described above, or any other ANDA or similar application in respect to any of our products, could have an adverse impact on our stock price. Moreover, if the patents covering our products are not upheld in litigation or if a generic competitor is found not to infringe these patents, the resulting generic competition would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness interruptions can limit our ability to operate our business and adversely impact the success of our commercialization partners.\nOur operations and infrastructure, and those of our partners, third-party suppliers, manufacturers and vendors are vulnerable to damage or interruption from cyber-attacks and security breaches, human error, natural disasters, fire, flood, the effects of climate change, actual or threatened public health crises, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, intentional acts of theft, vandalism, terrorism, public health crises and similar events. We have not established a formal disaster recovery plan, and our back-up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations.\nData breaches and cyber-attacks can compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, maintain and transmit sensitive data on our computer networks and information technology systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack and motives (including corporate espionage). Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted to target our information systems. Cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications and those of our third-party vendors may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator\nerror, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\nAlthough our Board of Directors, through our Audit Committee, regularly discusses with management our policies and practices regarding information technology systems, information management systems and related infrastructure, including our information technology and information management security, risk management and back-up policies, practices and infrastructure, it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage that may be caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information, including our financial information or the information of our business partners. Cyber-attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. Our network security and data recovery measures and those of our third party vendors may not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our business.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of our executive management team with whom we do not have employment agreements.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of members of our executive management team, and on our ability to attract and retain key management and operating personnel. We do not have agreements with any of our executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us. Management, scientific and operating personnel are in high demand in our industry and are often subject to competing offers. The loss of the services of one or more members of management or key employees or the inability to hire additional personnel as needed could result in delays in the research, development and commercialization of our products and potential product candidates, or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nThe development of drug candidates is inherently difficult and uncertain, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates or those of our collaborative partners will be approved for marketing or, if approved, will achieve market acceptance.\nClinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays and failures. As a condition to regulatory approval, each product candidate must undergo extensive and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate to a statistically significant degree that the product candidate is safe and effective. The results at any stage of the development process may lack the desired safety, efficacy or pharmacokinetic characteristics. Positive or encouraging results of prior clinical trials are not necessarily indicative of the results obtained in later clinical trials, as has occurred in the past in certain of our Phase 3 trials. Further, product candidates in later clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed in development. In addition, data obtained from pivotal clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nProduct candidates are subject to the risk that any or all of them may be found to be ineffective or unsafe, or otherwise may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances. The FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies may determine that our data is not sufficiently compelling to warrant marketing approval and require us to engage in additional clinical trials or provide further analysis, which may be costly and time-consuming. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even in advanced clinical trials after showing positive results in preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials. If our current or future product candidates fail at any stage of development, they will not receive regulatory approval, we will not be able to commercialize them and we will not receive any return on our investment in those product candidates.\nOther factors could delay or result in the termination of our or our collaborative partner\u2019s current and future clinical trials and related development programs, including:\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results;\n\u2022\npatient enrollment rates;\n\u2022\npatient noncompliance with the protocol;\n\u2022\nadverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials;\n\u2022\nany findings resulting from FDA inspections of clinical operations;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet FDA preferred or recommended clinical trial design, end points or statistical power;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with good clinical practices;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party clinical trial vendors to comply with applicable regulatory laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ninability of third-party clinical trial vendors to satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations, comply with applicable laws and regulations or meet deadlines;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining clinical materials or manufacturing sufficient quantities of the product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in recruiting qualified patients to participate in clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nactual or perceived lack of efficacy or safety of the product candidate.\nWe are unable to predict whether any product candidates will receive regulatory clearances or be successfully manufactured or marketed. Further, due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained, the time frame for commercializing a product is long and uncertain. Even if product candidates receive regulatory clearance, these products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance. If it is discovered that our or our collaborators\u2019 products or technologies have potential adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate they may be ineffective as therapeutics, our product development efforts and our business could be significantly harmed.\nEven assuming our or our collaborative partners\u2019 products obtain regulatory approval, successful commercialization requires:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance;\n\u2022\na cost-effective commercial-scale production; and\n\u2022\nreimbursement under private or governmental health plans.\nAny material delay or failure in the governmental approval process, the successful production of commercial product or the successful commercialization of our approved product candidates, or those of our collaborative partners, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our collaborative partners customarily depend on third-party contract research organizations, clinical investigators and clinical sites to conduct clinical trials with regard to product candidates, and if they do not perform their regulatory, legal and contractual obligations, or successfully enroll patients in and manage our clinical trials, we and our collaborative partners may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for product candidates.\nWe and our collaborative partners customarily rely on third-party contract research organizations and other third parties to assist us in designing, managing, monitoring and otherwise conducting clinical trials. We and our collaborative partners do not control these third parties and, as a result, we and our collaborative partners may be unable to control the amount and timing of resources that they devote to our or our collaborative partners\u2019 clinical trials.\nAlthough we and our collaborative partners rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials, we and our collaborative partners are responsible for confirming that each clinical trial is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol, as well as the FDA\u2019s and other applicable regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements, including good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. If we, contract research organizations or other third parties assisting us or our collaborative partners with clinical trials fail to comply with applicable good clinical practices, the clinical data generated in such clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, or other applicable regulatory agencies, may require us or our collaborative partners to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications with regard to product candidates. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies will determine that any of our clinical trials or our collaborative partners comply with good clinical practices. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and similar regulations outside of the U.S. Our or our collaborative partners\u2019 failure, or the failure of our product manufacturers, to comply with these regulations may require the repeat or redesign of clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nWe and our collaborative partners also customarily rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties to manage clinical trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. If clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in such clinical trials or fail to enroll them on the planned schedule,\nthese trials may not be completed or completed as planned, which could delay or prevent us or our collaborative partners from obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates.\nAgreements with clinical investigators and clinical sites for clinical testing and for trial management services place substantial responsibilities on these parties, which could result in delays in, or termination of, clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical protocols or for other reasons, clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we and our collaborative partners may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, product candidates.\nFailure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our products, our raw materials or product candidates, will limit our ability to commercialize our products, and our business will suffer.\nThe regulatory process is expensive and time consuming. Even after investing significant time and expenditures on clinical trials, we may not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates. Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and the FDA may not agree with our methods of clinical data analysis or our conclusions regarding safety and/or efficacy. Significant clinical trial delays could impair our ability to commercialize our products and could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. In addition, changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections. Even if we receive regulatory approval, this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product.\nFurther, with respect to our approved products, once regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review and other requirements. The FDA recently notified the Company it would require two post-marketing studies related to Gralise. In addition, the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or manufacturing facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation and inspection, including compliance with FDA regulations governing cGMP or Quality System Regulation (QSR). The FDCA, the CSA and other federal and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. In addition, we and our partners are also subject to ongoing DEA regulatory obligations, including annual registration renewal, security, record keeping, theft and loss reporting, periodic inspection and annual quota allotments for the raw material for commercial production of our products. The failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, non-renewal of marketing applications or authorizations or criminal prosecution, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also required to report adverse events associated with our products to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of the FDA or other empowered regulatory agencies. For example, in June 2010, we instituted a voluntary class 2 recall of 52 lots of our 500mg Glumetza product after chemical traces of 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) were found in the product bottle.\nWe are subject to risks associated with NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA.\nThe products we and our collaborative partners develop or acquire generally are or will be submitted for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For instance, the NDA for Cambia relies on the FDA\u2019s prior approval of Cataflam, the diclofenac initially approved by the FDA.\nFor NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, the patent certification and related provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act apply. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, such NDAs may be required to include certifications, known as \u201cParagraph IV certifications,\u201d that certify any patents listed in the Orange Book publication in respect to any product referenced in the 505(b)(2) application are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) application. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder of the NDA which the 505(b)(2) application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification. Filing of a patent infringement lawsuit triggers a one-time automatic 30-month stay of the FDA\u2019s ability to approve the 505(b)\n(2) application. Accordingly, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before such products may be commercialized, if at all. A Section 505(b)(2) application may also not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. The FDA may also require us to perform one or more additional clinical studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new formulation for all or only some of the indications sought by us. If the FDA disagrees with the use of the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for product candidates, we would need to reconsider our plans and might not be able to obtain approval for product candidates in a timely or cost-efficient manner, or at all. The FDA may also reject our future Section 505(b)(2) submissions and may require us to file such submissions under Section 501(b)(1) of the FDCA, which could be considerably more expensive and time-consuming.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to risks from changes in laws and regulations applicable to, and increased scrutiny and investigations of, the pharmaceutical industry, including the opioid market, which can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to, and increased scrutiny and investigations of, the pharmaceutical industry, including the opioid market, could adversely affect our business and our ability to commercialize CAMBIA and Zipsor as well as Alvogen\u2019s ability to commercialize Gralise, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, various federal and state governmental entities, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a number of state attorneys general, have launched investigations into the marketing and sales practices of pharmaceutical companies that market or have marketed opioid and non-opioid pain medications, including us. For instance, we have received subpoenas or civil investigative demands from the DOJ, several state attorneys general, the New York Department of Financial Services and other state regulators seeking documentation and information in connection with our historical sales and marketing of opioid products. We also received a subpoena from the State of California Department of Insurance (CDI) seeking information relating to our historical sales and marketing of Gralise. There has been recent regulatory attention focused on gabapentin as a result of a perceived risk of the compound being used as a potentiator for opioid abuse. Although gabapentin is neither an opioid nor classified as a controlled substance by the DEA, as a result of the perceived risks relating to substance abuse, several states have scheduled gabapentin as a controlled substance. We have also received notice from the FDA that it has requested that all companies that hold an NDA for gabapentanoids conduct two clinical trials to assess gabapentin\u2019s abuse liability. One clinical trial is intended to address the abuse potential of gabapentin alone. The other clinical trial is intended to evaluate gabapentin\u2019s abuse potential when taken in combination with an opioid drug. Depending on the results of these studies, additional safety labeling, the implementation of a REMS protocol and/or scheduling of gabapentanoids, as a class or by formulation type, could be mandated by the FDA which, in turn, could result in increased expenses or have a material adverse impact on either the commercial prospects of our products or our ability or our partners\u2019 ability to commercialize our products. Continued changes in regulations and legislation applicable to gabapentin could have a material adverse impact on the commercial prospects of Gralise which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on Alvogen\u2019s sales and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulators could take measures that could have a negative effect on our business and our products. Any negative regulatory request or action taken by a regulatory agency, including the FDA, with respect to our other products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe regulatory actions described above, as well as the related litigation and investigations, not only create financial and operational pressure on our company, but could also put pressure on other companies in our industry and with which we have contractual arrangements. Such pressures could negatively impact our contractual counterparties and may give rise to contract cancellations, breaches or rejections in bankruptcy. Furthermore, in the event that a contract counterparty seeks to reject a contract, we may have an unsecured claim for damages, which may not be paid in full (if at all), and we may be forced to return payments made within 90 days of the date of filing for bankruptcy protection. If any of these events should occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe foregoing and other similar initiatives and actions, whether taken by governmental authorities or other industry stakeholders, may result in the reduced availability, prescribing, sales and use of our products, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize CAMBIA and Zipsor, as well as Alvogen\u2019s ability to commercialize Gralise, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPharmaceutical marketing is subject to substantial regulation in the U.S. and any failure by us or our commercial and collaborative partners to comply with applicable statutes or regulations can adversely affect our business.\nAll marketing activities of Alvogen associated with Gralise, and our current marketing activities associated with CAMBIA and Zipsor, as well as marketing activities related to any other products that we may acquire, or for which we or our collaborative partners obtain regulatory approval, are and will be subject to numerous federal and state laws governing the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising to ensure that they conform to statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition to FDA restrictions, the marketing of prescription drugs is subject to laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse under government healthcare programs. For example, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits giving things of value to induce the prescribing or purchase of products that are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Under these laws, in recent years, the federal government has brought claims against drug manufacturers alleging that certain marketing activities caused false claims for prescription drugs to be submitted to federal programs. Many states have similar statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, and, in some states, such statutes or regulations apply regardless of the payer.\nGovernmental authorities may also seek to hold us responsible for any failure of our commercialization or collaborative partners to comply with applicable statutes or regulations. If we, or our commercial or collaborative partners, fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations or other laws or regulations relating to the marketing of our products, we could be subject to criminal prosecution, civil penalties, seizure of products, injunctions and exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, as well as other regulatory or investigatory actions against our product candidates, our commercial or collaborative partners or us.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting or have in the past promoted the \u201coff-label\u201d use of drugs.\nCompanies may not promote drugs for \u201coff-label\u201d use-that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe drug products for off-label uses, and such off-label uses are common across some medical specialties. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatments, the FDCA and FDA regulations restrict communications on the subject of off-label uses of drug products by pharmaceutical companies. The Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the FDA, and the DOJ all actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label use and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If any of the investigations of the DOJ, the attorneys general identified above, and the CDI, as well as the actions filed by states and municipalities against us, result in a finding that we engaged in wrongdoing, including sales and marketing practices for our current and future products that violate applicable laws and regulations, we would be subject to significant liabilities. Such liabilities would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as divert management\u2019s attention from our business operations and damage our reputation. For additional information regarding potential liability, see also \u201c - Governmental investigations and inquiries, regulatory actions and lawsuits brought against us by government agencies and private parties with respect to our historical commercialization of opioids can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nHealthcare reform can increase our expenses and adversely affect the commercial success of our products.\nThe ACA includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies. For example, the ACA seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The ACA also imposes substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit and an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S. The ACA also requires increased disclosure obligations and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics and contains cost-containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products. The ACA also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. These and other aspects of the ACA, including regulations that may be imposed in connection with the implementation of the ACA, such as the 340B Program (which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to eligible healthcare organizations and covered entities at\nsignificantly reduced prices), could increase our expenses and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.\nMany members of Congress and President Trump have pledged to repeal the ACA. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorized Congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the ACA and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump also issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration\u2019s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the ACA and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of burdensome provisions of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. Although several attempts to repeal and replace the ACA failed to pass both houses of Congress or have been limited or rejected by federal courts, there is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump\u2019s administration and the Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, as will the ACA-related lawsuits that are working their way through the federal judicial system. Any new laws or regulations that have the effect of imposing additional costs or regulatory burden on pharmaceutical manufacturers, or otherwise negatively affect the industry, could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates. In addition, President Trump, members of Congress, and state elected officials have indicated that reducing the price of prescription drugs will be a priority. The implementation of any price controls, caps on prescription drugs or price transparency requirements, whether at the federal level or state level, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Historical Commercialization of Opioids\nGovernmental investigations and inquiries, regulatory actions and lawsuits brought against us by government agencies and private parties with respect to our historical commercialization of opioids can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the greater public awareness of the public health issue of opioid abuse, there has been increased scrutiny of, and investigation into, the commercial practices of opioid manufacturers generally by federal, state and local regulatory and governmental agencies, as well as increased legal action brought by state and local governmental entities and private parties. For example, we are currently named as a defendant, along with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of opioid drugs, in multiple lawsuits alleging common-law and statutory causes of action for alleged misleading or otherwise improper marketing and promotion of opioid drugs. Such litigation and related matters are described in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nIn March 2017, we received a letter from Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), the then-Ranking Member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, requesting certain information regarding our historical commercialization of opioid products. We voluntarily furnished information responsive to Sen. McCaskill\u2019s request. We have also received subpoenas or civil investigative demands focused on historical promotion and sales of Lazanda, NUCYNTA, and NUCYNTA ER from various state attorneys general seeking documents and information regarding our historical sales and marketing of opioid products. In addition, the CDI has issued a subpoena to us seeking information relating to our historical sales and marketing of Lazanda. The CDI subpoena also seeks information on Gralise, a non-opioid product which we recently divested to Alvogen. We have also received subpoenas from the DOJ and the New York Department of Financial Services seeking documents and information regarding our historical sales and marketing of opioid products. We also from time to time receive and comply with subpoenas from governmental authorities related to investigations primarily focused on third parties, including healthcare practitioners. We are cooperating with the foregoing governmental investigations and inquiries. These matters are described in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nThese and other governmental investigations or inquiries, as well as lawsuits, in which we are and may become involved may result in additional claims and lawsuits being brought against us by governmental agencies or private parties. It is not possible at this time to predict either the outcome or the potential financial impact of the opioid-related lawsuits mentioned above or any governmental investigations or inquiries of us or any lawsuits or regulatory responses that may result from such investigations or inquiries or otherwise. It is also not possible at this time to predict the additional expenses related to such ongoing opioid-related litigation and investigations, which may be significant. The initiation of any additional investigation, inquiry or lawsuit relating to us, the costs and expenses associated therewith, or any assertion, claim or finding of wrongdoing by us, could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nresult in reputational harm and reduced market acceptance and demand for our products;\n\u2022\nharm our ability and our commercial partners\u2019 ability to market our products;\n\u2022\ncause us to incur significant liabilities, costs and expenses; and\n\u2022\ncause our senior management to be distracted from execution of our business strategy.\nFurthermore, these pending investigations, inquiries and lawsuits could negatively affect our ability to raise capital and impair our ability to engage in strategic transactions.\nWe face risks relating to product liability losses and other litigation liability for which we may be unable to maintain or obtain adequate protection.\nWe are or may be involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and certain government inquiries and investigations, including with respect to, but not limited to, patent infringement, product liability, personal injury, antitrust matters, securities class action lawsuits, breach of contract, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement claims, opioid-related matters, promotional practices and compliance with laws relating to the manufacture and sale of controlled substances. For example, we, along with other opioid manufacturers and, often, distributors, have been named in lawsuits related to the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and promotion of opioids. In addition, we have also received various subpoenas and requests for information related to the distribution, marketing and sale of our opioid products. Moreover, our primary product liability insurer has sought a declaratory judgment that opioid litigation claims noticed by us are not covered by our policies with such insurer. Such litigation and related matters are described in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d If any of these legal proceedings, inquiries or investigations were to result in an adverse outcome, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance for sales of our products and clinical trials currently underway, but:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future products; or\n\u2022\nour insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities (including pending and future claims relating to opioid litigation), or may provide no protection at all.\nOur inability to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. Defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management\u2019s attention from conducting our business. If third parties were to bring a successful product liability or other claims, or series of claims, against us for uninsured liabilities, or in excess of our insured liability limits, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are not always able to protect our intellectual property and are subject to risks from liability for infringing the intellectual property of others.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies, and to preserve our trade secrets. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. We hold issued U.S. patents and have patent applications pending in the U.S. In addition, we are pursuing patent applications relating to our technologies in the U.S. and abroad. We have also applied for patents in numerous foreign countries. Some of those countries have granted our applications and other applications are still pending. Our pending patent applications may lack priority over other applications or may not result in the issuance of patents. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know-how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases, due to, among other things, the lack of an adequate remedy for breach of an agreement or a finding that an agreement is unenforceable. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nOur ability to develop our technologies and to make commercial sales of products using our technologies also depends on not infringing other patents or intellectual property rights. We are not aware of any such intellectual property claims directly\nagainst us. The pharmaceutical industry has experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Patents issued to third parties relating to sustained release drug formulations or particular pharmaceutical compounds could in the future be asserted against us, although we believe that we do not infringe any valid claim of any patents. If claims concerning any of our products were to arise and it was determined that these products infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights, we or our commercial partners could be subject to substantial damages for past infringement or could be forced to stop or delay activities with respect to any infringing product, unless we or our commercial partner, as applicable, can obtain a license, or our product may need to be redesigned so that it does not infringe upon such third party\u2019s patent rights, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we, our collaborators or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us, even if such claims are without merit, could cause our stock price to decline.\nFrom time to time, we may become aware of activities by third-parties that may infringe our patents. Infringement of our patents by others may reduce our market shares (if a related product is approved) and, consequently, our potential future revenues and adversely affect our patent rights if we do not take appropriate enforcement action. We may need to engage in litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. For instance, we have previously been engaged in ANDA litigation involving NUCYNTA, NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA oral solution as well as Gralise and Zipsor. It is possible our issued or licensed patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Whether or not the outcome of litigation or the PTAB proceeding is favorable to us, the litigation and the proceedings may take significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. We may also be required to participate in derivation proceedings or other post-grant proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the purposes of, respectively, determining the priority of inventions in connection with our patent applications or determining validity of claims in our issued patents. Adverse determinations in litigation or proceedings at the USPTO could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. If we need but cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from marketing the affected product.\nSettlements to ANDA litigation can be challenged and have the potential to lead to significant damage awards.\nIn circumstances where we settle patent litigation claims asserted against generic drug companies, the terms of these settlements have the potential to generate new litigation. For example, we were recently named as a co-defendant in a putative class action brought by certain direct and indirect purchasers of Glumetza (metformin), which was previously the subject of ANDA patent litigation. The plaintiffs in this action allege that a term of the settlement agreement violated antitrust laws and thus subsequently led to higher prices for Glumetza. While we believe we have substantive defenses to this action, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in this action. To the extent that we or our co-defendants are found to have acted improperly, we could be jointly and severally liable for a significant damages award, which could potentially exceed our ability to pay. Entry into other patent litigation settlement agreements in the future subjects us to additional potential claims challenging these settlements under antitrust laws or other novel theories.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nOur existing capital resources are not necessarily sufficient to fund our future operations or product acquisitions and strategic transactions that we may pursue.\nWe fund our operations primarily through revenues from product sales and do not have any committed sources of capital. To the extent that our existing capital resources and revenues from ongoing operations are insufficient to fund our future operations, or product acquisitions and strategic transactions that we may pursue, or our litigation-related costs, we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities, through additional debt financing, from development and licensing arrangements or from the sale of assets. We may be unable to raise such additional capital on a timely basis and on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 equity positions.\nOur failure to generate sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness under the convertible notes we issued in September 2014 and August 2019 (collectively, the Convertible Notes). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to\nrefinance the Convertible Notes and any additional debt obligations we may incur depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or if our results of operations cause us to fail to comply with our financial covenants, we may be required to take one or more actions, including refinancing our debt, significantly reducing expenses, renegotiating our debt covenants, restructuring our debt, selling assets or obtaining additional capital, each of which may be on terms that may be onerous, highly dilutive or disruptive to our business. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms, which could result in a default on our obligations, including the Convertible Notes.\nWe may seek to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness in the future. Any such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and business and financial conditions at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive terms if or when desired or at all.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under the Convertible Notes or our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nresult in other events of default under our Convertible Notes or our other indebtedness, which events of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including funding possible acquisitions of, or investments in, new and complementary businesses, products and technologies, which is a key element of our corporate strategy;\n\u2022\nsubject us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nrequire the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including working capital, clinical trials, research and development, business development activities, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes in the event we are required to do so following a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d as specified in the indentures governing the Convertible Notes, or to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash;\n\u2022\nresult in dilution to our existing shareholders as a result of the conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022\nput us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nAny of these factors can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nAcquisition of new and complementary businesses, products and technologies is a key element of our corporate strategy. Failure to successfully identify and acquire such businesses, products or technologies will limit our business growth and prospects.\nAn important element of our business strategy is to actively seek to acquire products or companies and to in-license or seek co-promotion rights to additional products. For example, in the past we have acquired NUCYNTA, NUCYNTA ER (both of which were subsequently divested to Collegium in February 2020), CAMBIA, and Zipsor, amongst other acquisitions. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully identify, pursue and complete any further acquisitions or whether we would be able to successfully integrate or develop any acquired business, product or technology or retain any key employees. If we are unable to enhance and broaden our product offerings, our business and prospects will be limited.\nStrategic transactions that fail to achieve the anticipated results and synergies will cause our business to suffer.\nWe sometimes seek to engage in strategic transactions with third parties, such as product or company acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, divestitures or business combinations. We may face significant competition in seeking potential strategic partners and transactions, and the negotiation process for acquiring any product or engaging in strategic transactions can be time-consuming and complex. Engaging in strategic transactions, such as our acquisition in 2015 of the rights to NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, our completion in 2018 of the commercialization arrangement covering NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER with Collegium, and our divestiture of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER to Collegium in 2020, may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, pose integration challenges and fail to achieve the anticipated results or synergies or distract our management and business, which may harm our business.\nAs part of an effort to acquire a product or company or to enter into other strategic transactions, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying, evaluating and assessing material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining, evaluating and accurately assessing all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction. We may also assume liabilities and legal risks in connection with a transaction, including those relating to activities of the seller prior to the consummation of the transaction and contracts that we assume. Failure to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions or strategic transactions that we may consummate, or that we have completed, such as the acquisition in 2015 of the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, the commercialization arrangement covering NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER with Collegium, and our divestiture of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER to Collegium in 2020, whether as a result of identified or unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks, governmental investigations, independent actions of or financial position of our collaborative partners, litigation or other events, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to integrate any business, product or technology we acquire, will cause our business, financial condition and operating results to suffer.\nIntegrating any business, product or technology we acquire is expensive and time-consuming and can disrupt and adversely affect our ongoing business, including product sales, and distract our management. Our ability to successfully integrate any business, product or technology we acquire depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022\nminimize the disruption and distraction of our management and other employees, including our sales force, in connection with the integration of any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u2022\nmaintain and increase sales of our existing products;\n\u2022\nestablish or manage the transition of the manufacture and supply of any acquired product, including the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients and components;\n\u2022\nidentify and add the necessary sales, marketing, manufacturing, regulatory and other related personnel, capabilities and infrastructure that are required to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u2022\nmanage the transition and migration of all commercial, financial, legal, clinical, regulatory and other pertinent information relating to any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u2022\ncomply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing from managed care, government and other third-party payers with respect to any acquired product; and\n\u2022\nmaintain and extend intellectual property protection for any acquired product or technology.\nIf we are unable to perform the above functions or otherwise effectively integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results will suffer.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash, or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain events, including events deemed to be a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to\nsettle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted.\nHowever, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes or pay cash with respect to Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indentures governing the Convertible Notes could constitute an event of default under the indentures governing the Convertible Notes and any agreements that may govern any future indebtedness. Following an event of default, if the payment of our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been volatile. Our results of operations have and may continue to fluctuate and affect our stock price.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors affecting our operating results and that could adversely affect our stock price include:\n\u2022\nthe degree of commercial success and market acceptance of Gralise, CAMBIA and Zipsor;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of our opioid-related investigations, our opioid-related litigation brought by state and local governmental entities and private parties, and our insurance, antitrust and other litigation, and the costs and expenses associated therewith;\n\u2022\nfilings and other regulatory or governmental actions, investigations or proceedings related to our products and product candidates and those of our commercialization and collaborative partners;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents, infringement allegations, inter partes review proceedings and litigation matters;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory developments in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nactions taken by industry stakeholders affecting the market for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour and our commercialization and collaborative partners\u2019 compliance or noncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements and with obligations under our collaborative agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop and execute our sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nour plans to acquire, in-license or co-promote other products or compounds or acquire or combine with other companies, and our degree of success in realizing the intended advantages of, and mitigating any risks associated with, any such transaction;\n\u2022\nadverse events related to our products, or product candidates, including recalls;\n\u2022\ninterruptions of manufacturing or supply, or other manufacture or supply difficulties;\n\u2022\nvariations in revenues obtained from commercialization and collaborative agreements, including contingent milestone payments, royalties, license fees and other contract revenues, including nonrecurring revenues, and the accounting treatment with respect thereto;\n\u2022\nadverse events or circumstances related to our peer companies or our industry or the markets for our products;\n\u2022\nadoption of new technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndecisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of a collaboration or program;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate additional revenues from our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock or the dilutive effect of our Convertible Notes; and\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results are measured, presented and compare to our financial and operating projections and analyst expectations.\nAs a result of these and other such factors, our stock price may continue to be volatile and investors may be unable to sell their shares at a price equal to, or above, the price paid. Any significant drops in our stock price could give rise to shareholder lawsuits, which are costly and time-consuming to defend against and which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital while the suits are pending, even if the suits are ultimately resolved in our favor.\nIn addition, if the market for pharmaceutical stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. For example, if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our stock or publishes an inaccurate research report about our company, the market price for our common stock would likely decline. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future.\nTo date, we have recorded revenues from product sales, license fees, royalties, collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies. In 2019, 2017 and 2016 we incurred net losses of $217.2 million, $102.5 million and $88.7 million, respectively. We may continue to incur operating losses in future years. Any such losses may have an adverse impact on our total assets, shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe have significant amounts of long-lived assets which depend upon future positive cash flows to support the values recorded in our balance sheet. We are subject to increased risk of future impairment charges should actual financial results differ materially from our projections.\nOur consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets representing the product rights which we have acquired over the last few years and property and equipment. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. Conditions that could indicate impairment of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in market conditions, significant competing product launches by our competitors, significant adverse change in the manner in which the long-lived asset is being used and adverse legal or regulatory outcomes.\nIn performing our impairment tests, which assess the recoverability of our assets, we utilize our future projections of cash flows. Projections of future cash flows are inherently subjective and reflect assumptions that may or may not ultimately be realized. Significant assumptions utilized in our projections include, but are not limited to, our evaluation of the market opportunity for our products, the current and future competitive landscape and resulting impacts to product pricing, future regulatory actions, planned strategic initiatives and the realization of benefits associated with our existing patents. Given the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in projections, we could experience significant unfavorable variances in future periods or revise our projections downward. This would result in an increased risk that our long-lived assets may be impaired. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $189.8 million related to the NUCYNTA intangible, which represented the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value as of December 31, 2019. The Company determined that the fair value was $375.0 million as of December 31, 2019, which was lower than the carrying value of $564.8 million. This impairment loss is described in more detail in \u201cItem 8, Note 6. Intangible Assets\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This impairment and any future impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer concentration can materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our commercialization partners sell a significant amount of our products to a limited number of independent wholesale drug distributors. If we, or our commercialization partners, were to lose the business of one or more of these distributors, if any of these distributors failed to fulfill their obligations, if any of these distributors experienced difficulty in\npaying us or our commercialization partners on a timely basis, or if any of these distributors negotiated lower pricing terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur product revenues have typically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year.\nOur product revenues have typically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. We believe this arises primarily as a result of wholesalers\u2019 reductions of inventory of our products in the first quarter and annual changes in health insurance plans that occur at the beginning of the calendar year.\nOur wholesalers typically end the calendar year with higher levels of inventory of our products than at the end of the first quarter of the following year. As a result, in such first quarters, net sales are typically lower than would otherwise have been the case as a result of the reduction of product inventory at our wholesalers. Any material reduction by our wholesalers of their inventory of our products in the first quarter of any calendar year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding calendar year can adversely affect our operating results and can cause our stock price to decline.\nMany health insurance plans and government programs reset annual limits on deductibles and out-of-pocket costs at the beginning of each calendar year and require participants to pay for substantially all of the costs of medical services and prescription drug products until such deductibles and annual out-of-pocket cost limits are met. In addition, enrollment in high-deductible health insurance plans has increased significantly in recent years. As a result of these factors, patients may delay filling or refilling prescriptions for our products or substitute less expensive generic products until such deductibles and annual out-of-pocket cost limits are met. Any reduction in the demand for our products, including those marketed by our commercialization partners as a result of the foregoing factors or otherwise, can adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in fair value of contingent consideration assumed as part of our acquisitions can adversely affect our results of operations.\nContingent consideration obligations arise from the Zipsor and CAMBIA acquisitions and relate to the potential future contingent milestone payments and royalties payable under the respective agreements. The contingent consideration is initially recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The estimates of fair values for the contingent consideration contain uncertainties as it involves assumptions about the probability assigned to the potential milestones and royalties being achieved and the discount rate. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, can have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20). Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital within shareholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we have been required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income (or larger net losses) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the accretion of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which adversely affects our reported or future financial results and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if the Convertible Notes become convertible, we are required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than a long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Finally, we use the if-converted method to compute\ndiluted earnings per share with respect to our convertible debt, which could be more dilutive than assuming the debt would be settled in cash.\nAny of these factors could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls, our stock price could suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, we must perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, include in our annual report the results of the evaluation and have our external auditors also publicly attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur ability to produce accurate financial statements and comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations is largely dependent on our maintenance of internal control and reporting systems, as well as on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and accounting personnel to further develop our internal accounting function and control policies. If we fail to effectively establish and maintain such reporting and accounting systems or fail to attract and retain personnel who are capable of designing and operating such systems, these failures will increase the likelihood that we may be required to restate our financial results to correct errors or that we will become subject to legal and regulatory infractions, which may entail civil litigation and investigations by regulatory agencies including the SEC. In addition, if material weaknesses are found in our internal controls in the future, if we fail to complete future evaluations on time or if our external auditors cannot attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could fail to meet our regulatory reporting requirements and be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price or expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings, which may be costly or divert management attention.\nOur financial results are impacted by management\u2019s assumptions and use of estimates.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities as well as subsequent fair value measurements. Additionally, estimates are used in determining items such as sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, share-based compensation assumptions, fair value of contingent consideration and taxes on income. Although management believes these estimates are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of our business and operations, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nRisks Related to Share Ownership and Other Stockholder Matters\nWe are subject to risks from future proxy fight or the actions of activist shareholders.\nOn October 17, 2016, we and Starboard Value LP (Starboard) entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which, among other things, (i) three independent directors appointed by Starboard joined our Board of Directors, (ii) we amended our bylaws to move the window for shareholders director nominations and other shareholder proposals for consideration at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders to March 15, 2017 through April 15, 2017 and (iii) Starboard agreed to withdraw its request for the Special Meeting scheduled to be held on November 15, 2016. On March 28, 2017, we and Starboard entered into a cooperation and support agreement pursuant to which, among other things, two additional independent directors appointed by Starboard joined our Board of Directors and the parties agreed to certain standstill commitments.\nAnother proxy contest or related activities with Starboard or other activist shareholders could adversely affect our business for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, customers and others important to our success, any of which could negatively affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition; and\n\u2022\nif nominees advanced by activist shareholders are elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans or to realize\nlong-term value from our assets, and this could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nProxy contests have in the past and may in the future cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. Further, if a proxy contest results in a change in control of our Board of Directors, such an event would subject us to risks relating to certain third parties\u2019 rights under our existing contractual obligations, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to risks related to unsolicited takeover attempts in the future.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to unsolicited attempts to gain control of our company. Responding to any such attempt would distract management attention away from our business and would require us to incur significant costs. Moreover, any unsolicited takeover attempt may disrupt our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees, producers, suppliers, customers and other constituencies important to our success, which could negatively impact our financial results and business initiatives. Other disruptions to our business include potential volatility in our stock price and potential adverse impacts on the timing of, and our ability to consummate, acquisitions of products and companies.\nCertain provisions applicable to the Convertible Notes can delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt.\nCertain provisions applicable to the Convertible Notes and the indentures governing the Convertible Notes make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change under the indentures for the Convertible Notes, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. In addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d under the indentures, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. In any of these cases, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the indentures, as well as provisions of our organizational documents and other agreements, can increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns on shares of our common stock will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market if we are unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing standards.\nNasdaq imposes, among other requirements, continued listing standards including minimum bid requirement. The price of our common stock must trade at or above $1.00 to comply with the minimum bid requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Recently, our common stock has traded at closing bid prices just above and below $1.00. If the closing bid price of our common stock fails to meet Nasdaq\u2019s minimum closing bid price requirement for a period in excess of 30 consecutive days, or if we otherwise fail to meet any other applicable requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and we are unable to regain compliance, Nasdaq may make a determination to delist our common stock. Any delisting of our common stock would likely adversely affect the market liquidity and market price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and/or result in the loss of confidence by investors. Furthermore, the delisting of our common stock would give the holders of the Convertible Notes rights to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at the prices set forth in the indentures governing the Convertible Notes. If this were to happen, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 85686, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ASRT"}
