{"cik": "351817", "company": "SWIFT ENERGY CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Bankruptcy:\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company along with eight of its subsidiaries, including Swift Energy International, Inc., Swift Energy Group, Inc., Swift Energy USA, Inc., Swift Energy Alaska, Inc., Swift Energy Operating, LLC, GASRS LLC, SWENCO-Western, LLC and Swift Energy Exploration Services, Inc., filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings do not include our international subsidiaries, which are 100% owned by our domestic subsidiary Swift Energy International, Inc.\nOur operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan, our financial condition, our liquidity and our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our bankruptcy. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 proceedings\u037e\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan in the current depressed commodity price environment\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to convert the Chapter 11 proceedings to a Chapter 7 proceeding\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nDelays in our Chapter 11 proceedings increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We also need Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events that occur during our Chapter 11 proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a reorganization plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan. Although the Bankruptcy Court has approved a disclosure statement with respect to the Plan and solicitation of the Plan has commenced, solicitation is not complete and other requirements and statutory conditions necessary for confirmation of the Plan have not yet been satisfied. While a confirmation hearing on the Plan has been scheduled on March 30, 2016, it is possible that hearing could be delayed. It is also possible that the Bankruptcy Court will not confirm the Plan.\nCreditors may not vote in favor of our Plan, and certain parties in interest may file objections to the Plan in an effort to persuade the Bankruptcy Court that we have not satisfied the confirmation requirements under section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. Even if no objections are filed and the requisite acceptances of our Plan are received from creditors entitled to vote on the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court, which can exercise substantial discretion, may not confirm the Plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends\nupon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, preferred or common stock).\nIf the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nEven if a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including further deterioration in commodity prices or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our oil and gas and increasing expenses. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the Plan or any other Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of our Chapter 11 proceedings. Our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, if they are available at all.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital. As a result, we cannot give any assurance of our ability to continue as a going concern, even if the Plan is confirmed.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may not be able to obtain sufficient liquidity to confirm a plan of reorganization and exit bankruptcy.\nAlthough we have lowered our capital budget and reduced the scale of our operations significantly, our business remains capital intensive. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 proceedings. While we entered into a Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) Credit Agreement in connection with the Chapter 11 filings, which provides for a multi-draw term loan in an aggregate amount of up to $75.0 million, as of the date hereof, we have not received a commitment for any additional interim financing or exit financing. Furthermore, our ability to access $45.0 million of the funds available under the DIP Credit Agreement is contingent on our ability to successfully amend and restate or refinance our current $330.0 million revolving credit facility and secure exit financing. Even if we are able to amend and restate or refinance our current revolving credit facility, we do not anticipate any additional liquidity we receive from such an amendment and restatement or refinancing to be substantial.\nWe do not believe that our borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement, our cash on hand and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations for any significant period of time. There are no assurances that our current liquidity is sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 proceedings, allow us to proceed with the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and allow us to emerge from bankruptcy. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure additional interim financing or exit financing sufficient to meet our liquidity needs or, if sufficient funds are available, offered to us on acceptable terms.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in our Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe believe it is highly likely that the shares of our existing common stock will be canceled in our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nThe Plan provides, among other things, that upon our emergence from bankruptcy, our existing common stock will be canceled and the holders of our existing common stock will receive four percent of the our post-emergence common stock plus warrants. If the Plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the existing shareholders\u2019 post-emergence shares of common stock and warrants may be subject to further dilution due to subsequent capital raising activities. Additionally, the Plan may not be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, in which case, the chance that the existing shareholders will receive little or no distribution in our Chapter 11 proceedings would increase. Accordingly, any trading in shares of our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in our Chapter 11 proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 proceedings, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing.\nIn addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.\nTransfers of our equity, or issuances of equity in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation, depletion and amortization deductions in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $822 million as of December 31, 2015. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and amortizable tax basis in our properties may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more stockholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation a plan of reorganization, it is possible that an \u201cownership change\u201d may be deemed to occur. Under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, absent an applicable exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation. Further, future deductions for depreciation, depletion and amortization could be limited if the fair value of our assets is determined to be less than the tax basis.\nRisks Related to the Business:\nCommodity prices have dropped substantially and rapidly since September 2014. Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile. Continued low prices or their further downward movement could threaten our ability to emerge from bankruptcy and implement our business plan.\nOur future revenues, net income, cash flow, and the value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Our borrowing capacity and ability to obtain additional capital is also\ndependent on oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices have dropped precipitously over the past year and have fallen to their lowest level in 13 years.\nContinued low price levels or further decreases in price levels for oil and natural gas could negatively affect us in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain funds to operate our business and implement our business plan;\n\u2022\nour cash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital, operating and administrative expenditures;\n\u2022\na substantial number of reserves would no longer be economic to produce, leading to both lower cash flow and lower proved reserves; and\n\u2022\nrequire further future write-downs of our oil and gas properties.\nInsufficient capital could lead to declines in our cash flow or in our oil and natural gas reserves, or a loss of properties.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. Although our 2015 total capital expenditures, including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions, drilling and infrastructure, were approximately $104 million, our 2016 capital expenditure budget has been reduced to $78.0 million. Cash flow from operations is a principal source of our financing of our future capital expenditures. Insufficient cash flow from operations and inability to access capital could lead to losing leases that require us to drill new wells in order to maintain the lease. Lower liquidity and other capital constraints may make it difficult to drill those wells prior to the lease expiration dates, which could result in our losing reserves and production.\nIf low commodity prices continue for an extended period, our liquidity would be significantly reduced.\nWhile we anticipate substantially all of our $906 million of long-term unsecured indebtedness will be discharged upon confirmation of our Plan, we will continue to have substantial capital needs upon emergence from bankruptcy, including in connection with our existing secured indebtedness and the continued development of our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital in the future to fund our operations and implement our business plan. An extended period of low commodity prices would substantially reduce our cash flows and would likely reduce liquidity to a level that would make it increasingly difficult to operate our business.\nWe have written down the carrying values on our oil and gas properties in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and expect to incur additional write-downs in the future.\nThe SEC accounting rules require that on a quarterly basis we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible write-down or impairment (the \"ceiling test\"). Any capital costs in excess of the ceiling amount must be permanently written down. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reported non-cash write-downs on a before-tax basis of, $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after-tax), $445.4 million ($287.3 million after-tax) and $46.9 million ($30.0 million after-tax) respectively, on our oil and gas properties. If oil and natural gas prices remain at their current low levels or decline further from the prices used in calculating the fourth quarter of 2015 ceiling test, we anticipate that we will be required to record additional non-cash write-downs of oil and gas properties in the first quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the ceiling test calculation.\nEstimates of proved reserves are uncertain, and revenues from production may vary significantly from expectations.\nThe quantities and values of our proved reserves included in our 2015 estimates of proved reserves are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates and could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves.\nFederal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing using fluids other than diesel is currently exempt from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, but opponents of hydraulic fracturing have called for further study of the technique's environmental effects and, in some\ncases, a moratorium on the use of the technique. Various committees of Congress have been investigating hydraulic fracturing practices and several proposals have been submitted to Congress that, if implemented, would subject all hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states have adopted or are otherwise considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, including restrictions on its use in environmentally sensitive areas. Some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities, or are considering doing so.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict the requirements of any additional federal or state legislation or regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal or state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay or halt our ability to develop oil and gas reserves.\nOur ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nDrilling activities require the use of fresh water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient aquifer capacity to provide a local source of water for drilling activities, and water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas.\nMoreover, compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur Southeast Louisiana core area can be affected by hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in pipeline outages or damage to production facilities, causing production delays and/or significant repair costs.\nApproximately 5% of our 2015 reserves, 9% of our 2015 production and 18% of our 2015 revenues were located in our Southeast Louisiana core area. Increased hurricane activity over the past ten years has resulted in production curtailments and physical damage to our Gulf Coast operations. For example, a significant percentage of our production was shut down by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, and by Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Since we do not carry business interruption insurance (loss of production), if hurricanes damage the Gulf Coast region where we have a significant percentage of our operations, our cash flow would suffer. This decrease in cash flow, depending on the extent of the decrease, could reduce the funds we would have available for capital expenditures and reduce our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.\nA worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot control or predict.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect the financial viability of and increase the credit risk associated with our purchasers, suppliers, insurers, and commodity derivative counterparties to perform under the terms of contracts or financial arrangements we have with them. Although we have heightened our level of scrutiny of our contractual counterparties, our assessment of the risk of non-performance by various parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets. This same crisis may adversely impact insurers and their ability to pay current and future insurance claims that we may have.\nOur future access to capital could be limited due to tightening credit markets that could affect our ability to fund our future capital projects. In addition, long-term restriction upon or freezing of the capital markets and legislation related to financial and banking reform may affect short-term or long-term liquidity.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves high risks and we may suffer uninsured losses.\nThese risks include blowouts, explosions, adverse weather effects and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and gas industry, it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, such as business interruption, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining and carrying such insurance.\nDrilling wells is speculative and capital intensive.\nDeveloping and exploring properties for oil and natural gas requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling or completion of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nhurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas, or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contaminates\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions; and\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial condition.\nGovernmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection are costly and stringent.\nOur exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including the protection of endangered species. These laws, regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. In addition, some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators. Changes in, or additions to, environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or other environmental protection requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nEnactment of executive, legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.\nNumerous executive, legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by the President, Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) climate change/carbon tax legislation introduced in Congress, and EPA regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (2) Presidential proposals, along with legislation introduced in Congress (none of which have passed), to impose new fees or taxes on, or repeal various tax deductions available to, oil and gas producers, such as the current tax deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses, which deductions, if eliminated, could raise the cost of energy production, reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities; (3) legislation previously considered by Congress (but not adopted) that would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and new, proposed or anticipated Department of Interior and EPA regulations to impose new and more stringent regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, particularly those performed on federal lands, and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process; and (4) the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act enacted in 2011, which increases penalties, grants new\nauthority to impose damage prevention and incident notification requirements, and directs the PHMSA to prescribe minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines.\nAny of the foregoing described proposals, including other applicable proposals, could affect our operations and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.\nIn recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits and deductions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the increase of the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses, (iii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses; and (iv) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities. It is currently unclear whether any such proposals will be enacted or what form they might possibly take or impact they may have; however, the passage of such legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate, reduce or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal proceedings could result in liability affecting our results of operations.\nMost oil and gas companies, such as us, are involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters.\nBecause we maintain a portfolio of assets in the various areas in which we operate, the complexity and types of legal proceedings with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations, damage to our properties and/or injuries. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.\nTo date we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.", "PERMNO": 66739, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SBOW"}
