{"cik": "1145197", "company": "INSULET CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nAlthough we achieved profitability in 2018, we previously incurred significant losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will sustain profitability.\nPrior to 2018 and since our inception in 2000, we incurred significant losses. Our losses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $26.8 million, $27.2 million and $61.6 million, respectively. The extent of any future losses and the timing of profitability are uncertain, and we may not sustain profitability. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $672.0 million.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.\nThe fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations have resulted, and may continue to result, from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in shipping due to capacity constraints;\n\u2022\npractices of health insurance companies and other third-party payors with respect to reimbursement for our current or future products;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture our products efficiently, or at all;\n\u2022\ntransitions in our distribution channel;\n\u2022\ntiming of regulatory approvals and clearances;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions;\n\u2022\ncompetition; and\n\u2022\ntiming of research and development expenditures.\nThese factors, some of which are not within our control, may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. If our quarterly results of operations fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. We believe the quarterly comparisons of our financial results should not be the only indication of our future performance.\nWe currently rely on sales of the Omnipod System, and tailored versions of the Omnipod System in our drug delivery product line, to generate nearly all our revenue. The failure of the Omnipod System to achieve and maintain significant market acceptance or any factors that negatively impact sales of this product will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur main product is the Omnipod System, which we introduced to the market in 2005. We expect to continue to derive nearly all our revenue from the sale of this product. Accordingly, our ability to continue to generate revenue is highly reliant on our ability to market and sell the Omnipod System and to retain consumers who currently use the product. Our sales of the Omnipod System may be negatively impacted by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure of the Omnipod System to achieve and maintain wide acceptance among opinion leaders in the diabetes treatment community, insulin-prescribing physicians, third-party payors and people with insulin-dependent diabetes;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing problems or capacity constraints;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived quality problems;\n\u2022\nreductions in reimbursement rates or coverage policies relating to the Omnipod System by third-party payors;\n\u2022\nclaims that any portion of the Omnipod System infringes on patent rights or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory or legal actions relating to the Omnipod System;\n\u2022\ndamage, destruction or loss of any of the facilities where our products are manufactured or stored or of the equipment therein or failure to successfully open or expand new facilities;\n\u2022\nconversion rate of referrals to actual sales of the Omnipod System;\n\u2022\nthe inability of users to continue paying for our products;\n\u2022\nattrition rates of consumers who cease using the Omnipod System;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing and related factors; and\n\u2022\nresults of clinical studies relating to the Omnipod System or our competitors\u2019 products.\nIf any of these events occurs, our ability to generate revenue could be significantly reduced.\nOur ability to sustain profitability may depend on our ability to sustain or further reduce the per unit cost of producing the Omnipod System by increasing customer orders, increasing manufacturing volume and productivity and reducing raw material and overhead costs per unit.\nTo sustain profitability, we may need to, among other things, sustain or further reduce the per unit cost of the Omnipod System. If we are unable to sustain or further reduce raw material and manufacturing overhead costs through volume purchase discounts, negotiation of improved pricing and increased productivity and production capacity, our ability to sustain profitability could be negatively affected. The occurrence of one or more factors that negatively impact the manufacturing or sales of the Omnipod System or increase our raw material costs could prevent us from sustaining our desired increase in manufacturing volume, which would prevent us from sustaining and further increasing profitability.\nAdverse changes in general economic conditions in the United States and outside of the United States, predominantly in Europe, could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in general economic market conditions. A U.S. or global recession, could negatively impact our current and prospective customers, adversely affect the financial ability of health insurers to pay claims, adversely impact our ability to pay our expenses and ability to obtain financing of our operations, cause delays or other problems with key suppliers and increase the risk of counterparty failures.\nHealthcare spending in the United States, Canada and Europe could be negatively affected in the event of a downturn in economic conditions. For example, U.S. consumers who have lost their jobs or healthcare coverage may no longer be covered by an employer-\nsponsored health insurance plan and consumers reducing their overall spending may eliminate purchases requiring co-payments. Since the sale of the Omnipod System to a new user is generally dependent on the availability of third-party reimbursement and may require the user to make a significant co-payment, an economic downturn could reduce the referrals generated by our sales force and thereby reduce our sales orders. Similarly, existing users could cease purchasing the Omnipod System and return to MDI or other less-costly therapies, which would cause our consumer attrition rate to increase. Any decline in new orders or increase in our consumer attrition rate would reduce our revenue, which in turn would make it more difficult to achieve our per-unit cost-savings goals, which we are attempting to attain in part through increases in our manufacturing volume.\nHealthcare reform laws could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nDuring the past several years, the U.S. healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including limiting access to care, alternative delivery models and changes in the methods used to determine reimbursement scenarios and rates, are ongoing at the federal and state government levels. There are provisions of law that provide for the creation of a new public-private Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute tasked with identifying comparative effectiveness research priorities, including establishing a research project agenda and contracting with entities to conduct the research. Research findings published by this institute are publicly disseminated. It is difficult at this time to determine whether a comparative effectiveness analysis impacting our business will be done, and assuming one is, what impact that analysis will have on the Omnipod System or our future financial results.\nThe ACA and related healthcare reform laws, regulations and initiatives have significantly increased regulation of managed care plans and decreased reimbursement to Medicare managed care. Some of these initiatives purport to, among other things, require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plan\u2019s formulary. Moreover, to alleviate budget shortfalls, states have reduced or frozen payments to Medicaid managed care plans. We cannot accurately predict the complete impact of these healthcare reform initiatives, but they could lead to a decreased demand for our products and other outcomes that could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nSome of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In addition, there have been efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA and to alter the implementation of the ACA and related laws. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017 eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d, effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have an adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of any of our products.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nrevenue generated by sales of our current products and any other future products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with capital expenditures, including adding further manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts globally;\n\u2022\nexpenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products;\n\u2022\ncosts of developing new products or technologies and enhancements to our products;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with any expansion;\n\u2022\ncosts of complying with regulatory requirements, including obtaining and maintaining FDA approval or clearance of our current or future products;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with litigation; and\n\u2022\nthe number and timing of any acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $376.1 million, together with the cash to be generated from expected product sales, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the end of 2020.\nWe may in the future seek additional funds from public and private stock offerings, borrowings under credit lines or other sources.\nWe may need to raise additional debt or equity financing to repay our outstanding Senior Convertible Notes. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential future products or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by current economic conditions, including the effects of any disruptions to the credit and financial markets. As a result of these and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital due to these or other factors, we may need to further manage our operational expenses, including potentially curtailing planned product development activities. In addition, we may not be able to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements. If any of these events occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness represented by our Convertible Senior Notes. We may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or we may experience a financial failure.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding principal amounts due of $1.2 billion on our Convertible Senior Notes, which mature between 2024 and 2026. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance the Convertible Senior Notes or other debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the outstanding Convertible Senior Notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our future debt agreements. In the absence of sufficient cash from operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain sufficient proceeds from those dispositions to meet our debt service and other obligations when due.\nWe are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.\nWe rely on suppliers who manufacture the components for and perform assembly of the Pods and PDMs. In addition, a subsidiary of Flex in China performs assembly and supplies a significant portion of all finished Omnipod Systems. We do not have long-term supply agreements with all our suppliers, and, in many cases, we, or Flex on our behalf, make purchases based on individual purchase orders. In some cases, our agreements with suppliers can be terminated by either party upon short notice. Additionally, our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunction, component part supply constraints and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Our reliance on these third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\nwe are not a major customer of many of our suppliers, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain an adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may make errors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the safety or efficacy of our products, cause delays in shipment or negatively affect our reputation;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our sole-source supplies;\n\u2022\nswitching components may require product redesign and submission to the FDA of a new 510(k);\n\u2022\nour suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for the products these suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver products to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthefts of our trade secrets and intellectual property could occur with the third-party supply process;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of a fire, natural disaster or other catastrophe, impacting one or more of our suppliers, may affect their ability to deliver products to us in a timely manner; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nWe may not be able to quickly establish additional or alternative suppliers, particularly for our sole-source suppliers, in part because of the FDA approval process and because of the custom nature of various parts we require. Any interruption or delay in obtaining products from our third-party suppliers, or our inability to obtain products from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competing products.\nIf we are required to pay sales tax on sales of certain products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that sales of most diabetes supplies are exempt from sales tax in most U.S. jurisdictions. However, if it is subsequently determined that sales of one or more of our products are subject to sales tax in such jurisdictions, our obligation to pay such sales taxes could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nOur financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks.\nWe sell the Omnipod System in Europe, Canada and the Middle East. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-U.S. laws, regulations and customs. Sales outside the United States made up 34% of our revenues in 2019 and we expect non-U.S. sales to contribute significantly to our future growth. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries where we sell our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, may have a significant effect on our operating results. We also rely on third-party suppliers located outside the United States. For example, a significant portion of our Omnipod Systems are manufactured at a facility in China operated by Flex.\nOur efforts to introduce or expand our current or future products in foreign markets may not be successful, in which case we may have expended significant resources without realizing the expected benefit. Ultimately, the investment required for expansion into foreign markets could exceed the results of operations generated from this expansion.\nIn addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in the risk factors included in this Item 1A, other risks associated with doing business internationally, include:\n\u2022\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022\neconomic instability and inflation or recession;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, such as tariff increases, and import and export licensing and control requirements;\n\u2022\nnegative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with foreign legal systems, including increased costs associated with enforcing contractual obligations in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nminimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure to fulfill foreign regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all in order to market the Omnipod System or other future products;\n\u2022\navailability of, and changes in, reimbursement within prevailing foreign health care payment systems;\n\u2022\nadapting to the differing laws and regulations, business and clinical practices, and consumer preferences in foreign markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing foreign relationships and operations, including any relationships that we establish with foreign partners, distributors or sales or marketing agents; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods.\nIn addition, expansion into foreign markets imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel, research and sales departments and general management resources. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our production capacity and, consequently, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and we could be materially and adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe long-term impacts on our business of the United Kingdom\u2019s recent withdrawal from the European Union are unknown.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. left the European Union. This withdrawal, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d could potentially disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the European Union or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Because this is an unprecedented event, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union will have and how such withdrawal could affect our business and applicable regulations in the U.K. and Europe. In addition, Brexit may lead other European Union member countries to consider referendums regarding their European Union membership. Any of these events, along with any political, economic and regulatory changes that may occur, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe and internationally and harm our business and financial results.\nFailure to secure or retain adequate coverage or reimbursement for our products by third-party payors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that sales of the Omnipod System will be limited unless a substantial portion of the sales price of the Omnipod System is paid for by third-party payors, including private insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, federal and state government healthcare agencies and other managed care providers. We currently have contracts establishing reimbursement for the Omnipod System with national and regional third-party payors that provide reimbursement in all 50 states. While we anticipate entering into additional contracts with other third-party payors, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so. In addition, these contracts can generally be terminated by the third-party payor without cause. Healthcare market initiatives in the United States may also lead third-party payors to decline or reduce reimbursement for the Omnipod System. Moreover, compliance with administrative procedures or requirements of third-party payors may result in delays in processing approvals by those payors for consumers to obtain coverage for the use of the Omnipod System. Coverage decisions and rates of reimbursement increasingly require clinical evidence showing an improvement in user outcomes. Generating this clinical evidence requires substantial time and investment and there is no guarantee of a desired outcome.\nWe are an approved Medicare supplier and, in 2018, CMS issued guidance clarifying that Medicare Part D Plan Sponsors may provide coverage for products such as the Omnipod System under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. As a result, we must negotiate with third-party payors in order to provide our product through the pharmacy channel in the United States to users who are covered under Medicare Part D. Compliance with administrative procedures or requirements of these third-party payors may result in delays in processing approvals by those payors for consumers to obtain Medicare Part D coverage for the use of the Omnipod System. Medicaid coverage decisions are made by the governing authorities in each state. As the Medicaid coverage process and stakeholders are unique to each state, the timeline to gain coverage in each state may vary.\nWe expect to sell Omnipod DASH primarily through the pharmacy channel in the United States, which may require new or amended agreements with our intermediaries and payors. The availability of Omnipod DASH may be limited or restricted if we are unable to secure the same level of reimbursement that we currently have for the Omnipod.\nAs we expand our sales and marketing efforts outside of the United States, we face additional risks associated with obtaining and maintaining reimbursement from foreign health care payment systems on a timely basis or at all.\nFailure to secure or retain adequate coverage or reimbursement for the Omnipod System by third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition from numerous competitors, many of whom have far greater resources than we have, which may make it more difficult for us to achieve significant market penetration and which may allow them to develop additional products for the treatment of diabetes that compete with the Omnipod System.\nThe medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. The Omnipod System competes with several existing insulin delivery devices as well as other methods for the treatment of diabetes. Medtronic has been the market leader for many years and has the majority share of the conventional insulin pump market in the United States. Other suppliers we compete with include Tandem in the United States and Roche and Ypsomed outside the United States.\nMany of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with more market share and resources than we have. As a result, they can spend more aggressively on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. Many of these competitors have:\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022\ndifferent and more complete reimbursement profiles;\n\u2022\nestablished relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nlarger and more established distribution networks;\n\u2022\ngreater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory approval; and\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation.\nWe also compete with MDI therapy, which is substantially less expensive than pump therapy. MDI therapy involves a user injecting themselves with both long-acting and short-acting insulin with a syringe or insulin pen. While we believe that pump therapy, in general, and the Omnipod System, in particular, have significant competitive and clinical advantages over traditional MDI therapy, improvements in the effectiveness of MDI therapy may result in fewer people with insulin-dependent diabetes converting from MDI therapy to pump therapy than we expect and may result in negative price pressure.\nIn addition to the established insulin pump competitors, several companies are working to develop and market new insulin \u201cpatch\u201d pumps and other methods for the treatment of diabetes. These companies are at various stages of development and the number of such companies continuously changes as they enter or exit the market on an ongoing basis.\nOur current competitors or other companies may at any time develop additional products for the treatment of diabetes. If an existing or future competitor develops a product that competes with or is superior to the Omnipod System, our revenue may decline. In addition, some of our competitors may compete by changing their pricing model or by lowering the price of their insulin delivery systems or ancillary supplies. If these competitors\u2019 products were to gain acceptance by healthcare professionals, people with insulin-dependent diabetes or third-party payors, a downward pressure on prices could result. If prices were to fall, our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of our product and information technology systems and a cyber-attack or other breach or disruption of our product or these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The form and function of such systems may change over time as our business needs change. The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal and financial information regarding our customers. We use our information technology systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, shipping, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing and accounts payable. In addition, we use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize transactions and other financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal, and tax regulatory requirements. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions, disruptions or shutdowns, could result in the unauthorized access to customer data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or the loss of key data and information, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Additionally, the FDA has warned that insulin pumps may have cybersecurity vulnerabilities and could be manipulated by hackers, causing danger to diabetes patients. If our product is breached or our information technology systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of our customer, third-party payor, employee, supplier or Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation, enforcement actions and reputational damage.\nOur business, like that of most medical device manufacturers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customer information and payment and reimbursement information, as well as confidential information about third-party payors, our employees, our suppliers and our Company. Our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information, device security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and our efforts may not be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, misuse of data or sabotage of our systems. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, third-party payor, employee, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nTechnological breakthroughs in diabetes monitoring, treatment or prevention could render the Omnipod System obsolete.\nThe diabetes treatment market is subject to rapid technological change and product innovation. The Omnipod System is based on our proprietary technology, but a number of companies, medical researchers and pharmaceutical companies are pursuing new delivery devices, delivery technologies, sensing technologies, procedures, drugs and other therapeutics for the monitoring, treatment and/or prevention of insulin-dependent diabetes. For example, FDA approval of a commercially viable \u201cclosed-loop\u201d or \u201chybrid closed-loop\u201d system that combines continuous \u201creal-time\u201d glucose sensing or monitoring and automatic continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in a manner that delivers appropriate amounts of insulin on a timely basis with reduced user direction could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and future profitability. Medtronic commercially launched a \u201chybrid closed-loop\u201d system in 2017, and in January 2020 Tandem announced the commercial launch of an automated insulin delivery system, which could negatively impact our business. In addition, the National Institutes of Health and other supporters of diabetes research are continually seeking ways to prevent, cure or improve the treatment of diabetes. Any technological breakthroughs in diabetes monitoring, treatment or prevention could render the Omnipod System obsolete, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur own new product development initiatives may prove to be ineffective or not commercially successful.\nWe have ongoing initiatives to develop products to improve the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We may be unable to effectively introduce and market new products or may fail to keep pace with advances in technology. The healthcare industry is characterized by continuous technological change, resulting in changing consumer preferences and requirements. The success of our business depends on our ability to introduce new products and adapt to these changing technologies and consumer demands. To compete in the marketplace, we must make substantial investments in new product development whether internally or externally through licensing or acquisitions. Even if we can develop, manufacture and obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals for our new products, the success of those products depends on market acceptance. Market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative products from our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe price of our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our market entry; and\n\u2022\nour ability to market and distribute our products effectively.\nOur failure to introduce new and innovative products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf our existing license agreement with Abbott, which allows us to incorporate a blood glucose meter into the Omnipod, is terminated or if Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle meter is less desirable to current and potential users, our business may be materially adversely impacted.\nOur rights to incorporate the FreeStyle blood glucose meter into the Omnipod are governed by a development and license agreement with Abbott. This agreement provides us with a non-exclusive, fully paid, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license under\npatents and other relevant technical information relating to the FreeStyle blood glucose meter through January 2023. The agreement may be terminated prior to 2023 in the event of certain breaches by either party. Breach of the contract by us could lead to damages and result in a loss of the license. Such a loss in the near-term could require us to either remove the blood glucose meter from PDMs sold in the future, which could impair the functionality of the Omnipod, or attempt to incorporate an alternative blood glucose meter into the PDM, either of which would require significant development and regulatory activities that might not be completed in time to prevent an interruption in the availability of the Omnipod to consumers. These could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FreeStyle blood glucose meter in our PDM is only approved for use with FreeStyle test strips in the United States. Not all third-party payors reimburse users for the purchase of FreeStyle test strips to the same extent as they reimburse users for other brands of test strips. The absence or reduction in such reimbursement or availability of the test strips may make the Omnipod less desirable to current and potential users.\nIn the future, we may need additional agreements or licenses to intellectual property or other rights in order to sell our current product or commercialize new products. If we cannot obtain these agreements, licenses, or other rights, we may not be able to sell, develop or commercialize these products. Our rights to use technologies licensed to us by third parties are not entirely within our control, and we may not be able to continue selling the Omnipod or sell future products without these rights.\nOur non-insulin drug delivery product line faces challenges which, if not met, may impair its future success.\nOur non-insulin drug delivery product line involves the development, manufacture and sale of a modified Omnipod System for delivery of a specific drug other than insulin. Most of our commercialized drug delivery revenue consists of sales of a customized version of our product for use in Amgen\u2019s Neulasta Onpro kit. The marketing and sales initiatives driving this product line differ markedly from those on which we rely for our sales of Omnipod Systems to treat diabetes since the non-insulin drug delivery devices depend on marketing and sales to pharmaceutical companies, not to users and clinicians. We expect that the future results of our non-insulin drug delivery product line will face several challenges, including:\n\u2022\nour identification of drug delivery opportunities for a modified Omnipod System;\n\u2022\nour achievement of satisfactory development and pricing terms with the pharmaceutical companies that sell such drugs;\n\u2022\nour development of appropriate modifications to our Omnipod System technology to address the needs and parameters required for the respective drug-delivery opportunities;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing issues relating to the modified Omnipod System;\n\u2022\nlong lead-times associated with the development, regulatory approvals and ramp up applicable to the use of modified Omnipod Systems for the delivery of such drugs;\n\u2022\nrelatively small number of modified Omnipod Systems needed to address each drug-delivery opportunity;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding the market acceptance of such drugs and the modified Omnipod Systems as appropriate delivery devices;\n\u2022\nuncertainties relating to the success of the pharmaceutical companies in marketing and selling such drugs as well as the modified Omnipod Systems as the appropriate delivery devices;\n\u2022\nintense competition in the drug-delivery industry, including from competitors which have substantially greater resources than we do;\n\u2022\ndemand of non-insulin drugs, including the impact of generics and biosimilars;\n\u2022\nmaintaining appropriate gross margins; and\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements and reimbursement rates associated with such drugs.\nIf we are unsuccessful in overcoming one or more of these challenges, or if our agreement with Amgen is terminated, our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe patent rights on which we rely to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate, which could enable third parties to use our technology and would harm our continued ability to compete in the market.\nOur success will depend in part on our continued ability to develop or acquire commercially valuable patent rights and to protect these rights adequately. Our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other related rights include the following:\n\u2022\nthe pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nthe claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nother companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed.\nWe also may not be able to protect our patent rights effectively in some foreign countries, such as China, where we rely on a third-party contract manufacturer to produce our product. Additionally, for a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent protection. Our patent rights underlying our products may not be adequate, and our competitors or users may design around our proprietary technologies or independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to ours without infringing on any of our patent rights. In addition, the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther rights and measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate, which would harm our ability to compete in the market.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. While we currently require employees, consultants and other third parties to sign confidentiality, non-disclosure or assignment of invention agreements, or a combination thereof where appropriate, any of the following could still occur:\n\u2022\nthe agreements may be breached;\n\u2022\nwe may have inadequate remedies for any breach;\n\u2022\ntrade secrets and other proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors; or\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies.\nIf our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would harm our ability to compete in the market.\nWe rely on patents to protect a portion of our intellectual property and our competitive position. The patent laws that relate to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate are still evolving and, consequently, certain patent positions in the medical device industry are generally uncertain. In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022\nassert claims of infringement;\n\u2022\nenforce our patents;\n\u2022\nprotect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022\ndetermine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.\nAny lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not being issued. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims that our current or future products infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others could adversely affect our ability to sell those products and cause us to incur additional costs.\nSubstantial litigation over intellectual property rights exists in the medical device industry, and we have settled infringement suits in the past. We expect that we could be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as our revenue increases, the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products and technology in different industry segments overlaps. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents on which our current or future products or technologies may infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us.\nSuch litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources. In addition, such litigation could cause negative publicity, adversely affect prospective users, cause product shipment delays, limit or prohibit us from manufacturing, marketing or selling our current or future products, require\nus to develop non-infringing technology, make substantial payments to third parties or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our revenue could decrease substantially, and we could be exposed to significant liability. A court could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us or our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our current or future products, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, which could restrict the sales and marketing of our products and could cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state, local and foreign government authorities. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u2022design, development and manufacturing;\n\u2022testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u2022clinical trials;\n\u2022regulatory clearances and approvals including premarket clearance and approval;\n\u2022product safety;\n\u2022advertising and promotion;\n\u2022marketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022conformity assessment procedures;\n\u2022product traceability and record keeping procedures;\n\u2022product complaints, complaint reporting, recalls and field safety corrective actions;\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u2022post-market studies; and\n\u2022product import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nBefore a new medical device, or a significant modification of a medical device, including a new use of or claim for an existing product, can be marketed in the United States, it must first receive either 510(k) clearance or PMA from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In December 2012, we received 501(k) clearance for our Omnipod. We have since obtained clearance for modified versions of this device, including Omnipod DASH, which was recently cleared by the FDA to be used as an integrated insulin pump in an interoperable automated insulin delivery system. We may be required to obtain a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for significant further post-market modifications to the Omnipod System. Obtaining 510(k) clearance or PMA for medical devices can be expensive and lengthy, and entail significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. The FDA\u2019s process for obtaining 510(k) clearance usually takes three to twelve months, but it can last longer. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The process for obtaining PMA is much more costly and uncertain and it generally takes from one to three years, or longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval. Some of our future products may require PMA approval. In addition, the FDA may demand that we obtain a PMA prior to marketing future changes of our existing Omnipod System. Further, we may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or PMAs for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, the Omnipod System in a timely fashion or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances could adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn could harm our revenue and future profitability.\nWe also are subject to numerous post-marketing regulatory requirements, which include quality system regulations related to the manufacture of our devices, labeling regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The last of these regulations requires us to report to the FDA if our devices cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred. If we fail to comply with present or future regulatory requirements that are applicable to us, we may be subject to enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncustomer notification, or orders for repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our current or future products;\n\u2022\nadministrative detention by the FDA of medical devices believed to be adulterated or misbranded;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA of new products, new intended uses or modifications to the Omnipod System;\n\u2022\nrescinding 510(k) clearance or suspending or withdrawing PMAs that have already been granted; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. For example, as part of the 21st Century Cures Act enacted in December 2016 and the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, Congress enacted several reforms that further affect medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. While those changes are still being implemented by the FDA, this serves as an example of the rapidly changing regulatory environment in which we operate. In addition, regulatory requirements may change in the future in a way that adversely affects us. For instance, the FDA is in the process of reviewing the 510(k) approval process and criteria and has announced initiatives to improve the current pre- and post-market regulatory processes and requirements associated with infusion pumps and other home use medical devices. As part of this effort, the FDA is reviewing the adverse event reporting and recall processes for insulin pumps. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.\nThe Omnipod is also sold in Canada and certain countries in Europe and the Middle East. As a result, we are required to comply with additional foreign regulatory requirements. As we expand our sales efforts internationally, we may need to obtain additional foreign approval certifications.\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of our future products, and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nSome of our new or modified products will require FDA clearance of a 510(k) or FDA approval of a PMA. The FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or may not clear or approve these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Even early stage review may result in issues. For example, the FDA has issued guidance intended to explain the procedures and criteria used in assessing whether 510(k) and PMA submissions should be accepted for substantive review. Under the \u201cRefuse to Accept\u201d guidance, the FDA conducts an early review against specific acceptance criteria to inform 510(k) and PMA submitters if the submission is administratively complete, or if not, to identify the missing element(s). Submitters are given the opportunity to provide the FDA with the identified information. If the information is not provided within a defined time, the submission will not be accepted for FDA review. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nIf we, our contract manufacturer or our component suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations, the manufacturing and distribution of our devices could be interrupted, and our product sales and operating results could suffer.\nWe, our contract manufacturer and our component suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which is a complex regulatory framework that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping and servicing of our devices. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic, sometimes unannounced, inspections by the FDA. We cannot assure you that our facilities or our contract manufacturers\u2019 or component suppliers\u2019 facilities would pass\nany future quality system inspection. If our or any of our contract manufacturers or component suppliers\u2019 facilities fails a quality system inspection, the manufacturing or distribution of our devices could be interrupted, and our operations disrupted. Failure to take adequate and timely corrective action in response to an adverse quality system inspection could force a suspension or shutdown of our labeling operations or the manufacturing operations of our contract manufacturers, or a recall of our devices.\nIf we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to QSR requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. Any such adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Adverse events involving our products have been reported to us in the past, and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur in the future. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nOur current or future products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products if we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with relevant regulations pertaining to manufacturing practices, labeling, advertising or promotional activities, or if new information is obtained concerning the safety or efficacy of these products. For example, under the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall. A government-mandated recall could occur if the FDA finds that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. A voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of any material deficiency in a device, such as manufacturing defects, labeling deficiencies, packaging defects or other failures to comply with applicable regulations. In general, if we decide to make a change to our product, we are responsible for determining whether to classify the change as a recall. It is possible that the FDA could disagree with our initial classification. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. If a change to a device addresses a violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that change would generally constitute a medical device recall and require submission of a recall report to the FDA.\nRecalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval or commercialize our products.\nWe rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties to conduct some of our clinical trials and pre-clinical investigations. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, or at all, and our business and operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nWe may be subject to enforcement action if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our products.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. Doctors may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a doctor\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products could be impaired. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, and harm our reputation.\nIf we were found to be noncompliant with state DME licensure rules, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products directly to consumers in that state.\nSeveral states require that DME providers be licensed in order to sell products to customers in that state. Certain of these states require, among other things, that DME providers maintain an in-state location. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products directly to consumers in that state.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws prohibiting \u201ckickbacks\u201d and false or fraudulent claims, and other fraud and abuse laws, transparency laws, and other health care laws and regulations, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs and certain customer and product support programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians, customers or other potential purchasers of medical devices. These laws include, among others, the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil False Claims Act, other federal health care false statement and fraud statutes, the Open Payments program, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, and analogous fraud and abuse and transparency laws in most states, as described in \u201cItem 1 - Business-Government Regulation\u201d.\nWe conduct various marketing and product training activities that involve making payments to healthcare providers and entities. While we believe and make every effort to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties and other activities and programs comply with all applicable laws, these laws are complex and our activities may be found not to be compliant with one of these laws, which may result in significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, fines, damages, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our compliance with Medicare and Medicaid regulations may be reviewed by federal or state agencies, including the OIG, CMS, and the Department of Justice, or may be subject to whistleblower lawsuits under federal and state false claims laws. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, government agencies conduct periodic audits of us to ensure compliance with various supplier standards and billing requirements.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain health information and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated privacy rules under HIPAA. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, corrupt practices, fraud, waste and abuse restrictions, and securities law compliance. The introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations. For example, data protection laws passed by the federal government, many states and foreign countries require notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data. In the state of California, the CCPA, which provides certain privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of the state became effective January 2020. These consumer rights include the right to know what personal information is collected, the right to know whether the data is sold or disclosed and to whom, the right to request a company to the delete personal information collected, the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information and the right to non-discrimination in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be subject to civil sanctions, including fines and penalties for noncompliance.\nIn addition, foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. Data localization laws in some countries generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country. We could be subject to audits in Europe and around the world, particularly in the areas of consumer and data protection, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products less useful to users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways. For example, the GDPR imposes requirements in the European Economic Area relating to, among other things, consent to process personal data of individuals, the information provided to individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, the security and confidentiality of personal data, notifications in the event of data breaches and use of third party processors. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and penalties and amounts could be significant.\nProduct liability suits and other litigation, whether or not meritorious, could be brought against us. These suits could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages, and an increase in our insurance rates.\nIf our current or future products are defectively designed or manufactured, contain defective components or are misused, or if someone claims any of the foregoing, whether or not meritorious, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation. Misusing our devices or failing to adhere to the operating guidelines of the Omnipod System or other products based on the Omnipod System technology could cause significant harm to users, including death. In addition, if our operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may be subject to liability. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. While we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and could reduce revenue. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nOur ability to grow our revenue depends in part on our retaining a high percentage of our customers.\nA key to driving our revenue growth is the retention of a high percentage of our customers. We have developed retention programs aimed at both healthcare professionals and consumers, which include appeals assistance, ongoing customer communications, newsletters, support, training and an automatic re-order program for certain customers. We have had a satisfactory customer retention rate; however, we cannot assure you that we will maintain this retention rate in the future. Current uncertainty in global economic conditions, competition, higher levels of unemployment, changes in insurance reimbursement levels and negative financial news may negatively affect product demand. If demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our ability to attract and retain customers could be harmed. The failure to retain a high percentage of our customers could negatively impact our revenue growth and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have sponsored, and expect to continue to sponsor, market studies seeking to demonstrate certain aspects of the efficacy of the Omnipod System, which may fail to produce favorable results.\nTo help improve, market and sell the Omnipod System, we have sponsored, and expect to continue to sponsor market studies to assess various aspects of the Omnipod System\u2019s functionality and its relative efficacy. The data obtained from the studies may be\nunfavorable to the Omnipod System or may be inadequate to support satisfactory conclusions. In addition, in the future we may sponsor clinical trials to assess certain aspects of the efficacy of the Omnipod System. If future clinical trials fail to support the efficacy of our current or future products, our sales may be adversely affected and we may lose an opportunity to secure clinical preference from prescribing clinicians, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf future clinical studies or other articles are published, or diabetes associations or other organizations announce positions that are unfavorable to the Omnipod System, our sales efforts and revenue may be negatively affected.\nFuture clinical studies or other articles regarding our existing products or any competing products may be published that either support a claim, or are perceived to support a claim, that a competitor\u2019s product is clinically more effective or easier to use than the Omnipod System or that the Omnipod System is not as effective or easy to use as we claim. Additionally, diabetes associations, healthcare providers that focus on diabetes or other organizations that may be viewed as authoritative could endorse products or methods that compete with the Omnipod System or otherwise announce positions that are unfavorable to the Omnipod System. Any of these events may negatively affect our sales efforts and result in decreased revenue.\nOur Omnipod System inventory is produced and maintained in a limited number of locations.\nOur manufacturing of the Omnipod System is conducted in two locations, at our U.S. manufacturing facility in Massachusetts and on manufacturing lines owned by us at a facility located in China, operated by a subsidiary of Flex. Political or financial instability, currency fluctuations, the outbreak of pandemics such as the Coronavirus, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of product from China, increase our costs, and/or adversely affect our results of operation. In addition, substantially all our U.S. Omnipod System inventory is held at a single location in Massachusetts and our European Omnipod System inventory is maintained by a third-party logistics entity primarily in a single location in the Netherlands. We take precautions to ensure that Flex and the third-party logistics entity safeguard our assets, including insurance and health and safety protocols and off-site storage of computer data. However, a natural or other disaster, such as a fire or flood, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our manufacturing equipment and/or inventory and cause us to incur additional expenses. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case. With or without insurance, damage to our facility, manufacturing equipment, inventory or other property or to any of our suppliers, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing difficulties, including not effectively managing the start-up and commissioning of new manufacturing lines, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe manufacture of our product requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in two locations, at our U.S. manufacturing facility in Massachusetts and on manufacturing lines owned by us at a facility located in China, operated by a subsidiary of Flex. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply, but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other similar non-U.S. regulatory agencies regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.\nThe manufacture of our product is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue. Significant manufacturing problems or inability to obtain key components and materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, as we commence operation of new manufacturing lines, we could experience quality issues and unexpected operational delays that decrease our gross margins and cause a shortage of product supply.\nOur success will depend on our ability to attract and retain personnel.\nOver the last several years, we have made significant changes to our senior management team and to many other positions throughout the Company. We believe we will benefit substantially from the leadership and performance of these new and promoted employees. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our employees, both domestically and abroad, and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. In addition, it is important to the success of the Company that the transition of new and promoted\nemployees and executives be largely seamless. Competition for senior management personnel, and other highly skilled personnel is intense and there can be no assurances that we will be able to retain our personnel. The loss of the services of members of our senior management, and other highly skilled personnel could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our objectives or divert management\u2019s attention to seeking qualified replacements.\nAdditionally, the sale and after-sale support of the Omnipod System is logistically complex, requiring us to maintain an extensive infrastructure of field sales personnel, diabetes educators, customer support, insurance specialists, and billing and collections personnel. We face considerable challenges in recruiting, training, managing, motivating and retaining these employees, including managing geographically dispersed teams. If we fail to maintain and grow an adequate pool of trained and motivated personnel, our reputation could suffer, and our financial position could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth, our business resources may become strained and we may not be able to deliver the Omnipod System in a timely manner, which could harm our results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our sales internationally, we will need to obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement agreements with government agencies or private third-party payors in those countries. Failure to obtain such agreements would limit our ability to successfully penetrate those foreign markets. In addition, the geographic expansion of our business will require additional manufacturing capacity to supply those markets as well as additional sales and marketing resources.\nWe expect to continue to increase our manufacturing capacity, our personnel and the scope of our U.S. and international sales and marketing efforts. This growth, as well as any other growth that we may experience in the future, will provide challenges to our organization and may strain our management and operations resources. In order to manage future growth, we will be required to improve existing, and implement new, sales and marketing efforts and distribution channels. The form and function of our enterprise information technology systems will need to change and be improved upon as our business needs change. We will need to manage our supply chain effectively, including the development of our U.S. manufacturing, our relationship with Flex and other suppliers going forward. We may also need to partner with additional third-party suppliers to manufacture certain components of the Omnipod System and complete additional manufacturing lines in the future. A transition to new suppliers may result in additional costs or delays. We may misjudge the amount of time or resources that will be required to effectively manage any anticipated or unanticipated growth in our business or we may not be able to manufacture sufficient inventory, or attract, hire and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs. If we cannot scale our business appropriately, maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated and unanticipated growth, our business resources may become strained, we may not be able to deliver the Omnipod System in a timely manner and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we choose to acquire or invest in new businesses, products or technologies, instead of developing them ourselves, these acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and could result in the use of significant amounts of equity, cash or a combination of both.\nFrom time to time we may seek to acquire or invest in new businesses, products or technologies, instead of developing them ourselves. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to complete the acquisition or investment;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing businesses and diversion of management attention;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the acquired entities, products or technologies;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with acquiring intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in operating the acquired business profitably;\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve anticipated synergies, cost savings or growth;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in transitioning and maintaining key customer, distributor and supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs.\nIn addition, any future acquisitions or investments may result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of equity securities, which may be sold at a discount to market price;\n\u2022\nthe use of significant amounts of cash;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of significant liabilities;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs or reduced earnings;\n\u2022\nfinancing obtained on unfavorable terms;\n\u2022\nlarge one-time expenses; and\n\u2022\nthe creation of certain intangible assets, including goodwill, the write-down of which in future periods may result in significant charges to earnings.\nAny of these factors could materially harm our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe need to expand our distribution network to maintain and grow our business and revenue. If we fail to expand and maintain an effective sales force or successfully develop our relationships with intermediaries, our business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe currently promote, market and sell the majority of the Omnipod System through our own direct sales force. However, we also utilize domestic and international intermediaries to distribute our product to end-users. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop our relationships with third-party intermediaries. If we fail to do so, our sales could fail to grow or could decline, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. Intermediaries that are in the business of selling other medical products may not devote a sufficient level of resources and the support required to generate awareness of our products and grow or maintain product sales. If our intermediaries are unwilling or unable to market and sell our products, or if they do not perform to our expectations, we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance and sales of our products.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain and increase production capacity and reduce per unit production costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability of third-party reimbursement in the United States or other countries;\n\u2022\nvolume and timing of orders for our products;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in administrative proceedings or litigation related to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nissuance of patents to us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of technological or medical innovations in the treatment or diagnosis of diabetes;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications;\n\u2022\npublication of clinical studies relating to our products or a competitor\u2019s product;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nAt times, the fluctuations in the market price of our common stock have been unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. In particular, the U.S. equity markets have at times experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Broad market and industry factors such as these could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nConversion of any of our Convertible Senior Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or depress our stock price.\nThe conversion of some or all our Convertible Senior Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nSection 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an annual limit on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership or equity structure. Our ability to use net operating losses may be limited by prior changes in our ownership and may be further limited by the issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of our Convertible Senior Notes, or by the consummation of other transactions. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liabilities for us.", "PERMNO": 92050, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "PODD"}
