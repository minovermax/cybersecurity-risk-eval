{"cik": "897077", "company": "ALAMO GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company\u2019s securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks related to our business\nDeterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, infrastructure maintenance and agricultural markets in general. Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control. Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These factors include the following:\n\u2022weakness in the worldwide economy;\n\u2022the price and availability of raw materials, purchased components and energy;\n\u2022budget constraints and revenue shortfalls for our governmental customers;\n\u2022changes in domestic and foreign governmental policies and laws, including increased levels of governmental regulation and associated liabilities;\n\u2022the levels of interest rates;\n\u2022the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in countries where we sell our products but don\u2019t have a manufacturing presence;\n\u2022impact of tighter credit markets on the Company, its dealers and end-users;\n\u2022impairment in the carrying value of goodwill; and\n\u2022increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.\nIn addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:\n\u2022animal disease outbreaks, epidemics and crop pests;\n\u2022weather conditions, such as droughts, floods and snowstorms;\n\u2022changes in farm incomes;\n\u2022cattle and agricultural commodity prices;\n\u2022changes in governmental agricultural policies worldwide;\n\u2022the level of worldwide farm output and demand for farm products; and\n\u2022limits on agricultural imports/exports.\nA downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.\nThe strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business. Slow or negative growth rates, inflationary/deflationary pressures, higher commodity costs and energy prices, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our dealers and end-user customers, increased unemployment rates, and recessionary economic conditions and outlook could cause consumers to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forgo purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings. In addition, the spread of the coronavirus may also have adverse impacts on global economic activity which could negatively impact our revenues.\nThe exit by the U.K. from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) and the impact of the withdrawal may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by the uncertainty concerning new or modified trading arrangements between the U.K. and other countries. Any of these developments could negatively affect economic growth or business activity in the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere, and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nSignificant changes in trade policy and related trade wars could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe current administration continues to make potentially significant changes in U.S. trade policy and has taken certain actions that have adversely impacted U.S. trade and relationships with China and other trading partners, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S. Any continued actions or further changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \"trade wars.\" Trade wars may lead to reduced economic activity, increased costs, reduced demand and changes in purchasing behaviors for some or all of our products, or other potentially adverse economic outcomes. These or other consequences from any trade wars could have a material adverse impact on our sales volumes, prices and our consolidated financial results.\nWe depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities and related contractors, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products. These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.\nOur dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy. In addition, although most of the raw materials and purchased components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials. If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, higher energy costs could negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products. In addition, a sudden and unrestrained outbreak of human disease could cause disruptions in our supply chain. For example, in 2020 we may experience delays in obtaining or an inability to obtain certain important components from our Chinese suppliers because of a rapid spread of the coronavirus in that country and potential reductions in manufacturing output.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty. The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill was $198,022,000, which represents 16% of total assets.\nThe Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2019, 2018 or 2017. During the 2019 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2019 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units. If we were to have a significant goodwill impairment caused by a greater than 15% decline in fair value, it could impact our results of operations as well as our net worth.\nWe are significantly dependent on information technology and our business may suffer from disruptions associated with information technology, cyber-attacks or other catastrophic losses affecting our IT infrastructure.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers. These information technology systems (some of which are provided and maintained by third parties) may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information or other sensitive information of our customers and employees. The secure use, processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite the information security measures we have taken, our information technology and infrastructure may be subjected to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee malfeasance, employee errors, or other disruptions. Cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s information technology systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the Company\u2019s data and intellectual property. Cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other cyber incidents could include, among other things, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and other\nsimilar attacks. Sensitive information is also stored by our vendors and on the platforms and networks of third-party providers. Cyber-attacks on the Company, our vendors, or our third-party providers could result in inappropriate access to our intellectual property, Company data, or personally identifiable information of our global workforce, suppliers, or customers. Potential consequences of a successful cyber-attack or other cybersecurity breach or incident include remediation costs, legal costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack, litigation and legal risks including governmental or regulatory enforcement actions, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence, and damage to the Company\u2019s competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value. While we have taken steps to address these risks by implementing enhanced security technologies, internal controls, and business continuity plans, these measures may not be adequate.\nChanges in the regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe EU has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect in May of 2018. GDPR extends the scope of the existing EU data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents. The regulation imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of 4% of worldwide turnover or \u20ac20,000,000, whichever is greater, and includes new rights such as the right of erasure of personal data. Although the GDPR applies across the EU, as has been the case under the current data protection regime, EU Member States have some national derogations and local data protection authorities (\u201cDPAs\u201d) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. In addition, certain U.S. states have enacted privacy and data protection laws. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") which became effective in 2020. Implementation of, and compliance with, the GDPR, CCPA and other similar laws could increase our cost of doing business and/or force us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, violations of the GDPR, CCPA and other laws may result in significant fines, penalties and damage to our brand and business which could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal. We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets. Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to develop new products or keep pace with technological developments may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur industry is affected by future technological developments. The introduction of new products or processes with innovative technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success depends, to some extent, upon our ability to develop, market and sell cost-effective new products and applications that keep pace with technological developments in the markets we serve. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products and applications or we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of such new products and applications, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.\nWe have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally. Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022import and export restrictions, tariffs and quotas;\n\u2022additional expenses relating to the difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022labor disputes and uncertain political and economic environments and the impact of foreign business cycles;\n\u2022changes in laws or policies;\n\u2022changes in any international trade agreements, such as any changes in European Union membership;\n\u2022delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits;\n\u2022potentially adverse consequences resulting from the applicability of foreign tax laws;\n\u2022cultural differences;\n\u2022increased expenses due to inflation;\n\u2022weak economic conditions in foreign markets where our subsidiaries distribute their products;\n\u2022changes in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022disruptions in transportation and port authorities; and\n\u2022regulations involving international freight shipments.\nOperating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, United States export control laws, and data privacy laws such as the recently enacted European GDPR. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for noncompliance could significantly and adversely impact our business. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies affecting foreign trade, investment, taxation, and our ability to effectively source components and raw materials internationally. For example, any significant changes in U.S. trade policy, including the introduction of any new or expanded tariffs, could increase the cost of critical materials and supplies that we source internationally or negatively impact international sales of our products, which would have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.\nIn addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products. For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses. To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions. These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, and the businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.\nAcquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy and we have completed a number of acquisitions over the past several years. In 2019, we completed three acquisitions, namely Dutch Power, Dixie Chopper, and Morbark. Acquisitions can be difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022potential negative impact on our earnings per share as a result of acquisition costs and related financing costs, among other things;\n\u2022the assumption of liabilities that are unknown to us at the time of closing;\n\u2022failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales;\n\u2022potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products;\n\u2022disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management\u2019s attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; and\n\u2022potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and vendors.\nIf we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies. We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022we may incur substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial challenges in integrating acquired businesses, including integrating each company's accounting, information technology, human resource and other administrative systems to facilitate effective management;\n\u2022we may be unable to achieve expected cost reductions, to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities, or to eliminate redundant operations, facilities and systems;\n\u2022We may encounter problems in integrating the acquired products with our existing and/or new products;\n\u2022we may need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company which could take a significant amount of time and expense;\n\u2022acquisitions may divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our existing businesses;\n\u2022we may not be able to retain key personnel of acquired businesses;\n\u2022there may be cultural challenges associated with integrating management and employees from the acquired businesses into our organization; and\n\u2022we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances and legal risk and associated liabilities.\nOur integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts. Integrating operations may distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies. Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.\nThe agricultural industry and the infrastructure maintenance industry are seasonal, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nIn general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters. Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow removal equipment, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general. In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand. We utilize an annual plan with updated quarterly sales forecasts provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities. In addition, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods. Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.\nWeather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts. In addition to seasonal factors, the agricultural industry is cyclical in nature with sales largely dependent on the state of the farm economy and, in particular, agriculture commodity prices and farm income. Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.\nExtreme weather conditions may impact demand for some of our products and impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExtreme weather conditions such as droughts or flooding may adversely affect sales of some of our products including our mowing equipment and other agricultural equipment and related parts. Milder winter conditions with lower snowfall accumulations can have an adverse impact on sales of our snow removal equipment and related parts business in the key markets we serve. In the event unfavorable weather conditions are worsened as a result of global climate change, our business may be adversely affected to a more significant extent.\nIf we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.\nOur continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees. We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIncreasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact our ability to sell certain of our products into the market and appropriately price certain of our products, which could negatively affect our competitive position and financial results.\nThe products we manufacture or sell, particularly engines, are subject to increasingly stringent environmental emission regulations. For instance, the EPA has adopted increasingly stringent engine emission regulations, including Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines in specified horsepower ranges that are used in some of our products. As of January 1, 2012, such requirements expanded to additional horsepower categories and, accordingly, apply to more of the products we sell. While we have developed and implemented plans to achieve full and timely compliance with these requirements, our ability to meet the Tier 4 requirements is subject to many variables, some of which are beyond our direct control. If we fail to meet the Tier 4 requirements and any other EPA emission standards that are currently in place or that may be introduced in the future, our ability to sell our products into the market may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and financial results.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nLike other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company\u2019s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future. Like other industrial concerns, the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.\nChanges in environmental laws or new laws relating to climate change and/or the emission of greenhouse gases (\"GHG\") may cause us to make additional investment in new product designs or could increase our environmental compliance expenditures. The regulation of GHG emissions could result in other additional costs to the Company in the form of tax or emissions allowances, facility improvement costs, and higher input costs. Increased input costs and other costs associated with GHG emissions regulation and related compliance may also negatively impact customer demand. Because the timing and extent of GHG emission regulations or climate change regulations are unknown at this time, we are unable to predict the impact this may have on our overall business.\nThe Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety. A variety of state laws regulate the Company\u2019s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements.\nWe are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.\nLike other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business. We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend the Company against such claims. While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants. Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements. If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver. The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us, including a potential increase to the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of our products in international markets. While we do enter into foreign exchange contracts to protect against such fluctuations to an extent (primarily in the U.K. market), we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage these risks. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, such as a devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges concerning the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") may have a negative impact on our business.\nCurrent interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility are variable and include the use of the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may result in fluctuating interest rates that may have a negative impact on our interest expense and our profitability.\nRisks related to investing in our common stock\nBecause the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, it may be difficult for you to resell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nThe trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate. The closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during 2019 ranged from $75.12 to $129.74 per share, and during 2018 from $73.92 to $120.13 per share. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the risk factors set forth herein and to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating and financial results, litigation, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, news reports relating to us or trends in our industry or general economic conditions. The stock price volatility and trading volume may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities, which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock. On December 31, 2019, 11,828,764 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were outstanding options and restricted stock awards totaling an additional 203,725 shares of our common stock. We also have additional shares available for grant under our 2015 Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. Additional stock option or other compensation plans or amendments to existing plans for employees and directors may be adopted. Issuance of these shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, such as the 1,700,000 shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Bush Hog in 2009, future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. This would further dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue declaring dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments.\nOn January 2, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.13 per share. Although we have paid a cash dividend in each quarter since becoming a public company in 1993, there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or that funds will continue to be available for this purpose in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends are restricted by the terms of our credit facility, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, are not cumulative, and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital needs, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nProvisions of our corporate documents may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.\nProvisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include prohibiting stockholders from calling stockholder meetings and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws state that any amendment to certain provisions, including those provisions regarding limitations on action by written consent discussed above, be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of our common stock. We are also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or stockholder approvals were obtained.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of the shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities. If we or our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nCertain stockholders own a significant amount of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, five investors - BlackRock, Inc., Henry Crown and Company, Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, Victory Capital Management Inc., and The Vanguard Group - beneficially owned approximately 45% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the major stockholders combined could be able to significantly influence the direction of the Company, the election of our Board of Directors, and the outcome of any other matter requiring stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and together with other beneficially owned investors, to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company. Also, pursuant to contractual obligations, affiliates of Henry Crown and Company were entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of the common stock owned by them under the Securities Act. Pursuant to such registration rights, on March 12, 2012, we filed a registration statement related to the common stock owned by such entities and such registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. The interests of the major stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 78950, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "ALG"}
