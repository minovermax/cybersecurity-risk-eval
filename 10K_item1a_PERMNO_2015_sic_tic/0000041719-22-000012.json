Our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities at full capacity and in an economical manner which may force us to take machine downtime to curtail production to match demand.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic as the virus spread throughout the world. As the virus, and variants thereof, continued its rapid spread, a significant portion of the world\u2019s economies was adversely impacted, and may continue to be so from time to time, by government mandates intending to slow or reduce the virus' reach such as i) reduced operation of \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses; ii) \u201csocial distancing\u201d; and iii) vaccine mandates. The actions undertaken across the globe in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus have had an unprecedented and significant adverse impact on global economies in terms of reduced GDP, disruptions in global supply chains, increased unemployment, and insolvencies in a variety of industries and markets.\nThe majority of our product portfolios are considered to be \u201cessential or life-sustaining\u201d and we continued to produce products used in the global response effort to the pandemic. However, shortly after the pandemic began and through the first several months of 2021, our financial performance and results of operations were impacted by the pandemic, particularly by weaker demand for tabletop products used by restaurants, catering and similar venues, all of which were impacted by \u201clockdowns\u201d throughout many regions of the world. In the event economic activity continues to be adversely impacted, or the impact intensifies, due to the spread of COVID-19 or due to actions to control the spread, we could be forced to curtail operations further due to reduced customer demand, compliance with government mandates or the inability to adequately staff production facilities due to a widespread or sustained outbreak of COVID-19 at one or more of our facilities. In addition, our global supply chain could be disrupted, demand for our products, or the prices the products are sold, could be adversely impacted if economic conditions in the target markets that we serve remain weak or weaken further. We also could face potential legal actions that could arise due to our operations during the pandemic. This economic environment may also cause customer insolvencies which may result in their inability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. The conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on various economies throughout the world could lead to financial instabilities or insolvencies of some of our customers or the customers they in turn serve which could impact our ability to sell our products. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event the spread continues or the government actions intensify, our results of operations and/or financial position could be adversely impacted.\nApproximately 52% of our net sales in 2021 was from shipments to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products, as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns.\nDisruption of our global supply chain could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to manufacture, sell and distribute products is critical to our operations. Our products contain raw materials that we source globally from suppliers. If there is a shortage of a key material in our supply chain, and a replacement cannot be readily sourced from an alternative supplier, the shortage may disrupt our production. Likewise, disruptions in the transportation and delivery of products - both from suppliers to our production facilities, and from our production facilities to our customers - may impact our ability to sell product and deliver goods to our customers on time.\nGLATFELTER 2021 FORM 10-K 7\nIn addition, the costs of transporting materials and products through our chain of sourcing and production may increase, and such increases could be significant. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our raw materials, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptions, or to effectively manage such disruptions if they occur, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our global supply chain. Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase or the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.\nWe require access to sufficient, and reasonably priced, quantities of pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, polyester or synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our production facilities. We require significant quantities of wood pulps and, therefore, the volatility of wood pulp prices can have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nOur Philippine production site purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea, and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers\u2019 facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop, as well as decisions by landowners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.\nAirlaid Materials requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods.\nThe cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum-based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. Natural gas is the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide and has historically been more volatile than other fuels.\nGovernment rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations.\nAlthough we have contractual arrangements with certain Airlaid Materials and Spunlace customers pursuant to which our product\u2019s selling price is adjusted for changes in the cost of certain raw materials, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant proportion of our net sale and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated \u20ac150 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.\nOur ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices.\nIn the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for our products, pricing of our products, or a customer\u2019s ability to satisfy obligations to us, could be adversely impacted.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our results of operations.\nApproximately $95 million of our net sales in 2021 was earned from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. Uncertain geopolitical conditions, the invasion of Ukraine, sanctions, and other potential impacts on this region\u2019s economic environment and currencies may cause demand for our products to be volatile, cause abrupt changes in our customers' buying patterns, interrupt our ability to supply products to this region or limit customers' access to financial resources and ability to satisfy obligations to us.\nIn addition, we operate manufacturing sites throughout Europe, including Germany, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. In many instances, these sites depend on the availability of natural gas for use in the production of products. The supply of a substantial portion of the natural gas used may originate from Russia.\nIn the event geopolitical tensions fail to abate or deteriorate further, additional governmental sanctions may be enacted adversely impacting this region's economy, its banking and monetary systems, markets or customers for our products, or the supply and cost of natural gas used by our sites.\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.\nThe global markets in which we compete are served by a variety of competitors and a variety of substrates. As a result, our ability to compete is sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by:\n\u2022the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve;\n\u2022the aggressiveness of our competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;\n\u2022our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and\n\u2022technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competitiveness of our products.\nThe impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.\nOur business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022anticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends;\n\u2022develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner;\n\u2022price our products competitively;\n\u2022differentiate our products from our competitors' products; and\n\u2022invest efficiently in research and development activities.\nOur inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.\nWe are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures.\nWe may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include costs for government oversight of the remediation activities, the restoration of natural resources, and/or personal injury and property damages.\nWe generate a substantial portion of Airlaid Materials' and Spunlace's net sales from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAirlaid Materials and Spunlace derive approximately 44% and 6% respectively, of their annual net sales from sales to the feminine hygiene market. In addition, one customer accounted for 36% of Airlaid Materials' and 11% of\nGLATFELTER 2021 FORM 10-K 9\nSpunlace's sales. The balance is concentrated with a small group of large customers. The loss of this one large customer or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on these segment's operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid and spunlace nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for our products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which the segments currently sell their products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.\nOur operations may be impaired, and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.\nIf we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational disruption at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such sites rely on local bodies of water or water sources for their production needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or man-made interruptions to water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur pulp facility in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world\u2019s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this site is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao site supplies the abaca pulp used by Composite Fibers to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss, or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao site could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.\nOur pulp facility in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp facility produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by Composite Fibers and is currently our main source of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine site, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability, or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, net sales, and operating results.\nOur international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.\nWe have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including, but not limited to, economic and trade disruptions resulting from geopolitical developments, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company, or employee information, as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.\nOur business operations rely upon secure systems for site operations, and data capture, processing, storage, and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyberattacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual know-how and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.\nAny of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity, and could have a material effect on our business.\nWe operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\nThe multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions are subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation, changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Also, many jurisdictions continue to adopt tax policies in response to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project. For example, in July of 2021, 130 countries agreed in principle to a framework of international taxation proposed by the OECD that would change the rules of how profit is allocated among countries and impose a global minimum tax rate. These and other developments could significantly negatively impact the Company\u2019s overall tax expense, results of operations, and future cash flows.\nIn the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations and make dividend payments on our common stock.\nIn addition to debt service obligations, our business requires expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate enough cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments.\nWe may not realize the growth opportunities and operational synergies that are anticipated from the Jacob\nHolm acquisition and the Mount Holly acquisition.\nThe benefits that we expect to result from the Jacob Holm acquisition and the Mount Holly acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and operational synergies, and the timing of this realization, will depend in part on the successful integration of the Mount Holly and Jacob Holm businesses.\nThere is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating acquisitions as sizable as the Jacob Holm acquisition and the Mount Holly acquisition. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our Mount Holly\u2019s or Jacob Holm\u2019s business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate Mount Holly\u2019s or Jacob Holm\u2019s business or at all. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to integrate Mount Holly\u2019s or Jacob Holm\u2019s business successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the growth opportunities and operational synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated timeframes or at all.\nGLATFELTER 2021 FORM 10-K 11\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and make payments on the notes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $787.4 million of senior unsecured debt and $118.3 million of revolving commitments available under our Credit Facility (after giving effect to $6.7 million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit). We are able to, and may, incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of our indebtedness, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our long-term debt;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes in the future;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including under the Credit Facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\nAlthough our borrowing arrangements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations, including the repayment of the notes.", "PERMNO": 57154, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "GLT"}
