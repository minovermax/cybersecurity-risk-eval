{"cik": "948708", "company": "SMITH MICRO SOFTWARE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur future operating results are highly uncertain. Before deciding to invest in our common stock or to maintain or change your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our other Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to a concentrated number of clients, and a reduction in sales to any of them may adversely impact our revenues and operating results.\nWe sell our wireless products and solutions primarily to large wireless carriers, cable operators, and OEMs, so there are a limited number of actual and potential customers for our products, resulting in significant customer concentration. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales to T-Mobile (and Sprint, prior to its merger with T-Mobile) and its affiliates comprised 81% of our total revenues.\nBecause of our relatively high customer concentration, a small number of significant customers possess a relative level of pricing and negotiating power over us, enabling them to achieve advantageous pricing and other contractual terms, including the ability to terminate their agreements with us with a limited amount of notice. Any material decrease in our sales to any of these customers would materially affect our revenue and profitability.\nOn April 1, 2020, Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile completed their previously announced merger transaction, with the combined company continuing to operate as T-Mobile. In the event that the combined company does not elect to continue using the solutions that we currently deliver, or our sales to the combined company materially decrease as compared with our sales to Sprint pre-merger, our revenues and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. In addition and in connection with the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, on July 1, 2020, the combined company divested certain assets to DISH Network Corporation, including Sprint\u2019s Boost business. A portion of our solutions sales to Sprint/T-Mobile has historically included sales to Boost. In the event that Boost does not elect to continue using the solutions that we currently deliver to it, or our sales to the divested business materially decrease as compared with our sales to Boost pre-divestiture, our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf there are delays in the distribution of our products or if customer negotiations for our new products cannot occur on a timely basis, we may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to meet the needs of the business in the foreseeable future or at all.\nOur growth depends in part on our customers\u2019 ability and willingness to promote our services and attract and retain new end user customers or achieve other goals outside of our control.\nWe sell our wireless products for use on handheld devices primarily to our carrier, cable/MSO, and enterprise customers, who deploy our products for use by their end user customers. The success of our carrier, cable/MSO and enterprise customers, and their ability and willingness to market services to their end users that are supported by our products, is critical to our future success. Our ability to generate revenues from sales of our software is also constrained by our carrier customers\u2019 ability to attract and retain customers. We have no input into or influence upon their marketing efforts and sales and customer retention activities. If our large carrier customers fail to maintain or grow demand for their services, revenues or revenue growth from our products designed for use on mobile devices will decline and our results of operations will suffer.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and other key technical personnel. We do not have employment agreements with our key employees. The loss of the services of\nour key employees would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, particularly highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing research and development required to develop and enhance our products. Competition for these employees remains high and employee retention is a common problem in our industry. Our inability to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are essential to our product development, marketing, service, and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate revenue, develop new products or product enhancements and generally would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may harm our business.\nThe uninterrupted operation of our hosted solutions and the confidentiality and security of third-party information and materials is critical to our business. Any failures in our security and privacy measures, such as \u201chacking\u201d of our systems by outsiders or the inadequate protection of pre-release mobile devices in our custody, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. If we are unable to protect, or our customers and mobile device manufacturer partners perceive that we are unable to protect, the security and privacy of information and materials in our care, our growth could be materially adversely affected and we could be subject to material liability. A security or privacy breach may:\n\u2022\ncause our customers to lose confidence in our solutions;\n\u2022\ncause our mobile device manufacturer partners to cease doing business with us;\n\u2022\nharm our reputation;\n\u2022\nexpose us to material liability; and\n\u2022\nincrease our expense from potential remediation costs.\nWhile we believe we use proven applications and have established adequate safeguards designed for facility security, data security and integrity to process electronic transactions, there can be no assurance that these applications and safeguards will be adequate to prevent a security breach or to address changing market conditions or the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential customers and device manufacturer partners. In addition, our customers and end users may use our products and services in a manner which violates security or data privacy laws in one or more jurisdictions. Any significant or high profile security breach, data privacy breach or violation of data privacy laws could result in the loss of business and reputation, litigation against us, liquidated and other damages, and regulatory investigations and penalties that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nInterruptions or delays in service from data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our customers from data center hosting facilities. Any damage to, or failure of, such facilities generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their on-demand services, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.\nThe success of our products depends upon effective operation with operating systems, devices, networks and standards that we do not control and on our continued relationships with mobile operating system providers and device manufacturers.\nWe are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular operating systems, networks and standards that we do not control. For example, we depend upon the interoperability of our mobile products with the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. Any changes, bugs or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products\u2019 functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products, or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect the usage of our products.\nWe maintain relationships with mobile device manufacturers which provide us with insights into product development and emerging technologies. These insights allow us to keep abreast of, or to anticipate, market trends and help us to serve our current and prospective customers. Mobile device manufacturers are under no obligation to continue providing us with these valuable insights. If we are unable to maintain our existing relationships with mobile device\nmanufacturers, if we fail to enter into relationships with additional mobile device manufacturers, or if mobile device manufacturers favor one of our competitors, our ability to provide products that meet our current and prospective customers\u2019 needs could be compromised and our reputation and future revenue prospects could suffer. For example, if our software does not function well with a popular mobile device because we have not maintained a relationship with its manufacturer, carriers seeking to provide that device to their respective customers may choose an alternative solution. Even if we succeed in establishing and maintaining these relationships, they may not result in additional customers or revenues.\nOur products may contain undetected software defects, which could negatively affect our revenues.\nOur software products are complex and may contain undetected defects. If we discover software defects in our products we may experience delayed or lost revenues during the period it takes to correct these problems. Defects, whether actual or perceived, could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenues, product returns, a delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position or claims against us by customers. Any such problems could be costly to remedy and could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product sales, which could cause us to lose existing or prospective customers and could negatively affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Industry and Macroeconomic Conditions\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from only a few core vertical markets, and changes within these vertical markets, or failure to penetrate new markets, could adversely impact our revenues and operating results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few vertical markets, such as wireless carriers and cable operators. In order to sustain and grow our business, we must continue to sell our software products in these vertical markets. Shifts in the dynamics of these vertical markets, such as new product introductions by our competitors, could materially harm our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Increasing our sales outside our core vertical markets and into markets in which we do not have significant experience, for example to large enterprises, would require us to devote time and resources to hire and train sales employees familiar with those industries. Even if we are successful in hiring and training sales teams, customers in other vertical markets may not need or sufficiently value our current products or new product introductions.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by public health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 global health pandemic.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world. The circumstances relating to the pandemic are complex and evolving, with a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain the spread of the virus globally. We have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect our employees\u2019 health and well-being, including having office employees work remotely, suspending employee travel, and withdrawing from certain industry events. The duration and extent of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business, operations and financial results depends on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the ongoing transmission rate and mutation of the virus, emergence of new variants and strains with different characteristics, the extent and effectiveness of containment and mitigation actions, including distribution and effectiveness of vaccines, the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, industry partners, and suppliers.\nMany of our customers and suppliers have temporarily modified their business operations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and related government restrictions. Our customers have experienced and may continue to experience decreased demand for the value-added products and services that we provide to them and may seek to terminate, suspend or delay existing or new initiatives involving our products and services. A decrease in demand for our products and services or the termination, suspension or delay of existing or new initiatives by our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth herein.\nIn the event of illnesses to key employees or a significant portion of our workforce resulting from COVID-19, we may experience inefficiencies, delays, and/or disruptions in research and development activities and increased costs\nresulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, all of which may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nAdditionally, government intervention with respect to the pandemic, continued widespread growth in infections, travel restrictions, quarantines, or other business and industry closures as a result of the pandemic could, among other things, impact the ability of our employees and contractors to perform their duties, cause increased technology and security risk due to extended and company-wide telecommuting, lead to disruptions with our suppliers, hamper our ability to integrate recent technology acquisitions and cause disruption in our relationship with our customers or prospective customers.\nTechnology and customer needs change rapidly in our market, which could render our products obsolete and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, including changes in the Microsoft, Google, and Apple operating systems with which our products are designed to be compatible, and to changes in customer demands. The communications software markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards, and short product life cycles. Any of these factors could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. New products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods as a result of the complexities inherent in today\u2019s mobile technology environment and the performance demanded by customers. If our target markets do not develop as we anticipate, if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets, or if we are unable to develop new versions of our software products that can operate on future wireless networks and PC and mobile device operating systems and interoperate with relevant third party technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition within our target markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors and new entrants, which could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe operate in markets that are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. Because there are low barriers to entry into the software markets in which we participate and may participate in the future, we expect significant competition to continue from both established and emerging software companies, domestic and international. In fact, our growth opportunities in new product markets could be limited to the extent established and emerging software companies enter or have entered those markets.\nMany of our other current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical, and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Announcements of competing products by competitors could result in the cancellation of orders by customers in anticipation of the introduction of such new products. In addition, some of our competitors are currently making complementary products that are sold separately. Such competitors could decide to enhance their competitive position by bundling their products to attract customers seeking integrated, cost-effective software applications. Some competitors have a retail emphasis and offer OEM products with a reduced set of features. The opportunity for retail upgrade sales may induce these and other competitors to make OEM products available at their own cost or even at a loss. We also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations, which may lead to the creation of additional large and well-financed competitors. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, and loss of market share.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal, business, and economic risks specific to international operations.\nIn recent years, our revenues derived from sales to customers outside the U.S. have not been material. Our revenues derived from such sales can vary from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We also frequently ship products to our domestic customers\u2019 international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors. In the future, we may expand these international business activities. International operations are subject to many inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral political, social and economic instability;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual property;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including without limitation data privacy laws, such as the GDPR in Europe;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements and restrictions of the United States and any other country in which we operate;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nforeign technical standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in securing and servicing international customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and any imposition of currency exchange controls; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nThese conditions may increase our cost of doing business. Moreover, as our customers are adversely affected by these conditions, our business with them may be disrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nEvolving information security and data privacy laws and regulations may result in increased compliance costs, impediments to the development or performance of our offerings, and monetary or other penalties.\nBecause our solutions process customer data that may contain personally identifying information, we are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the privacy and protection of such data. These laws and regulations address a range of issues, including data privacy, cybersecurity and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, retention or transfer of data. The regulatory framework for data privacy and cybersecurity issues worldwide can vary substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. New laws that have been recently enacted may require considerable resources to ensure timely and ongoing compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January of 2020 gives new data privacy rights to California residents and requires expenditure of considerable resources to establish the necessary internal infrastructure to allow for the monitoring and other compliance requirements, which may limit the use and adoption of our offerings.\nFurther, foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. In the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR includes operational and governance requirements for companies that collect or process personal data of residents of the European Union, and provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these laws and regulations may become substantial and may limit the use and adoption of our offerings, require us to change our business practices, impede the performance and development of our solutions, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance with such laws or regulations.\nRegulations affecting our customers and us and future regulations, to which they or we may become subject to, may harm our business.\nCertain of our customers in the communications industry are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, which could have an indirect effect on our business. In addition, the U.S. telecommunications industry has been subject to continuing deregulation since 1984. We cannot predict when, or upon what terms and conditions, further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect regulation or deregulation may have on demand for our products\nfrom customers in the communications industry. Demand for our products may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those products, which may increase our costs and expenses.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and we may be subject to claims for intellectual property infringement, which could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur success is dependent upon our software code base, our programming methodologies and other intellectual properties and proprietary rights. In order to protect our proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, patents, and copyright and trademark law. We currently own U.S. trademark registrations for certain of our trademarks and U.S. patents for certain of our technologies. However, these measures afford us only limited protection. For our mobile applications that are distributed by our carrier customers to their end users, we rely on our carrier customers to establish binding end user terms. It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain our rights without our authorization. It is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours. It may be difficult for us to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In addition, we sometimes include open source software in our products. As a result of our use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent independent development, unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of trademarks, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights asserted by companies in our industry grows and the coverage of these patents and other rights and the conduct of our business, including the functionality of our products, increasingly overlap. From time to time, we have received communications from third parties asserting that our trade name or features, content, or trademarks of certain of our products infringe upon intellectual property rights held by such third parties. We have also received correspondence from third parties separately asserting that our products may infringe on certain patents held by each of the parties. Although we are not aware that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others, third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to our current or future products. Additionally, our customer agreements require that we indemnify our customers for infringement claims made by third parties involving our intellectual property, including our software code, embedded in their products. Infringement claims, whether with or without merit, could result in time-consuming and costly litigation, divert the attention of our management, cause product shipment delays, result in our sales being enjoined, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties. If we are required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, they may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. An injunction or unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements could seriously impair our ability to market our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading on NASDAQ, which would likely reduce the liquidity of our common stock and could cause our trading price to decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Stock Market. We are required to meet specified financial requirements in order to maintain our listing on NASDAQ. If we fail to satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ and our common stock would instead trade on the OTC Market. Any potential delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility of our common stock, and would likely cause our trading price to decline.\nFinancial, Investment and Indebtedness Risks\nWe may raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money in order to meet our capital needs. Additional funds to allow us to meet our capital needs may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe believe that our cash and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for the next twelve months. However, it is possible that we may need or choose to obtain additional financing\nto fund our future activities. We could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail our operations or other business activities significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets.\nIt is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently anticipated. The amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nthe levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nour business, product, capital expenditure, and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps;\n\u2022\nthe levels of working capital that we maintain;\n\u2022\ncapital improvements to new and existing facilities;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 response to our products; and\n\u2022\nour relationships with suppliers and customers.\nIn addition, we may raise additional capital to accommodate planned growth, hiring, and infrastructure needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, products or technologies.\nThe Company has a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future, and may not maintain profitability.\nWe have undertaken recent efforts to align expenses with our current and projected revenue. However, if we do not achieve certain revenue targets, we may need to undertake further restructurings, we may incur additional operating losses, and we may not be able to maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to meet our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months, the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe believe that we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months, primarily based on our current working capital levels, our current financial projections, and our ability to secure short-term loans and raise capital when necessary.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is substantially dependent upon multiple factors, which primarily include those factors set forth above. If our financial performance and cash flow position the Company unfavorably compared to our internal plans and projections, we may need to consider additional actions to mitigate conditions or events that would raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, including the following:\n\u2022\nRaising additional capital through short-term loans.\n\u2022\nImplementing additional restructuring and cost reductions.\n\u2022\nRaising additional capital through a private placement or other transaction.\n\u2022\nDisposing of or discontinuing one or more product lines.\n\u2022\nSelling or licensing intellectual property.\nShould our going concern assumption not be appropriate or should we become unable to continue in the normal course of operations, adjustments would be required to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities within our consolidated financial statements, and these adjustments could be significant. Our consolidated financial statements do\nnot reflect the adjustments or reclassifications of assets and liabilities that would be necessary if we were to become unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur operating income or loss may continue to change due to shifts in our sales mix and variability in our operating expenses.\nOur operating income or loss can change quarter to quarter and year to year due to a change in our sales mix and the timing of our continued investments in research and development and infrastructure. We continue to invest in research and development, which is the lifeline of our technology portfolio. The timing of these additional expenses can vary significantly quarter to quarter and even from year to year.\nOther General Risks\nOur acquisitions of companies or technologies may disrupt our business and divert management attention and cause our other operations to suffer.\nWe have historically made targeted acquisitions of businesses or product lines with technology important to our business strategy and expect to continue to do so in the future. Most recently, we acquired the operator business from Circle Media Labs Inc. and prior to that our smart retail business, known as ViewSpot. As part of any acquisition, we are required to assimilate the operations, products, and, where applicable, personnel of the acquired businesses and train, retain, and motivate key personnel needed for the successful integration of the acquired business. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts. Additionally, as we integrate any newly acquired business into our existing operations, process changes may result in unanticipated or unintended delays in sales of acquired products or services, which could adversely affect our relationships with customers of the acquired business and result in lower revenues from the acquired business than anticipated. Acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management\u2019s attention from our Company\u2019s day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with our existing employees, customers, and strategic partners. Acquisitions may also subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition.\nWe may also have to incur debt or issue equity securities in order to finance future acquisitions. Our financial condition could be harmed to the extent we incur substantial debt or use significant amounts of our cash resources in acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders. In addition, we expect our profitability could be adversely affected because of acquisition-related accounting costs, write offs, amortization expenses, and charges related to acquired intangible assets. In consummating acquisitions, we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have had limited or no prior experience. If we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses, products, or technologies within existing operations, we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe rely directly and indirectly on third-party intellectual property and licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMany of the Company\u2019s products and services include third-party intellectual property, which require licenses directly to us or to unrelated companies that provide us with sublicenses and/or execution of services for the operation of our business. The Company has historically been able to obtain such licenses or sublicenses on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. If the Company or our third-party service providers are unable to obtain or renew critical licenses on reasonable terms, we may be forced to terminate or curtail our products and services which rely on such intellectual property, and our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and could fall below analyst or investor expectations, which could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our operating results do not\nmeet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline. Fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of a key customer;\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of orders from and shipments to our major customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or increase gross margins;\n\u2022\nvariations in our sales channels or the mix of our product sales;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate market needs and to identify, develop, complete, introduce, market and produce new products and technologies in a timely manner to address those needs;\n\u2022\nthe availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products;\n\u2022\nacquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe effect of new and emerging technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing of acceptance of new mobile services by users of our customers\u2019 services;\n\u2022\ndeferrals of orders by our customers in anticipation of new products, applications, product enhancements or operating systems; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nWe have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders. In any given quarter, our sales may involve large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers. As a result, the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of orders could materially impact our revenues, which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance. Also, we have often recorded a large amount of our sales in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month. Accordingly, delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenues to fall substantially short of anticipated levels. Significant sales may also occur earlier than expected, which could cause operating results for later quarters to compare unfavorably with operating results from earlier quarters.\nFuture orders may come from new customers or from existing customers for new products. The sales cycles may be greater than what we have experienced in the past, increasing the difficulty to predict quarterly revenues.\nBecause we sell primarily to large carriers, cable/MSOs and OEM customers, we have no direct relationship with most end users of our products. This indirect relationship delays feedback and blurs signals of change in the quick-to-evolve wireless ecosystem, and is one of the reasons we have difficulty predicting demand.\nA large portion of our operating expenses, including rent, depreciation and amortization, is fixed and difficult to reduce or change. Accordingly, if our total revenue does not meet our expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue. In that event, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this Report, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance.", "PERMNO": 82281, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SMSI"}
