{"cik": "1512499", "company": "LINDBLAD EXPEDITIONS HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K and the other public statements we make.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nAdverse worldwide economic, geopolitical or other conditions could reduce the demand for expedition travel and adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition, including potentially impairing the value of our fleet, goodwill and other assets.\nThe demand for travel experiences, including expedition cruises and land-based travel may be affected by international, national and local economic and geopolitical conditions. In particular, challenging global economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary income and consumer confidence may, in turn, result in expedition booking slowdowns, decreased expedition prices and lower onboard revenues for the expedition and cruise industries as compared to more robust economic times. In addition, any significant deterioration of global economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns, depressed expedition prices and reduced onboard revenues. Demand for our expedition cruises and land-based trips may also be influenced by geopolitical events. Unfavorable conditions, such as cross-border conflicts, civil unrest and governmental changes, can undermine consumer demand and/or pricing for expeditions in areas affected by such conditions.\nIncidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry, the expedition travel industry, or the travel industry in general, weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations.\nThe operation of cruise ships, airplanes, land tours, port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, mechanical failures, environmental incidents, including oil spills, and other incidents which may bring into question safety, health, security and vacation satisfaction, could negatively impact our reputation. Incidents involving cruise ships, and, in particular the safety and security of guests and crew, media coverage thereof, as well as adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry, have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our expedition cruises and pricing in the industry. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by those incidents. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year. In addition, incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business, increasing government or other regulatory oversight and, in the case of incidents involving our fleet, potential litigation.\nOur fleet and port facilities may also be adversely impacted by weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and changes in ice flows. It is possible that we could be forced to alter itineraries or cancel an expedition or a series of expeditions due to these or other factors, which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, these and any other events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests or crew to our expeditions and/or interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance.\nShip construction, repair or revitalization delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of expeditions or unscheduled drydockings and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on shipyards to construct, repair, maintain and revitalize our ships on a timely basis and to ensure they remain in good working order. The sophisticated nature of building, repairing and revitalizing a ship involves risks. Delays in ship construction, repair or revitalization or mechanical faults have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of expeditions or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships. If there is a significant accident, mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship, we may have to place a ship in drydock for an extended period for repairs. Any such unscheduled drydockings, interruptions or disruptions in service of any of our vessels resulting from weather conditions, natural disasters, mechanical failures or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue, increased operating expenses, or both, and thus adversely affect our results of operations.\nDelays or cost overruns in building new vessels (including the failure to deliver new vessels) could harm us.\nBuilding new vessels is subject to risks of delay (including the failure to timely deliver new vessels to customers) or cost overruns caused by one or more of the following:\n\u25cf unforeseen engineering or construction problems;\n\u25cf changes to design specifications;\n\u25cf delays or unanticipated shortages with respect to necessary materials, equipment or skilled labor;\n\u25cf inability to obtain the requisite permits, approvals or certifications from governmental authorities and the applicable classification society upon completion of work;\n\u25cf financial difficulties of the shipyard building a vessel, including bankruptcy;\n\u25cf lack of shipyard availability;\n\u25cf work stoppages; and\n\u25cf weather interference.\nSignificant delays, cost overruns and failure to timely deliver new vessels we have committed to service one or more of our customers could adversely affect us in several ways, including delaying the implementation of our business strategies or materially increasing our cost of servicing our commitments to our customers.\nWe must make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and/or expand our fleet.\nWe must make substantial capital expenditures to maintain our fleet in good working order. Maintenance capital expenditures include capital expenditures associated with drydocking a vessel, modifying an existing vessel or acquiring a new vessel. These expenditures could increase as a result of changes in the cost of labor and materials; customer requirements; increases in our fleet size or the cost of replacement vessels; governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards relating to safety, security or the environment; and competitive standards. In addition, maintenance capital expenditures will vary from quarter to quarter based on the number of vessels drydocked during that quarter. Significant unexpected maintenance capital expenditures could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe will make substantial capital expenditures to increase the size of our fleet. We intend to expand our fleet by constructing new vessels or acquiring existing vessels from other parties. We generally will be required to make installment payments on any new shipbuild prior to their delivery in the future. Accordingly, we may be required to expend a significant amount of money to acquire or build a vessel for delivery well in the future.\nAn increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our expedition sales and/or pricing.\nExpedition sales and/or pricing may be impacted both by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace and by deployment decisions of us and our competitors. The further growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders, without an increase in the cruise industry\u2019s share of the vacation market, could depress expedition prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement. In addition, to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand, we may consider pricing adjustments, which may result in lower than anticipated profitability. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships, goodwill and other assets.\nFears of terrorist and pirate attacks, war, and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nEvents such as terrorist and pirate attacks, war, and other hostilities and the resulting political instability, travel restrictions, the spread of contagious diseases, such as the Zika virus, and concerns over safety, health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry. In view of our global operations, we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events, which could decrease demand and adversely affect our business.\nWe may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market.\nWe operate in the vacation market, and expedition cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation. We therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines, but also to other vacation operators, who provide other leisure options, including hotels, resorts and package holidays and tours.\nWe face significant competition from other vacation operators and cruise companies on the basis of pricing, destination, travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests. Our competition within the expedition and cruise vacation industries depends on the destination and is fragmented and primarily comprised of private operators.\nIn the event that we do not differentiate our offerings or otherwise do not compete effectively with other vacation operators and cruise companies, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nConducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks.\nWe operate our business globally and plan to continue to expand our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including unstable local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, government controlled fuel prices, difficulties in operating under local business environments, U.S. and global anti-bribery laws or regulations, imposition of trade barriers, and restrictions on repatriation of earnings. If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected, including potentially impairing the value of our ships, goodwill and other assets.\nOperating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. However, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them.\nFailure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur efforts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful.\nWhile our historical focus has been to serve guests from the North American expedition cruise market, we are expanding our focus to include other global markets. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment. There can be no assurance that any new markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in any new markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, including potentially impairing the value of our goodwill.\nIf our redeployment of vessels to a new market with new itineraries is not successful, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict whether new expeditions and new itineraries offered by any vessels redeployed will attract a number of guests comparable to previous expeditions. If redeployments and new expeditions do not attract as many guests as past expeditions or if there is a delay in finalizing or marketing the new itineraries, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nFailure to develop the value of our brand and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends on the strength and continued development of our expedition brand and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies. Failure to protect and differentiate our brand from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations. We have a co-branding strategy with National Geographic, which is memorialized through an Alliance and License Agreement. Failure to maintain our relationship with National Geographic as a result of a breach of the Alliance and License Agreement, a termination event caused by a change of control in which Sven-Olof Lindblad or his designated successor ceases to hold a senior management role with the company, a termination due to our failure to achieve specified year over year revenue growth percentage requirements, a failure to meet the conditions necessary to extend the relationship through 2025, or otherwise could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have an on-going partnership with National Geographic. Termination or alterations in this relationship may have an adverse effect on our business.\nNational Geographic is one of the largest non-profit scientific and educational institutions in the world. Its interests include geography, archaeology and natural science, the promotion of environmental and historical conservation, and the study of world culture and history. In furtherance of similar interests and goals, we have entered into a Tour Operator Agreement and an Alliance and License Agreement (collectively, the \u201cNG Agreements\u201d) with National Geographic.\nPursuant to the NG Agreements, our owned vessels contain the phrase \u201cNational Geographic\u201d in their names, we have access to certain of National Geographic\u2019s marks and images for advertising purposes and we and our guests have access to National Geographic photographers, naturalists and other experts. If the NG Agreements are terminated or the terms of the NG Agreements are modified in any material respect, due to any of the reasons set forth above or otherwise, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a relationship with World Wildlife Fund (\u201cWWF\u201d) through our Natural Habitat subsidiary. Termination or alterations in this relationship may have an adverse effect on our Natural Habitat business.\nWWF is a leading conservation organization whose mission is to conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth. Natural Habitat partners with WWF to offer conservation travel, sustainable travel that directly protects nature through a license agreement that allows Natural Habitat to use the WWF name and logo in return for a royalty fee, through 2023.\nIf Natural Habitat\u2019s license agreement with World Wildlife Fund was terminated or the terms of the agreement were modified in any material respect, our results of operations for the Natural Habitat segment may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations.\nAny circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise and land-based travel spending, such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry, the expedition cruise industry, or the travel industry, could negatively affect our operating cash flows.\nAlthough we believe that we have sufficient cash flows from operations and will have sufficient access to capital to fund our operations and obligations as expected, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to access additional funding as and when needed, our ability to timely refinance and/or replace outstanding debt and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the condition of the financial markets, our financial performance and credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general.\nAny inability to satisfy any covenants required by existing or future credit facilities could adversely impact our liquidity.\nOn March 7, 2016, we entered into a second amended and restated agreement with Credit Suisse A.G. (\u201cCredit Suisse\u201d) as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, amending our existing senior secured credit facility with Credit Suisse. The Restated Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that, among other things, (i) require us to maintain a total net leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00, with 0.25 equal reductions annually thereafter until March 31, 2020, when the total net leverage ratio shall be 3.50 to 1.00 thereafter; (ii) limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur generally and specifically for intercompany debt, debt incurred to finance acquisitions and improvements, for capital and synthetic lease obligations, for standby letters of credit, and in connection with refinancings; (iii) limit the amount we may spend in connection with certain types of investments; and (iv) require the delivery of certain periodic financial statements and an operating budget. The Restated Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets.\nAny failure to comply with such terms, conditions, and covenants could result in an event of default. Further, if an event of default under a credit facility were to occur, cross default provisions, if any, could cause our other outstanding debt, if any, to be immediately due and payable. Upon such an occurrence, there could be no assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the borrowings under any such credit facilities or settle other outstanding contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default.\nEnvironmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs.\nThe United States and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies, such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels, increasing fuel efficiency requirements, further restricting emissions, or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our cost for fuel, cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase and/or develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry. Some environmental groups, in particular, have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact. An increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs, but also some of our other expenses, such as crew travel, freight, air travel, and commodity prices.\nIn addition, we are subject to various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, safety standards applicable to our ships, treatment of disabled persons, health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests, security standards on board our ships and at the ship/port interface areas, and financial responsibilities to our guests. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world, especially in light of several recent incidents involving cruise ships. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.\nOur operating costs, especially fuel expenditures, could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control.\nExpenditures for fuel represent a significant cost of operating our business. If fuel prices rise significantly in a short period of time, we may be unable to increase fares or other fees sufficiently to offset fully our increased fuel costs. In addition, volatility in fuel prices or disruptions in fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur other capital expenditure and operating costs, including food, hotel, payroll, maintenance and repair, airfare, taxes, insurance and security costs, are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control. Increases in these capital expenditure and operating costs could adversely affect our profitability.\nPrice increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reductions in commercial airline service and/or availability could increase our operating expenses and adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests.\nMost of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our expeditions embark or disembark passengers. Increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the expedition vacation to our guests, which may adversely impact demand for our expeditions. In addition, changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests\u2019 ability to obtain air transport, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks that, if realized, could adversely impact our business.\nBecause we rely on travel agencies to generate bookings for our ships, we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive. If we fail to offer competitive compensation packages, these agencies may be incentivized to sell vacation packages offered by our competitors to our detriment, which could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income. Significant disruptions or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our expeditions, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur principal executive office is located in New York, New York, our principal shoreside operations are located in Seattle, Washington. Actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, and floods), terrorist attacks, or other similar disruptive events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation and results of operations. In addition, substantial or repeated information systems failures, computer viruses or cyber-attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business. We do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside operations or our information systems. As such, any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, recognize assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including, among others, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar, the Swedish Krona, and the British Pound. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 11%, 15%, and 19%, respectively, of our guest ticket revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must convert revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, absent offsetting changes in other foreign currencies, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect our revenues, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. We use limited financial instruments to mitigate our net balance sheet exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, there can be no assurances that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, would not materially affect our financial results.\nIn addition, we have ship maintenance contracts and may in the future have ship construction contracts which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We may in the future enter into, forward contracts and collar options to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these contracts, we are or may be exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates for the portions of the contracts that have not been hedged. Additionally, if a shipyard is unable to perform under such a contract, any foreign currency forward contracts that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated. Termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss.\nThe loss of key personnel, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel, or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the skills and contributions of key executives (including Sven-Olof Lindblad, in particular) and other employees, and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality personnel. Our management team is comprised of individuals with a diverse knowledge base and skill sets acquired through extensive experience in expedition cruising, adventure travel, and hospitality. We must continue to sufficiently recruit, retain, train and motivate our employees to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A loss of key executives or other key employees or disruptions among our personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers of various services integral to the operation of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.\nIn order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses. We are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. A failure to adequately monitor a third-party service provider\u2019s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us.\nThere is also a risk that the confidentiality, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised. Such a breach could adversely affect our reputation and in turn adversely affect our business.\nA failure to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence could impair our operations or competitive position.\nOur business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, such as reservations and reporting systems. These technologies and systems must be refined, updated, and/or replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our guests\u2019 demands and expectations. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal information.\nWe are subject to various risks associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information, including risks related to compliance with applicable laws and other contractual obligations, as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised. In the course of doing business, we collect large volumes of internal and guest data, including personally identifiable information for various business purposes. If we fail to maintain compliance with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards, we could be exposed to fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation or other expenses, and our business could be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. Any breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nA change in our tax status under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), or other jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our income.\nAt the present time, our subsidiaries that are foreign corporations do not derive any significant income from sources within the United States, and are not subject to significant United States federal income taxes. Any income earned by these subsidiaries from sources within the United States generally is subject to United States federal income tax (and United States branch profits tax) unless the requirements of the exemption under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code are met. Although we expect that any United States source income of our foreign subsidiaries will generally qualify for the benefits of the Section 883 exemption, there is no assurance that such benefits will be available.\nRestrictions on travel or access to certain protected or preserved areas could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our expedition itineraries are a major reason why guests choose our expedition cruises over competing cruises and vacation options. However, our ability to follow our planned itinerary for any expedition cruise may be affected by a number of factors, including security concerns, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, local government regulations and restrictions, and other restrictions on access, including access to protected or preserved areas.\nFor instance, the number of visitors admitted to the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park at any given time is limited by the number of cupos permits issued by the Gal\u00e1pagos National Parks Service. In June 2015, a new Ecuadorian Special Law for Protected Areas was approved and updated in November 2015. A Presidential Decree issued by President Correa of Ecuador in November 2015 established that cupos, which were in effect as of July 2015, will have a validity of nine years. Our operating rights are up for renewal in July 2024 and based on the new law, we will begin the renewal process in 2020. The current \u201cowners\u201d of the cupos will have the opportunity to re-apply for them, but any other enterprise or individual will have the opportunity to bid for the cupos. All bidders must present proof that they fulfill the conditions to properly utilize the license (access to a vessel, experience in tourism, proven environmental behavior, marketing, etc.). If the Gal\u00e1pagos National Parks Service were to further restrict access to the park, we might be required to alter certain of our travel itineraries, which would negatively impact our business and revenues.\nFurther, changes in other governmental and environmental rules and regulations in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and elsewhere could cause sudden losses in revenue and additional expenditures for alterations in our itineraries. Restrictions on access by us and our guests to other protected or preserved areas, including national parks, may result in losses in revenues typically generated by our expeditions to such areas.\nIn addition, our expedition voyages in Cuba are currently allowed under a general license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of Treasury authorizing the organization and implementation of people-to-people trips to Cuba. Any change in regulations or limitations with respect to the general license, or a change in law or regulation by the Cuban government, could limit our ability to conduct our voyages in Cuba, which may result in losses in revenue.\nLitigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation.\nOur business is subject to various United States and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees, agents, partners, or expedition representatives could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances, it may not be economical to defend against such matters and/or a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, as a result of any ship-related or other incidents, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us and/or our subsidiaries. The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. Subject to applicable insurance coverage, we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments, fines, civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined.\nFailure to comply with international safety regulations may subject us to increased liability that may adversely affect our insurance coverage resulting in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports which could adversely affect our business.\nThe operation of vessels is affected by the requirements of the International Maritime Organization\u2019s International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention (\u201cISM Code\u201d). The ISM Code requires ship owners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive \u201cSafety Management System\u201d that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. Our failure to comply with the ISM Code may subject us to increased liability, invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and result in a denial of access to or detention in certain ports, all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nCompliance with environmental and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nExtensive and changing environmental protection and other laws and regulations directly affect the operation of our vessels. These laws and regulations take the form of international conventions and agreements, including the International Maritime Organization conventions and regulations and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, which are applicable to all internationally trading vessels, and national, state and local laws and regulations, all of which are amended frequently. Under these laws and regulations, various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies and other regulatory authorities may require us to obtain permits, licenses and certificates in connection with our operations. Some countries in which we operate have laws that restrict the nationality of a vessel\u2019s crew and prior and future ports of call, as well as other considerations relating to particular national interests. Changes in governmental regulations and safety or other equipment standards may require unbudgeted expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment for our vessels.\nAn inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we maintain comprehensive insurance and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels, there can be no assurance that all of our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance. Such losses, to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance, could affect our financial results. If we were to sustain significant losses in the future, our ability to obtain insurance coverage at all or at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, irrespective of the occurrence of such events, there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all.\nIf we do not restrict the amount of ownership of our common stock by non-U.S. citizens, we could be prohibited from operating vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, which would adversely impact our business and operating results.\nTo the extent any of our United States flagged vessels are engaged in U.S. coastwise trade, we will be subject to the Jones Act, which governs, among other things, the ownership and operation of passenger vessels used to carry cargo and passengers between U.S. ports. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S. flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and beneficially owned and operated by U.S. organized companies that are controlled and at least 75% owned by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. A failure to maintain compliance would adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations and we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade during any period in which we do not comply or cannot demonstrate to the satisfaction of the relevant governmental authorities our compliance with the Jones Act. In addition, a failure to maintain compliance could subject us to fines and our vessels could be subject to seizure and forfeiture for violations of the Jones Act and the related U.S. vessel documentation laws.\nRestrictions on non-U.S. citizen ownership of certain U.S. flagged vessels could limit our ability to sell off a portion of our business or result in the forfeiture of certain of our vessels.\nCompliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act beneficially own no more than 24.99% in the entities that directly or indirectly own the vessels that operate in the U.S. coastwise trade. If we were to seek to sell any portion of our business that owns any of these vessels, we would have fewer potential purchasers, because some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the U.S. citizenship restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of the business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market. Furthermore, if at any point we or any of the entities that directly or indirectly own our vessels cease to satisfy the requirements to be a U.S. citizen within the meaning of the Jones Act, we would become ineligible to operate in the U.S. coastwise trade and may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of our United States flagged vessels.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the beneficial ownership of our common stock by individuals and entities that are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in non-U.S. citizens being required to disgorge profits, sell their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights.\nUnder the Jones Act, and so long as we operate U.S. flagged vessels in coastwise trade, at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class or series of our capital stock must be beneficially owned and controlled by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation are intended to facilitate compliance with this requirement and may have an adverse effect on certain holders or proposed transferees of shares of our common stock.\nUnder the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, any transfer, or attempted transfer, of any shares of capital stock will be void if the effect of such transfer, or attempted transfer, would be to cause one or more non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate to own (of record or beneficially) shares of any class or series of our capital stock in excess of 22% of the outstanding shares of such class or series. The liquidity or market value of the shares of common stock may be adversely impacted by such transfer restrictions.\nIn the event such restrictions voiding transfers would be ineffective for any reason, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any transfer would otherwise result in the number of shares of any class or series of capital stock owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens being in excess of 22% of the outstanding shares of such class or series, such transfer will cause such excess shares to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries that are U.S. citizens. The proposed transferee will have no rights in the shares transferred to the trust, and the trustee, who is a U.S. citizen chosen by us and unaffiliated with us or the proposed transferee, will have all voting, dividend and distribution rights associated with the shares held in the trust. The trustee will sell such excess shares to a U.S. citizen within 20 days of receiving notice from us and distribute to the proposed transferee the lesser of the price that the proposed transferee paid for such shares and the amount received from the sale, and any gain from the sale will be paid to the charitable beneficiary of the trust.\nThese trust transfer provisions also apply to situations where ownership of a class or series of capital stock by non-U.S. citizens in excess of 22% would be exceeded by a change in the status of a record or beneficial owner thereof from a U.S. citizen to a non-U.S. citizen, in which case such person will receive the lesser of the market price of the shares on the date of such status change and the amount received from the sale. In addition, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if the sale or other disposition of shares of common stock would result in non-U.S. citizens owning (of record or beneficially) in excess of 22% of the outstanding shares of common stock, the excess shares shall be automatically transferred to a trust for disposal by a trustee in accordance with the trust transfer provisions described above. As part of the foregoing trust transfer provisions, the trustee will be deemed to have offered the excess shares in the trust to us at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the market price on the date we accept the offer and (ii) the price per share in the purported transfer or original issuance of shares, as described in the preceding paragraph, or the market price per share on the date of the status change, that resulted in the transfer to the trust.\nAs a result of the above trust transfer provisions, a proposed transferee that is a non-U.S. citizen or a record or beneficial owner whose citizenship status change results in excess shares may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss.\nTo the extent that the above trust transfer provisions would be ineffective for any reason, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, if the percentage of the shares of any class or series of capital stock owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens is known to us to be in excess of 22% for such class or series, we, in our sole discretion, shall be entitled to redeem all or any portion of such shares most recently acquired (as determined by us in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), by non-U.S. citizens, or owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens as a result of a change in citizenship status, in excess of such permitted percentage for such class or series at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Such excess shares shall not be accorded any voting, dividend or distribution rights until they have ceased to be excess shares, provided that they have not been already redeemed by us. As a result of these provisions, a stockholder who is a non-U.S. citizen may be required to sell its shares of common stock at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on its investment in such shares. Further, we may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case our financial condition may be materially weakened.\nIn order to assist our compliance with the Jones Act, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to require that any record or beneficial owner of any shares of our capital stock provide us with certain documentation concerning such owner\u2019s citizenship. These provisions include a requirement that every person acquiring, directly or indirectly, five percent (5%) or more of the shares of any class or series of our capital stock must provide us with specified citizenship documentation. In the event that any person does not submit such requested or required documentation to us, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides us with certain remedies, including the suspension of the voting rights of the person\u2019s shares owned by persons unable or unwilling to submit such documentation and the payment of dividends and distributions with respect to those shares into a segregated account. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, a record or beneficial owner of the shares of our common stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the foregoing ownership restrictions on non-U.S. citizens could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nIf non-U.S. citizens own more than 22% of our common stock, we may not have the funds or the ability to redeem any excess shares and the charitable trust mechanism described above may be deemed invalid or unenforceable, all with the result that we could be forced to either suspend our operations in the U.S. coastwise trade or be subject to substantial penalties.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions voiding transfers of shares of any class or series of our capital stock that would result in non-U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, in the aggregate, owning in excess of 22% of the shares of such class or series. In the event that this transfer restriction would be ineffective, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the automatic transfer of such excess shares to a trust specified therein. These trust provisions also apply to excess shares that would result from a change in the status of a record or beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock from a U.S. citizen to a non-U.S. citizen. In the event that these trust transfer provisions would also be ineffective, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to redeem such excess shares. The per-share redemption price may be paid, as determined by our Board of Directors, by cash or redemption notes or the shares may be redeemed for warrants. However, we may not be able to redeem such excess shares for cash because our operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such redemption. Further, the methodology for transfer to and sale by a charitable trust could be deemed invalid or unenforceable in one or more jurisdictions. If, for any reason, we are unable to effect a redemption or charitable sale when beneficial ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens is in excess of 24.99% of the common stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate from beneficially owning shares in excess of 24.99% of any class or series of capital stock, or fail to exercise our redemption or forced sale rights because we are unaware that ownership exceeds such percentage, we will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend our operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. Any such actions by governmental authorities would have a severely detrimental impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and any failure to suspend operations in violation of the Jones Act could cause us to be subject to material financial and operational penalties.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d). We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nOur outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of common stock.\nAs of March 2, 2017, we had issued and outstanding warrants to purchase 10,673,015 shares of common stock. The sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nWe may redeem the warrants at a time that is not beneficial to public investors.\nWe may call the public warrants for redemption at any time after the redemption criteria described in the prospectus for our initial public offering have been satisfied. If we call the public warrants for redemption, public stockholders may be forced to accept a nominal redemption price or sell or exercise the warrants when they may not wish to do so.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described in the prospectus for our initial public offering have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant (including any warrants held by our initial stockholders or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nWe do not intend to pay any dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our shares of common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial conditions. The payment of any dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors. It is the present intention of our Board of Directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our Board of Directors does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, any gain you will realize on our securities will result solely from the appreciation of such securities.", "PERMNO": 14045, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "LIND"}
