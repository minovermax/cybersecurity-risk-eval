{"cik": "716634", "company": "READING INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Set forth below is a summary of various risk factors that you should consider in connection with your investment in our company. This summary should be considered in the context of our overall Annual Report on Form 10K, as many of the topics addressed below are discussed in significantly greater detail in the context of specific discussions of our business plan, our operating results, and the various competitive forces that we face.\nBusiness Risk Factors\nWe are currently engaged principally in the cinema exhibition and real estate businesses. Since we operate in two business segments (cinema exhibition and real estate), we discuss separately below the risks we believe to be material to our involvement in each of these segments. We have discussed separately certain risks relating to the international nature of our business activities, our use of leverage, and our status as a controlled corporation. Please note, that while we report the results of our live theater operations as real estate operations - since we are principally in the business of renting space to producers rather than in licensing or producing plays ourselves - the cinema exhibition and live theater businesses share certain risk factors and are, accordingly, discussed together below.\nCinema Exhibition and Live Theater Business Risk Factors\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment with many competitors who are significantly larger and may have significantly better access to funds than do we.\nWe are a comparatively small cinema operator and face competition from much larger cinema exhibitors. These larger exhibitors are able to offer distributors more screens in more markets - including markets where they may be the exclusive exhibitor - than can we. In some cases, faced with such competition, we may not be able to get access to all of the films we want, which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nThese larger competitors may also enjoy (i) greater cash flow, which can be used to develop additional cinemas, including cinemas that may be competitive with our existing cinemas, (ii) better access to equity capital and debt, and (iii) better visibility to landlords and real estate developers, than do we.\nIn the case of our live theaters, we compete for shows not only with other \u201cfor profit\u201d off-Broadway theaters, but also with not-for-profit operators and, increasingly, with Broadway theaters. We believe our live theaters are generally competitive with other off-Broadway venues. However, due to the increased cost of staging live theater productions, we are seeing an increasing tendency for plays that would historically have been staged in an off-Broadway theater, moving directly to larger Broadway venues.\nWe face competition from other sources of entertainment and other entertainment delivery systems.\nBoth our cinema and live theater operations face competition from developing \u201cin-home\u201d sources of entertainment. These include competition from cable and satellite television, Video on Demand (\u201cVOD\u201d), DVD, the internet and other sources of entertainment, and video games. The quality of in-house entertainment systems, as well as programming available on an in-home basis has increased, while the cost to consumers of such systems (and such programming) has decreased in recent periods, and some consumers may prefer the security of an \u201din-home\u201d entertainment experience to the more public experience offered by our cinemas and live theaters. Film distributors have been responding to these developments by, in some cases, decreasing or eliminating the period of time between cinema release and the date such product is made available to \u201cin-home\u201d forms of distribution.\nThe narrowing and/or elimination of this so-called \u201cwindow\u201d for cinema exhibition may be problematic for the cinema exhibition industry. However, to date, indications by the major film distributors to continue to narrow or eliminate the window have been strenuously resisted by the cinema exhibition industry and we view the total elimination of the cinema exhibition window by major film distributors, while theoretically possible, to be unlikely.\nHowever, there is the risk that, over time, distributors may move towards simultaneous release of motion picture product in multiple channels of distribution. Also, some traditional in-home distributors have begun the production of full-length movies, specifically for the purpose of direct or simultaneous release to the in-home market. These factors may adversely affect the competitive advantage enjoyed by cinemas over \u201cin-home\u201d forms of entertainment, as it may be that both the cinema market and the \u201cin-home\u201d market will have simultaneous access to the same motion picture product. In 2014, a number of movies were released on a simultaneous basis to movie\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nexhibitors and to in-home markets. It is likely that this trend will continue, making it increasingly important for exhibitors to enhance the convenience and quality of the theater-going experience.\nWe also face competition from various other forms of \u201cbeyond-the-home\u201d entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, restaurants, casinos, video game arcades, and nightclubs. Our cinemas also face competition from live theaters and vice versa.\nOur cinema operations depend upon access to film that is attractive to our patrons and our live theater operations depend upon the continued attractiveness of our theaters to producers.\nOur ability to generate revenue and profits is largely dependent on factors outside of our control, specifically, the continued ability of motion picture and live theater producers to produce films and plays that are attractive to audiences, the amount of money spent by film distributors to promote their motion pictures, and the willingness of these producers to license their films on terms that are financially viable to our cinemas and to rent our theaters for the presentation of their plays. To the extent that popular movies and plays are produced, our cinema and live theater activities are ultimately dependent upon our ability, in the face of competition from other cinema and live theater operators, to book these movies and plays into our facilities, and to provide a superior customer offering.\nWe rely on film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres. In the U.S., the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with seven major film distributors accounting for approximately 89.1% of U.S. box office revenues. Numerous antitrust cases and the consent decree resulting from these antitrust cases affect the distribution of films. The consent decree binds major film distributors to license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors. We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre. A deterioration in our relationship with any of the seven major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAdverse economic conditions could materially affect our business by reducing discretionary income and by limiting or reducing sources of film and live theater funding.\nCinema and live theater attendance is a luxury, not a necessity. Accordingly, a decline in the economy resulting in a decrease in discretionary income, or a perception of such a decline, may result in decreased discretionary spending, which could adversely affect our cinema and live theater businesses. Adverse economic conditions can also affect the supply side of our business, as reduced liquidity can adversely affect the availability of funding for movies and plays. This is particularly true in the case of Off-Broadway plays, which are often times financed by high net worth individuals (or groups of such individuals) and that are very risky due to the absence of any ability to recoup investment in secondary markets like DVD, cable, satellite or internet distribution.\nOur screen advertising revenue may decline.\nOver the past several years, cinema exhibitors have been looking increasingly to screen advertising as a way to boost income. No assurances can be given that this source of income will be continuing or that the use of such advertising will not ultimately prove to be counterproductive by giving consumers a disincentive to choose going to the movies over \u201cin-home\u201d entertainment alternatives.\nWe face uncertainty as to the timing and direction of technological innovations in the cinema exhibition business and as to our access to those technologies.\nWe have converted all of our cinema auditoriums to digital projection. However, no assurances can be given that other technological advances will not require us to make further material investments in our cinemas or face loss of business. Also, equipment is currently being developed for holographic or laser projection. The future of these technologies in the cinema exhibition industry is uncertain.\nWe face competition from new competitors offering food and beverage as an integral part of their cinema offerings.\nA number of new entrants, such as Alamo Drafthouse, offering an expanded food and beverage menu (including the sale of alcoholic beverages) have emerged in recent periods. In addition, some competitors are converting existing cinemas to provide such expanded menu offerings. The existence of such cinemas may alter\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntraditional cinema selection practices of moviegoers, as they seek out cinemas with such expanded offerings as a preferred alternative to traditional cinemas.\nReal Estate Development and Ownership Business Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, in which we must compete against companies with much greater financial and human resources than we have.\nWe have limited financial and human resources, compared to our principal real estate competitors. In recent periods, we have relied heavily on outside professionals in connection with our real estate development activities. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale than we can.\nRisks Related to the Real Estate Industry Generally\nOur financial performance will be affected by risks associated with the real estate industry generally.\nEvents and conditions generally applicable to developers, owners, and operators of real property will affect our performance as well. These include (i) changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, (ii) local conditions such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand, for commercial space and/or entertainment-oriented properties, (iii) reduced attractiveness of our properties to tenants, (iv) the rental rates and capitalization rates applicable to the markets in which we operate and the quality of properties that we own, (v) competition from other properties, (vi) inability to collect rent from tenants, (vii) increased operating costs, including labor, materials, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and utilities, (viii) costs of complying with changes in government regulations, (ix) the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, and (x) decreases in sources of both construction and long-term lending as traditional sources of such funding leave or reduce their commitments to real estate-based lending. In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in declining rents or increased lease defaults.\nWe may incur costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar statutory regimes in Australia and New Zealand or under applicable state or local law, all places of public accommodation (including cinemas and theaters) are required to meet certain governmental requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. A determination that we are not in compliance with those governmental requirements with respect to any of our properties could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The cost of addressing these issues could be substantial.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Many of our properties are either (i) \u201cspecial purpose\u201d properties that could not be readily converted to general residential, retail or office use, or (ii) undeveloped land. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment and competitive factors may prevent the pass-through of such costs to tenants.\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks.\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nThe identification and acquisition of suitable development properties. Competition for suitable development properties is intense. Our ability to identify and acquire development properties may be limited by our size and resources. Also, as we and our affiliates are considered to be \u201cforeign owned\u201d for purposes of certain Australian and New Zealand statutes, we have been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to regulations that are not applicable to other persons doing business in those countries.\n\u00b7\nThe procurement of necessary land use entitlements for the project. This process can take many years, particularly if opposed by competing interests. Competitors and community groups (sometimes funded by such competitors) may object based on various factors, including, for example, impacts on density,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nparking, traffic, noise levels and the historic or architectural nature of the building being replaced. If they are unsuccessful at the local governmental level, they may seek recourse to the courts or other tribunals. This can delay projects and increase costs.\n\u00b7\nThe construction of the project on time and on budget. Construction risks include the availability and cost of finance; the availability and costs of material and labor; the costs of dealing with unknown site conditions (including addressing pollution or environmental wastes deposited upon the property by prior owners); inclement weather conditions; and the ever-present potential for labor-related disruptions.\n\u00b7\nThe leasing or sell-out of the project. Ultimately, there are risks involved in the leasing of a rental property or the sale of a condominium or built-for-sale property. For our entertainment-themed retail centers (\u201cETRCs\u201d), the extent to which our cinemas can continue to serve as an anchor tenant will be influenced by the same factors as will influence generally the results of our cinema operations. Leasing or sale can be influenced by economic factors that are neither known nor knowable at the commencement of the development process and by local, national, and even international economic conditions, both real and perceived.\n\u00b7\nThe refinancing of completed properties. Properties are often developed using relatively short-term loans. Upon completion of the project, it may be necessary to find replacement financing for these loans. This process involves risk as to the availability of such permanent or other take-out financing, the interest rates, and the payment terms applicable to such financing, which may be adversely influenced by local, national, or international factors. To date, we have been successful in negotiating development loans with \u201croll over\u201d or other provisions mitigating our need to refinance immediately upon completion of construction.\nThe ownership of properties involves risk.\nThe ownership of investment properties involves risks, such as: (i) ongoing leasing and re-leasing risks, (ii) ongoing financing and re-financing risks, (iii) market risks as to the multiples offered by buyers of investment properties, (iv) risks related to the ongoing compliance with changing governmental regulation (including, without limitation, environmental laws and requirements to remediate environmental contamination that may exist on a property (such as, by way of example, asbestos), even though not deposited on the property by us), (v) relative illiquidity compared to some other types of assets, and (vi) susceptibility of assets to uninsurable risks, such as biological, chemical or nuclear terrorism, or risks that are subject to caps tied to the concentration of such assets in certain geographic areas, such as earthquakes. Furthermore, as our properties are typically developed around an entertainment use, the attractiveness of these properties to tenants, sources of finance and real estate investors will be influenced by market perceptions of the benefits and detriments of such entertainment type properties.\nA number of our assets are in geologically active areas, presenting risk of earthquake and land movement.\nWe have cinemas in California and New Zealand, areas which present a greater risk of earthquake and/or land movement than other locations. New Zealand has in recent periods had several major earthquakes damaging our facilities in Christchurch and Wellington. The ability to insure for such casualties is limited and may become more difficult and/or more expensive in future periods.\nInternational Business Risks\nOur international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including the following:\nRisk of currency fluctuations. While we report our earnings and assets in US dollars, substantial portions of our revenue and of our obligations are denominated in either Australian or New Zealand dollars. The value of these currencies can vary significantly compared to the US dollar and compared to each other. We typically have not hedged against these currency fluctuations, but rather have relied upon the natural hedges that exist as a result of the fact that our film costs are typically fixed as a percentage of the box office, and our local operating costs and obligations are likewise typically denominated in local currencies. However, we do have debt at our parent company level that is serviced by our overseas cash flow and our ability to service this debt could be adversely impacted by declines in the relative value of the Australian and New Zealand dollar compared to the US dollar. $32.4 million (AUS$39.6 million) of our Australian cash and $7.7 million (NZ$9.9 million) of our New Zealand cash is denominated in local currencies and subject to the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Also, our use of local borrowings to mitigate the business risk of currency fluctuations has reduced our flexibility to move cash between jurisdictions. Set forth below is a chart of the exchange ratios between these three currencies over the past twenty years:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nRisk of adverse government regulation. At the present time, we believe that relations between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are good. However, no assurances can be given that this relationship will continue and that Australia and New Zealand will not in the future seek to regulate more highly the business done by US companies in their countries.\n\u00b7\nRisk of adverse labor relations. Any deterioration in labor relations could lead to an increased cost of labor (including future government requirements with respect to pension liabilities, disability insurance and health coverage, and vacations and leave).\nRisks Associated with Certain Discontinued Operations\nCertain of our subsidiaries were previously in industrial businesses. As a consequence, properties that are currently owned or may have in the past been owned by these subsidiaries may prove to have environmental issues. Where we have knowledge of such environmental issues and are in a position to make an assessment as to our exposure, we have established what we believe to be appropriate reserves, but we are exposed to the risk that currently unknown problems may be discovered. These subsidiaries are also exposed to potential claims related to exposure of former employees to coal dust, asbestos, and other materials now considered to be, or which in the future may be found to be, carcinogenic or otherwise injurious to health.\nOperating Results, Financial Structure and Borrowing Risk\nFrom time to time, we may have negative working capital.\nIn recent years, as we have invested our cash in new acquisitions and the development of our existing properties, we have from time-to-time had negative working capital. This negative working capital is typical in the cinema exhibition industry because our short-term liabilities are in part financing our long-term assets instead of long-term liabilities financing short-term assets as is the case in other industries such as manufacturing and distribution.\nWe have substantial short to medium term debt.\nGenerally speaking, we have historically financed our operations through relatively short-term debt. No assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance this debt, or if we can, that the terms will be reasonable.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nHowever, as a counterbalance to this debt, we have significant unencumbered real property assets, which could be sold to pay debt or encumbered to assist in the refinancing of existing debt, if necessary.\nIn February 2007, we issued $50.0 million in 20-year Trust Preferred Securities (\u201cTPS\u201d), and utilized the net proceeds principally to retire short-term bank debt in New Zealand and Australia. The interest rate on our TPS was only fixed for five years. Additionally, we used US dollar denominated obligations to retire debt denominated in New Zealand and Australian dollars, which has increased our exposure to currency risk. In the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased $22.9 million of our TPS at a 50% discount.\nAt the present time, corporate borrowers both domestically and internationally are facing greater than normal constraints on liquidity. No assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance these debts as they become due.\nWe have substantial lease liabilities.\nMost of our cinemas operate in leased facilities. These leases typically have \u201ccost of living\u201d or other rent adjustment features and require that we operate the properties as cinemas. A downturn in our cinema exhibition business might, depending on its severity, adversely affect the ability of our cinema operating subsidiaries to meet these rental obligations. Even if our cinema exhibition business remains relatively constant, cinema level cash flow will likely be adversely affected unless we can increase our revenue sufficiently to offset increases in our rental liabilities. Unlike property rental leases, our newly added digital equipment leases do not have \u201ccost of living\u201d or other lease adjustment features.\nOur stock is thinly traded.\nOur stock is thinly traded, with an average daily volume in 2014 of only approximately 56,000 shares. This can result in significant volatility, as demand by buyers and sellers can easily get out of balance.\nOwnership and Management Structure, Corporate Governance, and Change of Control Risks\nPending disputes among the Cotter family raise uncertainty regarding control of our company, and may distract the time and attention of our officers and directors from our business and operations or interfere with the effective management of our company.\nAs we have previously reported, the Reading Voting Trust established by James J. Cotter, Sr., our deceased former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and former controlling stockholder, holds at least 696,080 shares of our Class B Voting Stock (\u201cVoting Stock\u201d) constituting approximately 46.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. The Reading Voting Trust also may hold an additional 327,808 shares of Voting Stock, constituting approximately 21.9% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, based upon an assignment of such shares purportedly executed by Mr. Cotter, Sr., prior to this death. We are informed that, in the event these shares were not effectively transferred to the Reading Voting Trust, they would eventually pour over into the Trust. In the meantime, however, they may instead make up part of the Estate of James J. Cotter, Deceased (the \u201cEstate\u201d and collectively with the Reading Voting Trust and the James J. Cotter Living Trust, the \u201cCotter Estate\u201d) that is being administered in the State of Nevada. On December 22, 2014, the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, appointed Ellen Cotter, the Chair of our Board of Directors and our Chief Operating Officer- Domestic Cinemas and Margaret Cotter, Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors, as co-executors of the Estate.\nA 2013 amended and restated declaration of trust names Margaret Cotter as the sole trustee of the Reading Voting Trust and names James J. Cotter, Jr., our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of our company, as the first alternate trustee in the event that Margaret Cotter is unable or unwilling to act as trustee. A 2014 partial amendment to the declaration of trust, however, names Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter, Jr. as co-trustees of the Reading Voting Trust and provides that, in the event they are unable to agree upon an important trust decision, they shall rotate the trusteeship between them annually on each January 1st. It further directs the trustees of the Reading Voting Trust to, among other things, vote such shares of our Voting Stock held by the Reading Voting Trust in favor of the election of Ellen Cotter, Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter, Jr. to our board of directors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOn February 6, 2015, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter filed a Petition in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, captioned In re James J. Cotter Living Trust dated August 1, 2000 (Case No. BP159755). The Petition, among other things, seeks relief that could determine the validity of the 2014 partial amendment and who, as between Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter Jr., has authority as trustee or co-trustees of the Reading Voting Trust to vote the Reading Voting Trust\u2019s shares of our Voting Stock (in whole or in part) and the scope and extent of such authority. James J. Cotter, Jr. has advised us that he intends to file an opposition to the Petition.\nAlthough the company is not a party to this lawsuit and takes no position as to the claims asserted or the relief sought therein, the matters raised in the Petition create uncertainty regarding control of our company. Until these matters can be resolved, it is unclear whether the Reading Voting Trust owns a majority of our outstanding shares of Voting Stock and, as such, can determine the outcome of the election of directors of our company and of any other matters that may be presented for approval by our stockholders. It also is unclear whether Margaret Cotter, or she and James J. Cotter, Jr., together, has authority as trustee or co-trustees of the Reading Voting Trust to vote the shares of our Voting Stock currently held by the Reading Voting Trust or any additional shares of our Voting Stock that may be determined to be held by the Reading Voting Trust instead of the Estate.\nThese pending matters may distract the Cotter family\u2019s time and attention from the business and operations of our Company and thus have an adverse effect on its effective management.\nThe interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Cotter Estate beneficially owns 70.4% of our outstanding Class B Stock. Our Class A Stock is non-voting, while our Class B Stock represents all of the voting power of our Company. For as long as the Cotter Estate continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock. The Cotter Estate will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on common stock. The Cotter Estate will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to the Cotter Estate but not to other stockholders. In addition, the Cotter Estate and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries. In the future, we may participate in transactions with these companies (see Note 25 - Related Parties and Transactions to our 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements).\nSince we are a Controlled Company, our Directors have determined to take advantage of certain exemptions provide by the NASDAQ from the corporate governance rules adopted by that Exchange.\nGenerally speaking, the NASDAQ requires listed companies to meet certain minimum corporate governance provisions. However, a \u201cControlled Corporation\u201d, such as we, may elect not to be governed by certain of these provisions. Our board of directors has elected to exempt our Company from requirements that (i) at least a majority of our directors be independent, (ii) nominees to our board of directors be nominated by a committee comprised entirely of independent directors or by a majority of our Company\u2019s independent directors, and (iii) the compensation of our chief executive officer be determined or recommended to our board of directors by a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors or by a majority of our Company\u2019s independent directors. Notwithstanding the determination by our board of directors to opt-out of these NASDAQ requirements, a majority of our board of directors is nevertheless currently comprised of independent directors, and our compensation committee is nevertheless currently comprised entirely of independent directors.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly harm us. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.", "PERMNO": 87533, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "RDI"}
