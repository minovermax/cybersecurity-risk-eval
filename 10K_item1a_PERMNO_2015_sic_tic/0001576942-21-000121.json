You may lose all or part of your investment.\n\u2022Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022The dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, and may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\u2022We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation of the value of our Class A common stock.\n\u2022Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\u2022Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our reported financial information and this may lead to a decline in our stock price.\n\u2022We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available or may be available only by diluting existing stockholders.\n\u2022If securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\n\u2022Future securities sales and issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and impair the market price of our Class A common stock.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \u201cAnnual Report\u201d), and in our other public filings. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to our operations and impacted our business, key financial and operating metrics, and results of operations in numerous ways that remain unpredictable.\nOur business has been and may continue to be materially impacted by the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic and related measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as government-mandated business closures, office closures, state and local orders to \u201cshelter in place,\u201d and travel and transportation restrictions, have negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, and led to unprecedented levels of unemployment.\nThere continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its impact on U.S. and global economic activity and consumer behavior. The Delta variant of COVID-19, which appears to be the most transmissible and contagious variant to date, has caused a surge in COVID-19 cases globally. The impact of the Delta variant, or other variants that may emerge, cannot be predicted at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including the availability of vaccines in different parts of the world, vaccination rates among the population, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta variant and other variants, and the response by governmental bodies to reinstate mandated business closures, orders to \u201cshelter in place,\u201d and travel and transportation restrictions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related measures have resulted in significant disruption that has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our business, including our operational capacity and results of operations. While all of our fulfillment centers are currently open, we experienced temporary closures and reduced capacity in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 as we temporarily closed three of our fulfillment centers as we responded to the pandemic. We allowed employees to opt-in to work, provided them with four weeks of flexible paid time off, and implemented additional safety protocols. These efforts resulted in significantly less capacity in our fulfillment centers during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, which resulted in delayed Fix shipments, a significant Fix backlog, delayed inventory and return processing, extended wait times for clients, and inventory management challenges. While we have only experienced intermittent and temporary closures since the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we have recently begun to experience an increase of COVID-19 cases in our fulfillment centers in connection with the surge of cases caused by the Delta variant. This recent increase in cases has negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, operations at our fulfillment centers. Additionally, we have experienced difficulty hiring employees in our fulfillment centers, which we attribute to COVID-19 concerns and to increased competition and rising wages for eCommerce fulfillment center workers as eCommerce demand accelerates. Capacity constraints in our fulfillment centers could cause delayed Fix shipments, delayed inventory and return processing, and inventory management challenges.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, at times, negatively impacted our results of operations, and the future impact and duration of this impact remain uncertain. It will depend on factors such as the length of time the pandemic continues; the efficacy and availability of the COVID-19 vaccines; the impact of the Delta variant and the duration of the surge in cases related thereto; the emergence of additional variants; how national, state and local governments continue to respond; the impact of the crisis on the economy and consumer behavior; and the effect on our clients, employees, vendors, and other partners. For example, we continue to work with our vendors to minimize inventory disruptions, but future delays and supply constraints may negatively affect our ability to obtain and manage inventory. We have experienced shipping delays to and from our customers as a result of our shipping vendors' challenges fulfilling higher eCommerce shipping demand, which has impacted our results of operations. We also have been affected by, and expect to continue to be affected by, COVID-related freight delays and difficulties sourcing materials. Additionally, we may be negatively impacted if consumers shift back to traditional brick-and-mortar apparel retailers following the pandemic.\nOur corporate headquarters remains closed to the majority of employees. While we expect many employees to return to our office later this fiscal year, the expected timing of such a return has been affected by the Delta variant and related surge in Covid cases and could be further delayed by this resurgence of COVID-19 or additional resurgences. Additionally, when we return to our office, we expect many employees to continue to work in a remote capacity or a hybrid of in-person and remote work. These changes to our operations going forward present additional risks, uncertainties and costs that could affect our performance, including increased operational risk, uncertainty regarding office space needs, heightened vulnerability to cyber attacks due to increased remote work, potential reduced productivity, changes to our Company culture, potential strains to our business continuity plans, and increased costs to insure our offices are safe and functional as hybrid offices that enable effective collaboration of both remote and in-person colleagues.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets. And while we have taken measures to preserve our access to liquidity, our cash generated from operations has been negatively impacted and future cash flows may be impacted by the development of the pandemic.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material effect on us. Though we continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic closely, the situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. In addition, if there are future resurgences of COVID-19, including of new strains or variants, the negative impacts on our business may be exacerbated.\nOur failure to adequately and effectively staff our fulfillment centers, through third parties or with our own employees, and other operational constraints at our fulfillment centers could adversely affect our client experience and operating results.\nWe currently receive and distribute merchandise at six fulfillment centers in the United States. We are in the process of building out another fulfillment center in the United States and we closed our South San Francisco fulfillment center in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. We also have a fulfillment center in the UK, which is operated by a third party. During the third quarter of our 2020 fiscal year, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed three of our fulfillment centers, offered our fulfillment center employees four weeks of paid time off, and reduced the maximum number of employees in each fulfillment center in order to implement social distancing protocols. These changes resulted in operational constraints, which in turn temporarily reduced our ability to ship merchandise to clients and earn revenue during the third quarter of our 2020 fiscal year. Since the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we have experienced smaller, intermittent interruptions in connection with temporary closures of fulfillment centers. We have recently also begun to experience an increase of COVID-19 cases in our fulfillment centers in connection with the surge of cases caused by the Delta variant, which has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect capacity at our fulfillment centers.\nAdditionally, we have experienced difficulty hiring employees in our fulfillment centers, which we attribute to COVID-19 concerns and to increased competition and rising wages for eCommerce fulfillment center workers as eCommerce demand accelerates. To address this, we have increased wages in our fulfillment centers and implemented other policies in order to be more competitive in hiring employees. These wage increases impacted our operating results. We are likely to continue to have difficulty hiring employees in fulfillment centers due to increased competition and we expect to continue to increase wages for our fulfillment center employees, as necessary, which would impact our operating results. These hiring difficulties, and our closure of one fulfillment center while in the process of building out a new one which is not yet operational, have caused and may in the future cause additional capacity constraints in our fulfillment centers. Capacity constraints in our fulfillment centers could affect the amount and types of inventory we have available to offer to clients, which will affect our results of operations. Surges in COVID-19 cases among fulfillment center employees could also affect the capacity of our fulfillment centers, and therefore our operating results. Additionally, if we or our third-party partner are unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers to meet demand, or if the cost of such staffing is higher than projected due to competition, mandated wage increases, regulatory changes, international expansion, or other factors, our operating results will be further harmed.\nSevere weather events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, storms, and other adverse weather events and climate conditions could also cause operational constraints or temporarily reduce our ability to ship merchandise to clients. For instance, the severe winter weather and temperatures experienced in Texas and other parts of the country in February 2021 caused us to temporarily close two of our fulfillment centers and affected the shipping of merchandise in and out of fulfillment centers. Future weather events, which we expect to become more frequent and more severe with the increasing effects of climate change, could have a significant impact on our operations and results of operations.\nIn addition, operating fulfillment centers comes with potential risks, such as workplace safety issues and employment claims for the failure or alleged failure to comply with labor laws or laws respecting union organizing activities. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with wage and hour laws for our nonexempt employees, many of whom work in our fulfillment centers, we could be subject to legal risk, including claims for back wages, unpaid overtime pay, and missed meal and rest periods, which could be on a class or representative basis. Any such issues may result in delays in shipping times, reduced packing quality, or costly litigation, and our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nFinally, by using a third-party operator for one of our fulfillment centers, we also face additional risks associated with not having complete control over operations at our UK fulfillment center. Any deterioration in the financial condition or operations of that third party, or the loss of the relationship with that third party, or any event or crisis that impacts the UK generally or the specific area where our fulfillment center is located, would have a significant impact on our operations.\nIf we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nTo ensure timely delivery of merchandise, we generally enter into purchase contracts well in advance of a particular season and often before apparel trends are confirmed by client purchases. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. For example, in response to the initial consumer reaction to COVID-19, we cancelled many inventory orders to be prepared for what we expected would be lower client demand. Consequently, when client demand increased, our inventory was not as optimized to meet the demand as we would have liked. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to rapidly shift elements of our inventory away from office attire and towards athleisure to accommodate consumer demand changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the surge in the Delta variant of COVID-19 has impacted some of our vendors, who have had delays in producing our orders. Shipping and freight delays have also been increasing as port closures, port congestion, and shipping container and ship shortages have increased over the last several months. Our inventory levels also may be affected by product launch delays, demand fluctuations, and our inability to predict demand with respect to new categories or products. In the past, we have not always predicted our clients\u2019 preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy, which has resulted in significant inventory write offs and lower gross margins. Furthermore, we do not use the same liquidation methods as traditional retailers, such as markdowns. We rely on our merchandising team to order styles and products that our clients will purchase and we rely on our data science to inform the depth and breadth of inventory we purchase, including when to reorder items that are selling well and when to write off items that are not selling well. If our merchandise team does not predict client demand and tastes well or if our algorithms do not help us reorder the right products or write off the right products in a timely manner, we may not effectively manage our inventory and we may experience future significant inventory write-offs, which will adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, we have experienced challenges managing our inventory within the fulfillment centers given storage capacity constraints and challenges hiring fulfillment center employees. These constraints have affected, and may continue to affect, the amount and types of inventory we have available to offer to clients, which could affect our operating results.\nShipping is a critical part of our business and any changes in our shipping arrangements or any interruptions in shipping could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe currently rely on three major vendors for our shipping. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these entities, shipping prices increase at unexpected levels, or our vendors experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and our clients experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently, ship merchandise to clients, and receive returned merchandise from clients may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, public health crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, and similar factors. Due to our business model and the fact that we recognize revenue from Fixes when a client checks out items, rather than when Fixes are shipped, we may be impacted by shipping delays to a greater extent than our competitors. Additionally, delays in shipping may cause an auto-ship client\u2019s subsequent Fixes to be scheduled for a later date, as their next Fix is not scheduled until their checkout is complete. In the second quarter of our 2021 fiscal year, we experienced carrier and client shipping delays due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the increased strain on our shipping partners during the holiday season. These delays affected our ability to recognize revenue within the quarter, and we may in the future experience these delays and the resulting impact to our financial results, including potentially during future holiday seasons. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed three of our fulfillment centers during the third quarter of our 2020 fiscal year, offered our fulfillment center employees four weeks of paid time off, implemented social distancing protocols in each fulfillment center, and periodically closed fulfillment centers for part of a work day or a full work day, all of which resulted in operational constraints, which in turn reduced our ability to ship merchandise to clients and earn revenue. With the emergence of the Delta variant and related surge in COVID-19 cases, we are experiencing an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among fulfillment center employees, which is affecting the capacity of our fulfillment centers and is likely to continue to do so. In the past, strikes at major international shipping ports have impacted our supply of inventory from our vendors and severe weather events have resulted in long delivery delays and Fix cancellations. Some of our merchandise may be damaged or lost during transit with our shipping vendors. If a greater portion of our merchandise is not delivered in a timely fashion or is damaged or lost during transit, it could adversely affect our operating results or could cause our clients to become dissatisfied and cease using our services, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with sourcing of merchandise and raw materials and manufacturing.\nWe currently source nearly all of the merchandise that we offer from third-party vendors, many of whom use manufacturers in the same geographic region, and as a result we may be subject to price increases or fluctuations, tariffs, demand disruptions, increased shipping or freight costs, or shipping delays in connection with our merchandise. Our operating results would be negatively impacted by increases in the cost of our merchandise, and we have no guarantees that costs will not rise. In addition, as we expand into new categories, product types, and geographies, we expect that we may not have strong purchasing power in these new areas, which could lead to higher costs than we have historically seen in our current categories. We may not be able to pass increased costs on to clients, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe fabrics used by our vendors are made of raw materials including, but not limited to, petroleum-based products and cotton. Significant price increases or fluctuations, currency volatility or fluctuation, tariffs, shortages, increases in shipping or freight costs, or shipping delays of petroleum, cotton, or other raw materials could significantly increase our cost of goods sold or affect our operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic caused delays in some shipments from our suppliers, and as the Delta variant causes a resurgence of COVID-19, we are starting to again experience delays in some shipments from our suppliers caused by factory and port closures, port congestion, and shipping container and other shortages. Additionally, we have limited visibility into delays or control over shipping. We expect these delays to continue as long as COVID-19 continues to affect geographies around the world. We are also experiencing increased costs of goods, due to these freight challenges, increases in the price of raw materials, and currency volatility, and we expect that prices may continue to increase in the near future.\nOther factors such as natural disasters have in the past increased raw material costs, impacted pricing with certain of our vendors, and caused shipping delays for certain of our merchandise. Also, the U.S. government\u2019s recent ban on cotton imported from the Xinjiang region of China, the source of a large portion of the world\u2019s cotton supply, may impact prices and the availability of cotton for our merchandise. Additionally, our products and materials (including potentially non-cotton materials) could be held for inspection by the United States Customs & Border Patrol (the \u201cUS CBP\u201d), which would cause delays and unexpectedly affect our inventory levels. In addition, the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. In the event of a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacture of the merchandise we offer, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, damage to, or increased costs in raw materials or the manufacture of the merchandise we offer could result in higher prices to acquire the merchandise, or non-delivery of merchandise altogether, and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee that merchandise we receive from vendors will be of sufficient quality or free from damage, or that such merchandise will not be damaged during shipping, while stored in one of our fulfillment centers, or when returned by customers. While we take measures to ensure merchandise quality and avoid damage, including evaluating vendor product samples, conducting inventory inspections, and inspecting returned product, we cannot control merchandise while it is out of our possession or prevent all damage while in our fulfillment centers. We may incur additional expenses and our reputation could be harmed if clients and potential clients believe that our merchandise is not of high quality or may be damaged.\nWe have a short operating history in an evolving industry and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.\nWe have a short operating history in a rapidly evolving industry that may not develop in a manner favorable to our business. Our relatively short operating history makes it difficult to assess our future performance. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter.\nOur future success will depend in large part upon our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022cost-effectively acquire new clients and engage with existing clients;\n\u2022overcome the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022adequately and effectively staff our fulfillment centers;\n\u2022manage our inventory effectively;\n\u2022increase our market share;\n\u2022increase consumer awareness of our brand and maintain our reputation;\n\u2022anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes;\n\u2022successfully expand our offering and geographic reach;\n\u2022anticipate and respond to changing style trends and consumer preferences;\n\u2022compete effectively;\n\u2022avoid interruptions in our business from information technology downtime, cybersecurity breaches, or labor stoppages;\n\u2022effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022continue to enhance our personalization capabilities;\n\u2022hire, integrate, and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\n\u2022maintain the quality of our technology infrastructure;\n\u2022develop new features to enhance the client experience; and\n\u2022retain our existing merchandise vendors and attract new vendors.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, our business and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.\nTo effectively manage our growth, we must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems, and expand, train, and manage our employee base. From inception to date, we have rapidly and significantly increased our employee headcount to support the growth of our business. We added a significant number of employees over the last several years and plan to continue to do so. To support continued growth, we must effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new employees while maintaining our corporate culture, which is made more challenging due to (i) the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required us to transition to a more remote working environment, and (ii) our expected future hybrid environment of in-person and remote work. The risks associated with a rapidly growing workforce will be particularly acute as we expand internationally, as we are less familiar with the labor markets outside of the United States, and if we choose to expand into new merchandise categories.\nWe are also required to manage numerous relationships with various vendors and other third parties. Further growth of our operations, vendor base, fulfillment centers, information technology systems, or internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. For example, in May 2019, we launched our service in the UK, which involves working with international vendors, establishing offices and fulfillment centers in the UK, and complying with UK and European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) laws and regulations. Additionally, we continue to introduce new offerings such as, Freestyle and Fix Preview, as well as new business initiatives and inventory models. The roll-out of these new offerings and initiatives require investments of time and resources and may require changes in our website, mobile apps, information technology systems or processes, which involves inherent risk. These initiatives and changes also may not be rolled out as timely or effectively as we expect or may not produce the results we intend. If new offerings and initiatives are delayed, it could affect our inventory levels. If we are unable to manage the growth of our organization effectively, or if growth initiatives are not introduced timely or do not produce the anticipated results, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends on attracting new clients.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract new clients in a cost-effective manner. To expand our client base, we must appeal to and acquire clients who have historically used other means to purchase apparel, shoes, and accessories, such as traditional brick-and-mortar apparel retailers or the websites of our competitors. We also face competition for clients from other retailers who offer or plan to offer similar services as ours. We reach new clients through paid marketing, referral programs, organic word of mouth, and other methods of discovery, such as mentions in the press or internet search engine results. Although we have reduced our marketing spend at times, we expect to continue to increase our marketing spend, which may include increased spending on digital, television, radio and other paid marketing channels, and cannot be certain that these efforts will yield more clients, continue to achieve meaningful payback on our investments, or be as cost effective. Our marketing activity and spend may vary from period to period and we may adjust our marketing strategy or spend within a period if we are not achieving the intended results or if we believe the return-on-investment is not favorable, which may result in faster or slower rates of active client growth in any given period. For instance, while we expected to spend a certain amount on marketing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we experienced higher costs per acquisition than expected and, therefore, did not spend as much on marketing as anticipated. Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we did not spend as much on marketing as anticipated as we waited to launch Freestyle to new-to-Stitch Fix customers. Consequently, now that we have launched Freestyle in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we expect to increase marketing spend as we market this new offering. In addition, we seek to attract new clients by offering new products, services, and ways to engage with our platform, such as our Freestyle offering. If such new products or services are not timely launched or are not successful in attracting new clients, our revenue growth and results of operations may suffer. Moreover, new clients may not purchase from us as frequently or spend as much with us as existing clients, and the revenue generated from new clients may not be as high as the revenue generated from our existing clients. These factors may harm our growth prospects and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to maintain a high level of engagement with our clients and increase their spending with us, which could harm our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nA high proportion of our revenue comes from repeat purchases by existing clients, especially those existing clients who are highly engaged and purchase a significant amount of merchandise from us. The large majority of our clients choose to receive Fixes on a recurring basis, which we call \u201cauto-ship.\u201d In the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we saw a temporary increase in the rate of auto-ship cancellations. If the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact worsen or continue for longer than anticipated, auto-ship cancellations may increase again, negatively impacting our business.\nIf existing clients no longer find our service and merchandise appealing or appropriately priced, they may make fewer purchases and may stop using our service. Even if our existing clients continue to find our service and merchandise appealing, they may decide to receive fewer Fixes or purchase fewer items from their Fixes or through Freestyle over time as their demand for new apparel declines. For example, as a result of changes to daily life due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including increased rates of working remotely from home, many clients\u2019 demand for new apparel may be reduced or eliminated. In addition, as we expand our assortment to include more products with lower price points, the amount clients spend with us may decrease. If clients who receive Fixes most frequently or purchase a significant amount of merchandise from us were to make fewer or lower priced purchases or stop using our service, our financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, we seek to attract high-quality clients who will remain clients for the long term, but our efforts may not be successful or produce the results we anticipate. A decrease in the number of clients, a decrease in client spending on the merchandise we offer, or our inability to attract high-quality clients could negatively affect our operating results. Further, we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to increase sales to our existing clients over time and, if we are unable to do so, our business may suffer.\nWe expect to increase our paid marketing to help grow our business, but these efforts may not be successful or cost effective.\nPromoting awareness of our service is important to our ability to grow our business, drive client engagement, and attract new clients. We believe that much of the growth in our client base during our first five years originated from referrals, organic word of mouth, and other methods of discovery, as our marketing efforts and expenditures were relatively limited. In recent years, we increased our paid marketing initiatives and intend to continue to do so. Our marketing efforts currently include client referrals, affiliate programs, partnerships, display advertising, television, print, radio, video, content, direct mail, social media, email, mobile \u201cpush\u201d communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. External factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and decreased discretionary consumer spending, may impact the success of our marketing initiatives or how much we decide to spend on marketing in a given period. For example, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our marketing expenditures in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020. This led to fewer new clients being acquired in the third quarter, which we anticipate may impact demand for several subsequent quarters.\nOur marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult, such as the increased costs we have seen in certain digital marketing channels. We may also adjust our marketing activity from period to period or within a period as we launch new initiatives or offerings, such as Freestyle, run tests, or make decisions on marketing investments in response to anticipated rates of return, such as when we identify favorable cost per acquisition trends. For example, although we have historically reduced our advertising during the holiday season, when many other retailers compete for marketing opportunities, we had planned for more robust advertising during our second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2021. However, as we experienced higher costs per acquisition than we expected, we did not spend as much on marketing during the quarter as we anticipated. And in the fourth quarter 2021, we did not spend as much on marketing as anticipated as we waited to launch Freestyle to new-to-Stitch Fix customers, and expect to increase marketing spend in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 as we market this new offering. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the additional marketing expenses we incur.\nWe currently obtain a significant number of visits to our websites via organic search engine results. Search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user\u2019s search, which could reduce the number of organic visits to our websites, in turn reducing new client acquisition and adversely affecting our operating results.\nSocial networks are important as a source of new clients and as a means by which to connect with current clients, and their importance may be increasing. We may be unable to effectively maintain a presence within these networks, which could lead to lower than anticipated brand affinity and awareness, and in turn could adversely affect our operating results.\nFurther, mobile operating system and web browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced or recently implemented product changes to limit the ability of advertisers to collect and use data to target and measure advertising. For example, Apple recently made a change to iOS 14 to require apps to get a user\u2019s opt-in permission before tracking or sharing the user\u2019s data across apps or websites owned by companies other than the app\u2019s owner. Google intends to further restrict the use of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser in 2022, consistent with similar actions taken by the owners of other browsers, such as Apple in its Safari browser, and Mozilla in its Firefox browser. These changes are expected to reduce our ability to efficiently target and measure advertising, in particular through online social networks, making our advertising less cost effective and successful.\nWith respect to our email marketing efforts, if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our clients or if clients do not engage with our emails, whether out of choice, because those emails are marked as low priority or spam, or for other reasons, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new merchandise offerings or expand into new markets in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nThe largest portion of our revenue today comes from the sale of Women\u2019s apparel. From 2015 to 2018, we expanded our merchandise offering into categories including Petite, Maternity, Men\u2019s, Plus, Premium Brands, and Kids; began offering different product types including accessories and Extras; and expanded the number of brands we offer. In May 2019, we launched our service in the UK market. In June 2019, we introduced our direct-buy functionality (now called \u201cFreestyle\u201d) with Buy It Again allowing clients in the United States to buy previously purchased items in new colors, prints, and sizes. We expanded direct buy in February 2020, with Complete Your Looks, which allows clients to discover and shop personalized outfits with new items that complement their prior purchases. In addition, in early June 2020, we introduced Trending For You, which allows clients to shop personalized looks based on their style profiles. In May 2021, we introduced Categories, a new way for clients to easily discover pieces within a range of categories based on occasion, brand, or item type. And, in August 2021, we opened up Freestyle to new-to-Stitch Fix clients who have never received a Fix from us previously. We continue to explore additional offerings to serve our existing clients, attract new clients, and expand our geographic scope. Developing new offerings requires significant investments of resources and time, and if a new offering, such as Freestyle, does not appeal to new clients as we expect, our business may not grow as anticipated.\nNew offerings may not have the same success, or gain traction as quickly, as our current offerings. If the merchandise we offer is not accepted by our clients or does not attract new clients, or if we are not able to attract clients in new markets, our sales may fall short of expectations, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, and we may incur expenses that are not offset by sales. If the launch of a new category or offering or in a new geography requires investments greater than we expect or is delayed, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Also, our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract brands and other merchandise vendors that produce sufficient high-quality, appropriately priced, and on-trend merchandise. For example, vendors in the UK may not be familiar with our company or brand, which may make it difficult for us to obtain the merchandise we seek or be able to purchase products at an appropriate price.\nOur current merchandise offerings have a range of margin profiles and we believe new offerings will also have a broad range of margin profiles that will affect our operating results. New businesses generally contribute lower margins and imported merchandise may be subject to tariffs or duties that lower margins. Additionally, as we enter into new categories and markets, we may not have as high purchasing power as we do in our current offerings, which could increase our costs of goods sold and further reduce our margins. Expansion of our merchandise offerings and geographic scope may also strain our management and operational resources, specifically the need to hire and manage additional merchandise buyers to source new merchandise and to allocate new categories across our distribution network. We may also face greater competition in specific categories or regions from companies that are more focused on these areas. For example, now that we have launched in the UK, we compete with existing businesses that have been providing similar services in the region and may be more familiar with trends and customer preferences in that market. Also, our entry into the Kids category means we now compete with a number of additional companies that have been in the Kids category for a longer period of time and may have more experience in children\u2019s clothing. If any of the above were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nExpansion of our operations internationally requires management attention and resources, involves additional risks, and may be unsuccessful.\nIn May 2019, we launched our service in the UK market, and we may choose to expand to other international markets in the future. Prior to launching in the UK, we had no experience operating internationally or selling our merchandise outside of the United States, and if we continue to expand internationally, we will need to adapt to different local cultures, standards, laws, and policies. The business model we employ may not appeal as strongly to consumers in international markets. Furthermore, to succeed with clients in international locations, such as the UK, we will need to locate fulfillment centers in foreign markets and hire local employees, and we will have to invest in these facilities and employees before proving we can successfully run foreign operations. We may not be successful in expanding into additional international markets or in generating revenue from foreign operations for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022the need to localize our merchandise offerings, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices;\n\u2022different consumer demand dynamics, which may make our model and the merchandise we offer less successful compared to the United States;\n\u2022competition from local incumbents that understand the local market and may operate more effectively;\n\u2022regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, trade sanctions and economic embargoes, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions, or any unexpected changes thereto such as Brexit (as defined below);\n\u2022differing laws and regulations, including with respect to anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance;\n\u2022differing labor regulations where labor laws may be more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States and result in increased labor costs;\n\u2022more stringent or differing regulations relating to privacy and data security and access to, or use of, commercial and personal information, particularly in Europe;\n\u2022differing payment requirements and customer behavior relating to payments and fraud;\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, economic, and public health conditions; and\n\u2022risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates.\nFor example, clients in the UK are accustomed to more return shipping options than are typically offered in the United States, which required us to increase the number of shipping vendors we use in that market, increasing our costs. If we continue to invest substantial time and resources to establish and expand our operations internationally and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our operating results would suffer.\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate and we may not be profitable in the future.\nOur past revenue growth and profitability should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Our revenue increased by 22.8% in fiscal 2021 compared to 2020, 8.5% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, and 28.6% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. As we grow our business, our revenue growth rates may slow in future periods or decline due to a number of reasons, which may include the short- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, slowing demand for our merchandise and service, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth rate of our overall market, and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, as well as the maturation of our business.\nMoreover, our expenses have increased in recent periods, and we expect expenses to increase substantially in the near term, particularly as we make significant investments in our marketing initiatives; expand our geographic markets, operations, and infrastructure; develop and introduce new merchandise offerings; and hire additional personnel. We may not always pursue short-term profits but are often focused on long-term growth, which may impact our financial results. If our revenue does not increase to offset increases in our operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and we may not be able to maintain our brand and reputation.\nWe believe that maintaining the Stitch Fix brand and reputation is critical to driving client engagement and attracting clients and merchandise vendors. Building our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide our clients with an engaging and personalized client experience, including valued personal styling services, high-quality merchandise, and appropriate price points, which we may not do successfully. Client complaints or negative publicity about our styling services, merchandise, delivery times, or client support, especially on social media platforms, could harm our reputation and diminish client use of our services, the trust that our clients place in Stitch Fix, and vendor confidence in us.\nOur brand depends in part on effective client support, which requires significant personnel expense. Failure to manage or train our client support representatives properly or inability to handle client complaints effectively could negatively affect our brand, reputation, and operating results.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively promote and maintain the Stitch Fix brand, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our employees, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur success, including our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing style trends and deliver a personalized styling experience, depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our executive team and in our merchandising, algorithms, engineering, marketing, styling, and other organizations.\nWe do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our personnel. Senior employees have left Stitch Fix in the past and others may in the future, which we cannot necessarily anticipate and whom we may not be able to promptly replace. For example, after our former Chief Financial Officer left in December 2019, we conducted a search for a candidate to replace him that did not conclude until we announced the hiring of Dan Jedda as our Chief Financial Officer in December 2020. Additionally, our former President, Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Mike Smith, resigned as an employee of the Company in January 2021. The loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to promptly identify a suitable successor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not currently maintain key-person life insurance policies on any member of our senior management team or other key employees.\nElizabeth Spaulding was named to the role of Chief Executive Officer on August 1, 2021, and Katrina Lake, our Founder, transitioned to the role of Executive Chairperson of the Board on August 1, 2021. Currently, Ms. Lake remains an employee of ours. Ms. Lake has unique and valuable experience leading our company from its inception through August 1, 2021. If we do not continue to manage the transition of Ms. Lake to her new role and Ms. Spaulding\u2019s succession to Chief Executive Officer successfully, it could disrupt our business, affect our Company culture, or cause retention concerns with respect to our colleagues, all of which could affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe also face significant competition for personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters are located. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. Recently, we also have had difficulty hiring employees in fulfillment centers due to increased competition for distribution workers and rising wages. We have increased, and expect to continue to increase, our employee compensation levels in response to competition, as necessary. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future, or that the compensation costs of doing so will not adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, we may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, and employee morale, productivity, and retention could suffer, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our stylists, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nAs of July 31, 2021, approximately 5,700 of our employees were stylists, most of whom work remotely and on a part-time basis for us and are paid hourly. The stylists track and report the time they spend working for us. These employees are classified as nonexempt under federal and state law. If we fail to effectively manage our stylists, including by ensuring accurate tracking and reporting of their hours worked and proper processing of their hourly wages, then we may face claims alleging violations of wage and hour employment laws, including, without limitation, claims of back wages, unpaid overtime pay, and missed meal and rest periods. Any such employee litigation could be attempted on a class or representative basis. For example, in August 2020, a representative action under California\u2019s Private Attorneys General Act was filed against us alleging various violations of California\u2019s wage and hour laws relating to our current and former non-exempt stylist employees. While we were able to settle this matter, future litigation concerning our styling employees could be expensive and time-consuming regardless of whether the claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately determined to be liable, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. We could also be adversely affected by negative publicity, litigation costs resulting from the defense of these claims, and the diversion of time and resources from our operations.\nIn August 2021, we introduced changes to work schedules for our stylists to better align with when and how clients will most likely want to connect with their stylist. We anticipated that many of our stylists would find the new schedule challenging and may not want to continue their employment, so we offered a voluntary exit package to help ease job transitions. As expected, some stylists did accept this offer, which decreased our total number of stylists. We may experience some capacity constraints, morale issues or other unintended effects that could negatively affect our operations as we transition to these new scheduling practices.\nIf we are unable to acquire new merchandise vendors or retain existing merchandise vendors, our operating results may be harmed.\nWe offer merchandise from hundreds of established and emerging brands. In order to continue to attract and retain quality merchandise brands, we must help merchandise vendors increase their sales and offer them a high-quality, cost-effective fulfillment process.\nIf we do not continue to acquire new merchandise vendors or retain our existing merchandise vendors on acceptable commercial terms, we may not be able to maintain a broad selection of products for our clients, and our operating results may suffer.\nIn addition, our Exclusive Brands are sourced from third-party vendors and contract manufacturers. The loss of one of our Exclusive Brand vendors for any reason, or our inability to source any additional vendors needed for our Exclusive Brands, could require us to source Exclusive Brand merchandise from another vendor or manufacturer, which could cause inventory delays, impact our clients\u2019 experiences, and otherwise harm our operating results.\nWe may incur significant losses from fraud.\nWe have in the past incurred and may in the future incur losses from various types of fraud, including stolen credit card numbers, claims that a client did not authorize a purchase, merchant fraud, and clients who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in open bank accounts to satisfy payments. Our clients may re-use their login information (i.e., username and password combination) across multiple websites and, therefore, when a third-party website experiences a data breach, that information could be exposed to bad actors and be used to fraudulently access our clients\u2019 accounts. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if the fraud is related to credit card transactions and becomes excessive, it could result in us paying higher fees or losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, under current credit card practices, we are typically liable for fraudulent credit card transactions. Our failure to adequately prevent fraudulent transactions could damage our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory action, and lead to expenses that could substantially impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks.\nWe accept payments online via credit and debit cards and online payment systems such as PayPal, which subjects us to certain regulations and fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to clients that would be subject to additional regulations and risks. We pay interchange and other fees in connection with credit card payments, which may increase over time and adversely affect our operating results. While we use a third party to process payments, we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Industry, the Market, and the Economy\nWe rely on consumer discretionary spending and have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends.\nOur business and operating results are subject to global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Some of the factors that may negatively influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment; higher consumer debt levels; reductions in net worth, declines in asset values, and related market uncertainty; home foreclosures and reductions in home values; fluctuating interest rates, increased inflationary pressures and credit availability; fluctuating fuel and other energy costs; fluctuating commodity prices; and general uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment. We have experienced many of these factors due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses of national, state and local government and public health officials and have, at times, seen negative impacts on client demand as a result. Furthermore, any increases in consumer discretionary spending during times of crisis may be temporary, such as those related to government stimulus programs. Economic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, and wildfires; other public health crises; and other major unforeseen events. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including the merchandise that we offer, generally decline during recessionary periods or periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence.\nAdverse economic changes could reduce consumer confidence, and could thereby negatively affect our operating results. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict when macroeconomic uncertainty may arise, whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen or what impact such circumstances could have on our business.\nOur industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with eCommerce companies that market the same or similar merchandise and services that we offer; local, national, and global department stores; specialty retailers; discount chains; independent retail stores; and the online offerings of these traditional retail competitors. Additionally, we experience competition for consumer discretionary spending from other product and experiential categories. We believe our ability to compete depends on many factors within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022effectively differentiating our service and value proposition from those of our competitors;\n\u2022attracting new clients and engaging with existing clients;\n\u2022our direct relationships with our clients and their willingness to share personal information with us;\n\u2022further developing our data science capabilities;\n\u2022maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our services to clients;\n\u2022delivering merchandise that each client perceives as personalized to him or her;\n\u2022the amount, diversity, and quality of brands and merchandise that we or our competitors offer;\n\u2022our ability to expand and maintain appealing Exclusive Brands and exclusive-to-Stitch Fix merchandise;\n\u2022the price at which we are able to offer our merchandise;\n\u2022the speed and cost at which we can deliver merchandise to our clients and the ease with which they can use our services to return merchandise; and\n\u2022anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and consumer shopping preferences.\nMany of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories; larger fulfillment infrastructures; greater technical capabilities; faster shipping times; lower-cost shipping; larger databases; more purchasing power; higher profiles; greater financial, marketing, institutional, and other resources; and larger customer bases than we do. Mergers and acquisitions by these companies may lead to even larger competitors with more resources. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater revenue and profits from their existing customer bases; acquire customers at lower costs; or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies, changes in apparel trends and consumer shopping behavior, and changes in supply conditions. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, enter or expand their presence in the personalized retail market, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases or generate revenue from their existing customer bases more effectively than we do. If we fail to execute on any of the above better than our competitors, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences.\nOur success is, in large part, dependent upon our ability to identify apparel trends, predict and gauge the tastes of our clients, and provide a service that satisfies client demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our purchasing decisions may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or client acceptance of merchandise chosen by our merchandising buyers. In addition, external events may disrupt or change client preferences and behaviors in ways we are not able to anticipate. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to daily life, working arrangements, travel, and social events, which has impacted the type of apparel our clients seek to purchase. We generally enter into purchase contracts significantly in advance of anticipated sales and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by client purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our clients\u2019 preferences and acceptance levels of our merchandise with accuracy. Further, we use our data science to predict our clients\u2019 preferences and gauge demand for our merchandise, and there is no guarantee that our data science and algorithms will accurately anticipate client demand and tastes. Our entry into the UK also requires us to become familiar with different apparel trends and customer preferences. In addition, consumer shopping behavior may continue to evolve and we may need to adapt our service to such changes, which could be further complicated by any future expansion into additional geographic markets. To the extent we misjudge the market for the service we offer or fail to execute on trends and deliver attractive merchandise to clients, our sales will decline and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur operating results have been, and could be in the future, adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, and other adverse weather events and climate conditions, which may become more frequent and more severe with the increasing effects of climate change; unforeseen public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations in or cause us to close one or more of our offices and fulfillment centers or could disrupt, delay, or otherwise negatively impact the operations of one or more of our third-party providers or vendors. For instance, the severe winter weather and temperatures experienced in Texas and other parts of the country in February 2021 caused us to temporarily close two of our fulfillment centers and affected the shipping of merchandise in and out of fulfillment centers. Furthermore, these types of events could impact our merchandise supply chain, including our ability to ship merchandise to or receive returned merchandise from clients in the impacted region, and could impact our ability or the ability of third parties to operate our sites and ship merchandise. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions. In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has: disrupted our operations in and caused us to close our offices and require that most of our employees work from home; disrupted our operations in and caused us to close three of our fulfillment centers; required us to implement various operational changes to ensure the health and safety of our employees; had a range of negative effects on the operations of our third-party providers and vendors, including our merchandise supply chain and shipping partners; and negatively impacted consumer spending and the economy generally. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many of these factors to materialize, as described above and throughout these risk factors, it has adversely affected our business and operating results. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including future resurgences of COVID-19 or new variants in the United States or internationally) or the occurrence of another natural disaster or crisis could recreate and/or exacerbate these effects.\nCybersecurity, Legal and Regulatory Risks\nSystem interruptions that impair client access to our website or other performance failures in our technology infrastructure could damage our business.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability, and availability of our website, mobile application, internal applications, and technology infrastructure are critical to our business. We rely on our website and mobile application to engage with our clients and sell them merchandise. We also rely on a host of internal custom-built applications to run critical business functions, such as styling, merchandise purchasing, warehouse operations, and order fulfillment. In addition, we rely on a variety of third-party, cloud-based solution vendors for key elements of our technology infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption and we have experienced interruptions in the past. For example, in February 2017, as a result of an outage with Amazon Web Services, where much of our technology infrastructure is hosted, we experienced disruptions in applications that support our warehouse operations and order fulfillment that caused a temporary slowdown in the number of Fix shipments we were able to make. Additionally, the launch of a new category or new product offering requires investments in and the development of new technology, which may be more susceptible to performance issues or interruptions. Interruptions may also be caused by a variety of incidents, including human error, our failure to update or improve our proprietary systems, cyber attacks, fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, or telecommunications failures. These risks are exacerbated by our move to a more remote workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any failure or interruption of our website, mobile application, internal business applications, or our technology infrastructure could harm our ability to serve our clients, which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nCompromises of our data security could cause us to incur unexpected expenses and may materially harm our reputation and operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our vendors collect, process, and store certain personal information and other data relating to individuals, such as our clients and employees, which may include client payment card information. We rely substantially on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our processing, transmission, and storage of personal information and other confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that we or our vendors will not suffer a data compromise, that hackers or other unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information or other data, including payment card data or confidential business information, or that any such data compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely fashion. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, and we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As we have significantly increased the number of employees and contractors working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and expect to continue to have a more remote and hybrid work force, and as our vendors and other business partners move to permanent or hybrid remote work as well, we and our partners may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, our employees, contractors, vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate such personal information, confidential information, or other data, or may inadvertently release or compromise such data.\nCompromise of our data security or of third parties with whom we do business, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information, and delays in detecting or providing prompt notice of any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and subject us to litigation, government action, or other additional costs and liabilities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nSome of our software and systems contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary applications.\nWe use open source software in the applications we have developed to operate our business and will use open source software in the future. We may face claims from third parties demanding the release or license of the open source software or derivative works that we developed from such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly release the affected portions of our source code, or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. In addition, our use of open source software may present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our website and systems that rely on open source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are or may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\nCurrently, we are involved in various legal proceedings, including the securities litigation and other matters described elsewhere herein. We have in the past and may in the future become involved in other private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by clients, employees, suppliers, competitors, government agencies, stockholders, or others. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could give rise to new types of claims or lawsuits, including, without limitation, workers compensation claims for employees that contracted the COVID-19 virus. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time, and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAny failure by us or our vendors to comply with product safety, labor, or other laws, or our standard vendor terms and conditions, or to provide safe factory conditions for our or their workers, may damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business.\nThe merchandise we sell to our clients is subject to regulation by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and similar state and international regulatory authorities. As a result, such merchandise could in the future be subject to recalls and other remedial actions. Product safety, labeling, and licensing concerns may result in us voluntarily removing selected merchandise from our inventory. Such recalls or voluntary removal of merchandise can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation, and increased client service costs and legal expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nSome of the merchandise we sell, including the children\u2019s merchandise sold through Stitch Fix Kids, may expose us to product liability claims and litigation or regulatory action relating to personal injury or environmental or property damage. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular vendor\u2019s merchandise or our vendors may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations.\nWe purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and international vendors. Our standard vendor terms and conditions require vendors to comply with applicable laws. We have hired independent firms that conduct audits of the working conditions at the factories producing our Exclusive Brand products. If an audit reveals potential problems, we require that the vendor institute corrective action plans to bring the factory into compliance with our standards, or we may discontinue our relationship with the vendor. The loss of an Exclusive Brand vendor due to failure to comply with our standards could cause inventory delays, impact our clients\u2019 experiences, and otherwise harm our operating results. In addition, failure of our vendors to comply with applicable laws and regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation against us, resulting in increased legal expenses and costs. Furthermore, the failure of any such vendors to provide safe and humane factory conditions and oversight at their facilities could damage our reputation with clients or result in legal claims against us.\nThe United States Treasury Department placed sanctions on China\u2019s Xinjiang Production and Construction Corporation (\u201cXPCC\u201d) for serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in China\u2019s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (the \u201cXUAR\u201d). Additionally, the US CBP issued a withhold release order (the \u201cWRO\u201d) on all products containing cotton from the XUAR. The XUAR is the source of large amounts of cotton and textiles for the global apparel supply chain and XPCC controls many of the cotton farms and much of the textile industry in the region. Although we do not knowingly source any products or materials from the XUAR (either directly or indirectly through our suppliers), we have no known involvement with XPCC or its subsidiaries and affiliates, and we prohibit our apparel vendors from doing business with XPCC, we could be subject to penalties, fines or sanctions if any of the vendors from which we purchase goods is found to have dealings, directly or indirectly, with XPCC or entities it controls. Additionally, our products or materials (including potentially non-cotton materials) could be held or delayed by the US CBP under the WRO, which would cause delays and unexpectedly affect our inventory levels. Even if we were not subject to penalties, fines or sanctions, if products we source are linked in any way to XPCC or the XUAR, our reputation could be damaged.\nOur use of personal information and other data subjects us to privacy laws and obligations, and our compliance with or failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe collect and maintain significant amounts of personal information and other data relating to our clients and employees. Numerous laws, rules, and regulations in the United States and internationally, including the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) and the UK\u2019s Data Protection Act (the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d), govern privacy and the collection, use, and protection of personal information. These laws, rules, and regulations evolve frequently and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may be interpreted to conflict with our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or with other obligations to which we may be or become subject, may result in actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Any such action would be expensive to defend, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and operating results. For example, the GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws. Further, the UK withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, subject to a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d). The regulation of data protection in the UK after December 31, 2020 is still uncertain and depends on ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU. The UK GDPR is currently consistent with the GDPR in effect since 2018, but it may evolve following the end of the transition period and it is uncertain whether our operations in, and data transfers to and from, the UK can comply with any future changes in the law. Similarly, the State of California legislature passed the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use, and sharing practices. The CCPA also allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches with the possibility of significant statutory damage awards. The CCPA prohibits discrimination against individuals who exercise their privacy rights, provides for civil penalties for violations, and creates a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA itself will expand substantially when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), which California voters approved in November 2020, takes effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information that we handle; further restrict the sharing of personal information; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since the enactment of the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the U.S. states and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data.\nThe costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy and data security laws and regulations may reduce the efficiency of our marketing, lead to negative publicity, make it more difficult or more costly to meet expectations of or commitments to clients, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, any of which could harm our business. These laws could also impact our ability to offer our products in certain locations. The costs, burdens, and potential liabilities imposed by existing privacy laws could be compounded if other jurisdictions in the U.S. or abroad begin to adopt similar or more restrictive laws.\nEven the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit clients\u2019 use of our service or harm our brand and reputation.\nAny of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nUnfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with evolving internet and eCommerce regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and eCommerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, privacy and data security, consumer protection, the ability to collect and/or share necessary information that allows us to conduct business on the internet, marketing communications and advertising, content protection, electronic contracts, or gift cards. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape impacting internet and eCommerce businesses is constantly evolving. For example, California\u2019s Automatic Renewal Law requires companies to adhere to enhanced disclosure requirements when entering into automatically renewing contracts with consumers. As a result, a wave of consumer class action lawsuits was brought against companies that offer online products and services on a subscription or recurring basis. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, lost business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could impact our operating results.\nIf the use of \u201ccookie\u201d tracking technologies is further restricted, regulated, or blocked, or if changes in technology cause cookies to become less reliable or acceptable as a means of tracking consumer behavior, the amount or accuracy of internet user information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business and operating results.\nCookies are small data files that are sent by websites and stored locally on an internet user's computer or mobile device. We, and third parties who work on our behalf, collect data via cookies that is used to track the behavior of visitors to our sites, to provide a more personal and interactive experience, and to increase the effectiveness of our marketing. However, internet users can easily disable, delete, and block cookies directly through browser settings or through other software, browser extensions, or hardware platforms that physically block cookies from being created and stored.\nPrivacy regulations restrict how we deploy our cookies and this could potentially increase the number of internet users that choose to proactively disable cookies on their systems. In the EU, the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications requires users to give their consent before cookie data can be stored on their local computer or mobile device. Users can decide to opt out of nearly all cookie data creation, which could negatively impact our operating results. We may have to develop alternative systems to determine our clients\u2019 behavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently market to them if clients block cookies or regulations introduce additional barriers to collecting cookie data.\nIf we cannot successfully protect our intellectual property, our business would suffer.\nWe rely on trademark, copyright, trade secrets, patents, confidentiality agreements, and other practices to protect our brands, proprietary information, technologies, and processes. Our principal trademark assets include the registered trademarks \u201cStitch Fix\u201d and \u201cFix,\u201d multiple private label clothing and accessory brand names, and our logos and taglines. Our trademarks are valuable assets that support our brand and consumers\u2019 perception of our services and merchandise. We also hold the rights to the \u201cstitchfix.com\u201d internet domain name and various other related domain names, which are subject to internet regulatory bodies and trademark and other related laws of each applicable jurisdiction. If we are unable to protect our trademarks or domain names in the United States, the UK, or in other jurisdictions in which we may ultimately operate, our brand recognition and reputation would suffer, we would incur significant expense establishing new brands and our operating results would be adversely impacted.\nWe currently have nine patents issued and a number of additional patent applications pending in the United States. We have also filed patent applications in Europe and the People\u2019s Republic of China. The patents we own and those that may be issued in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties, and our patent applications may never be granted. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that these patents will adequately protect our intellectual property or survive a legal challenge, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. Our limited patent protection may restrict our ability to protect our technologies and processes from competition. We primarily rely on trade secret laws to protect our technologies and processes, including the algorithms we use throughout our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies and processes, or may improperly acquire and use information about our technologies and processes, which may allow them to provide a service similar to ours, which could harm our competitive position.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and the efforts we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient.\nWe may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe are also at risk of claims by others that we have infringed their copyrights, trademarks, or patents, or improperly used or disclosed their trade secrets. The costs of supporting any litigation or disputes related to these claims can be considerable, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve a favorable outcome of any such claim. If any such claims are valid, we may be compelled to cease our use of such intellectual property and pay damages, which could adversely affect our business. Even if such claims are not valid, defending them could be expensive and distracting, adversely affecting our operating results.\nRisks Relating to Taxes\nChanges in U.S. tax or tariff policy regarding apparel produced in other countries could adversely affect our business.\nA predominant portion of the apparel we sell is originally manufactured in countries other than the United States. International trade disputes that result in tariffs and other protectionist measures could adversely affect our business, including disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. For example, in recent years, the U.S. government imposed significant new tariffs on China related to the importation of certain product categories, including apparel, footwear, and other goods. A substantial portion of our products are manufactured in China. As a result of these tariffs, our cost of goods imported from China increased slightly. Although we continue to work with our vendors to mitigate our exposure to current or potential tariffs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset any increased costs. Other changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships, or tax provisions could also reduce the supply of goods available to us or increase our cost of goods. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt to and manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of such uncertainty, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues, reduce our profitability, and negatively impact our business.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our clients would have to pay for our offering and adversely affect our operating results.\nIn general, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in any jurisdictions in which we do not have a tax nexus, in reliance on court decisions and/or applicable exemptions that restrict or preclude the imposition of obligations to collect such taxes with respect to the online sales of our products. In addition, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we do have a physical presence, in reliance on applicable exemptions. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. As of June 30, 2021, all states have enacted legislation to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. While we now collect, remit, and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax, it is still possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability from previous periods for which we did not collect sales, use, or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful it could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFederal income tax reform could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. enacted the CARES Act. We provided for an estimated effect of the CARES Act in our financial statements for the period ended July 31, 2021. The CARES Act requires significant judgments to be made in the interpretation of the law and significant estimates in the calculation of the provision for income taxes. However, additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nWe may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to income- and non-income-based taxes in the United States under federal, state, and local jurisdictions and in the UK. The governing tax laws and applicable tax rates vary by jurisdiction and are subject to interpretation. Various tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and if any such tax authorities were to successfully challenge one or more of our tax positions, the results could have a material effect on our operating results. Further, the ultimate amount of tax payable in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by sudden or unforeseen changes in tax laws, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdictions, or changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. The determination of our overall provision for income and other taxes is inherently uncertain as it requires significant judgment around complex transactions and calculations. As a result, fluctuations in our ultimate tax obligations may differ materially from amounts recorded in our financial statements and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results in the periods for which such determination is made.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $142.0 million, which begin to expire in 2025, if not utilized. The ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards depends on the availability of future taxable income. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, we had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of $30.1 million and $17.0 million, respectively. The federal research and development credits will begin to expire in 2036, if not utilized; California research and development credits do not have an expiration date. A portion of our tax attributes are subject to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions, which sets limitations arising from ownership changes. Any potential limitations on our ability to offset future income with our tax attributes could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our client base, the level of client engagement and client acquisition, revenue, or other operating results;\n\u2022variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors, and the financial community;\n\u2022any forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide to the public or securities analysts, any changes in this information, or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;\n\u2022actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022whether investors or securities analysts view our stock structure unfavorably, particularly our dual-class structure and the significant voting control of our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates;\n\u2022additional shares of our Class A common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of companies in our industry, including our vendors and competitors;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022targeted efforts of social media or other groups to transact in and affect the price of Stitch Fix stock, such as the activity in early 2021 targeting GameStop Corp and others;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022developments in new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many eCommerce and other technology companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in October 2018, we and certain of our directors and officers were sued in putative class action and derivative lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well. Such securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and seriously harm our business.\nMoreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, then the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. In addition, shares underlying any outstanding options and restricted stock units will become eligible for sale if exercised or settled, as applicable, and to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rule 144 of the Securities Act. All the shares of Class A and Class B common stock subject to stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and reserved for issuance under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, our 2017 Incentive Plan, and our 2019 Inducement Plan have been registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and such shares are eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, and may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, are able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, even if their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. As of September 21, 2021, 31,476,875 of our 108,731,974 shares outstanding were held by our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, and 29,233,301 of such shares held by our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates were shares of Class B common stock. This concentration of ownership will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may cause us to make strategic decisions that could involve risks to you or that may not be aligned with your interests. This control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor\u2019s announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual class capital structure currently makes us ineligible for inclusion in Standard & Poor\u2019s indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track the S&P indices will not be investing in our stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, these policies have had or may have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation of the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, any investment return our Class A common stock will depend upon increases in the value for our Class A common stock, which is not certain.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u2022provide that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022reflect the dual class structure of our common stock; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our reported financial information and this may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. We have in the past experienced material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls, including for our fiscal year ended August 3, 2019. Management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2021. However, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we or our accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, it could harm our operating results, adversely affect our reputation, or result in inaccurate financial reporting. Furthermore, should any such deficiencies arise we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including SEC enforcement actions and we could be required to restate our financial results, any of which would require additional financial and management resources.\nEven if we do not detect deficiencies, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud, and individuals, including employees and contractors, could circumvent such controls. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIn addition, we may encounter difficulties in the timely and accurate reporting of our financial results, which would impact our ability to provide our investors with information in a timely manner. Should we encounter such difficulties, our investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our reported financial information and trading price of our common stock. could be negatively impacted.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available or may be available only by diluting existing stockholders.\nWe intend to continue making investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to support this growth and respond to business challenges, including the need to develop our services, expand our inventory, enhance our operating infrastructure, expand the markets in which we operate, and potentially acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We are also party to an amended and restated credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders that contains covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions, and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain minimum free cash flow and an adjusted current ratio above specified levels, measured in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter. The restrictive covenants of this or any future debt financing secured may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business and prospects could fail or be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our Class A common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nFuture securities sales and issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and impair the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may issue additional equity securities in the future. We also issue common stock to our employees and others under our incentive plans. Future issuances of shares of our Class A common stock or the conversion of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock, or the perception that these sales or conversions may occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and result in dilution to existing holders of our Class A common stock. Also, to the extent outstanding options to purchase our shares of our Class A or Class B common stock are exercised or options or other stock-based awards are issued or become vested, there will be further dilution. The amount of dilution could be substantial depending upon the size of the issuances or exercises. Furthermore, we may issue additional equity securities that could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock bear the risk that future issuances of debt or equity securities may reduce the value of our Class A common stock and further dilute their ownership interest.", "PERMNO": 17038, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "SFIX"}
