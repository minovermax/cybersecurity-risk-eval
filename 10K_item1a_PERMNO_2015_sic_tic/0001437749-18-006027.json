Risk Factors.\nThe following is a description of what we consider the key challenges and risks relating to our business and investing in our common stock. This discussion should be considered in conjunction with the discussion under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Information\u201d in Part I, the information set forth under Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d and with the discussion of the business included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d These risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware. If any of the events or developments described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nMedAmerica has limited assets and operations.\nMedAmerica is a real estate management company with limited assets and operations. Without revenue, we are currently dependent upon private placement capital fundraising, and loans and equity infusions from a related party to meet our cash needs. Our ability to continue on an on-going basis is dependent upon, among other things, raising capital, obtaining debt financing and identifying medical office buildings to source, manage and co-invest, among other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available to us and may limit our operations or growth.\nWe will need additional capital to fund the implementation of our business plan. We cannot assure you that any necessary subsequent financing will be successful. Our future liquidity and capital requirements are difficult to predict as they depend upon many factors, including our ability to identify and complete acquisitions and the success of any business we do acquire. We will need to raise additional funds in order to meet working capital requirements or additional capital expenditures or to take advantage of other opportunities. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise needed capital, our growth and operations may be impeded. In addition, if we raise capital by selling additional shares of stock, your percentage ownership in MedAmerica will be diluted.\nA growth strategy of making acquisitions subjects us to all of the risks inherent in identifying, acquiring and operating newly acquired businesses.\nOur board has approved the current strategy that includes the acquisition, purchase, and management of well-located medical office buildings throughout the United States, with the intention to aggregate multiple properties with strong fundamentals in certain attractive geographic locations, particularly in the sunbelt states. In the future, we may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in, medical office buildings. To that end, we may spend significant management time and resources in analyzing and negotiating acquisitions or investments that are not consummated and the strategy may not be implemented at all. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we will identify medical office buildings to acquire, or if we do, that we will be able to acquire such properties on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, we may seek equity or debt financing for particular acquisitions, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We will also face all the risks associated with an acquisition strategy, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nentering new markets in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u25cf\nfailure to identify in due diligence key issues specific to the properties we seek to acquire, or failure to protect against contingent liabilities arising from those acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen or hidden liabilities;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in integrating, aligning and coordinating the acquisition of properties in different geographic location;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u25cf\nthe potential for future impairments of goodwill if an acquired property does not perform as expected;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to obtain necessary approvals for an acquisition, if any; and\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully operating the acquired medical office buildings.\nIf we cannot overcome these challenges, we may not realize actual benefits from past and future acquisitions, which will impair our overall business results. If we complete an investment or acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction.\nCertain employees and directors own a significant interest in MedAmerica.\nCertain directors and officers control 31.72% of our outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2017. Accordingly, they possess a significant vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders including the election of the members of our board. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of preventing or discouraging transactions involving an actual or a potential change of control of MedAmerica, regardless of whether a premium is offered over then-current market prices.\nThe current state of debt markets could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nThe cost of commercial debt may increase or may contract as a result of certain factors including the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies. Credit spreads for major sources of capital may grow significantly as investors may demand a higher risk premium. Should our borrowing cost increase, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, we will need to factor such increases into the economics of our business plan. This may result in our generating lower overall economic returns and potentially reducing cash flow available for business operations and business development.\nRisks Relating to Our Shares\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nPrivate Placement\nIn February 2017, management began approaching certain accredited investors offering unregistered shares of the Company\u2019s common stock for $1.50 a share in order to raise working capital and fund our operations (the \u201c2017 Private Placement\u201d). Through December 31, 2017, the Company accepted subscriptions for $1,940,005 in the 2017 Private Placement. The issuances of common stock were made in reliance on section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering and rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act. The proceeds of the 2017 Private Placement will be used for working capital and to fund operations and repay a related party note and accrued interest.\nOutstanding convertible preferred stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs a result of the private placements including issuances of preferred stock in 2012 and prior years, there are shares of outstanding preferred stock which can be converted into as many as 10,000 shares of our common stock. If the shares of preferred stock are converted, your ownership of the Company will be diluted.\nIf you invest in MedAmerica, you may experience substantial dilution and the market price of our shares may decrease.\nIn the event we identify and obtain a medical office building, there may be a dilutive effect on the holders of our securities. In addition, as part of our recruitment process and in connection with our efforts to attract and retain employees and directors, we may offer stock options, restricted stock or other types of equity-based incentives to our future employees and directors. The Company\u2019s issuance of equity-based incentives to new hires, senior management and directors, may cause you significant dilution as a result of such issuances. In 2017 we issued a significant number of common shares to raise capital and retire shares of our preferred stock. Although shares of common stock issued in conjunction with private placements and to be issued upon conversion of our preferred stock will be \u201crestricted\u201d securities under the Securities Act of 1933 prior to any registration statement being filed and being declared effective by the SEC, they may nonetheless be sold prior to that time in reliance on registration exemptions contained in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, subject to certain resale restrictions imposed by Rule 144. Such issuances and sales may also depress the market price of our shares.\nYou may not be able to sell your shares because there is a limited market for our stock.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the OTCQB, currently there is limited trading volume in our stock and there may be very limited demand for it as well. As a result, it may be difficult for you to sell our common stock despite the fact it is traded on the OTCQB.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends depends on our future earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors that our board of directors may consider relevant. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends, the return on your investment may be limited to the market price of the shares.", "PERMNO": 69147, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "BRST"}
