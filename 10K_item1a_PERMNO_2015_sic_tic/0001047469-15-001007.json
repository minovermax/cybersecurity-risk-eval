{"cik": "88205", "company": "SPX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n(All currency and share amounts are in millions)\nYou should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.\nWe face risks related to our planned spin-off of our flow business.\nWe have announced our intention to spin-off our Flow Technology reportable segment and our Hydraulic Technologies business, comprising approximately $2,800.0 of our company's total revenues for 2014. Unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining required approvals, uncertainty of the financial markets, and challenges relating to the structure of the transaction or resulting companies, could delay or prevent the planned transaction, or cause it to occur on less favorable terms or conditions than projected. In addition, in connection with the spin-off, we and the new stand-alone company that will result from the spin-off will need to incur new indebtedness to refinance our existing credit facilities. We and the new stand-alone company may be unable to obtain such indebtedness or any indebtedness that we and the new stand-alone company obtain may contain terms that are materially less favorable than the terms of our existing credit facilities. Even if the transaction is completed as and on the timetable currently contemplated, we may not realize some or all projected benefits, or expenses relating to the planned transaction may be significantly higher than projected.\nAdditionally, the planned transaction requires significant time and attention, which could distract management and other employee attention from the day-to-day operation of our business. Following completion of the transaction, there can be no guarantee the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will equal or exceed the value of our stock had the transaction not occurred.\nThe planned spin-off of our flow business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.\nAmong the conditions to completing the spin-off will be our receipt of opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as to the tax-free treatment of the spin-off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions, the spin-off or a related transaction is determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new stand-alone company would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of the new stand-alone company are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin-off. In this event, the resulting tax liability would be substantial. In connection with the spin-off, we expect to enter into a tax matters agreement with the new stand-alone company, under which it will agree (i) not to enter into any transaction without our consent that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to us, and (ii) to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such a transaction. This obligation and potential tax liability may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us or of the new stand-alone company. In addition, we may have to restructure various aspects of the transaction in response to tax considerations, which could subject us to significant additional costs.\nDifficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.\nWe are an increasingly global company. In 2014, over 50% of our revenues were generated outside the United States. We have placed a particular emphasis on expanding our presence in emerging markets. As part of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our reliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;\n\u2022 Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;\n\u2022 Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other anti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets;\n\u2022 Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;\n\u2022 Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;\n\u2022 Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our operations;\n\u2022 Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022 Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;\n\u2022 Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;\n\u2022 Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of \"normal trade relations\" status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;\n\u2022 Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;\n\u2022 Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise;\n\u2022 Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and\n\u2022 Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services.\nAny of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in China, South Africa and other emerging markets or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.\nMany of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.\nMany of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 The oil and gas, chemical, mining and petrochemical markets;\n\u2022 Food and beverage markets; and\n\u2022 The electric power and infrastructure markets.\nIn addition, contract timing on large construction projects, including food and beverage systems, projects in the oil and gas industries, and cooling systems and towers, may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.\nThe businesses of many of our customers, particularly oil and gas companies, chemical companies and general industrial companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See \"MD&A - Results of Reportable Segments and Other Operating Segments.\" In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, some of our key businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nCost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to long-term fixed-price contracts.\nA portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularly in our Flow Technology and Thermal Equipment and Services reportable segments. We recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.\nEstimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.\nTo the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.\nOur large power projects in South Africa are an example of these types of long-term-contract-related risks. These projects, which have already experienced significant delays from their initial target completion dates, involve a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, the prime contractors, and the various subcontractors and suppliers. Although we believe that our current estimates of costs relating to these projects are reasonable, we cannot assure you that additional costs will not arise as these projects are completed.\nOur business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds, and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers could be impacted by commodity availability and prices.\nA number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices may increase our customers' cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.\nOn the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause mines, oil refineries, oil and gas extraction fields and other customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. For example, recent declines in oil prices have led to reduced revenues in the upstream portion of our oil and gas business. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.\nThe price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials or shortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.\nCredit and counterparty risks could harm our business.\nThe financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables.\nOur customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and\nregulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nIn addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellation or delay of orders.\nFailure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology (\"IT\") networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers, and we rely on the systems and services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses and attempts to gain authorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Security breaches of our, our customers' and our vendors' IT infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information or other confidential business information. If we are unable to prevent, detect or adequately respond to such breaches, our operations could be disrupted, our competitiveness could be adversely affected or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. Such incidents also could require significant management attention and resources and increased costs.\nCurrency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.\nOur operating results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.\nWorldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.\nMany of our customers historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our:\n\u2022 Revenues;\n\u2022 Margins;\n\u2022 Profits;\n\u2022 Cash flows;\n\u2022 Customers' orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;\n\u2022 Customers' ability to access credit;\n\u2022 Customers' ability to pay amounts due to us; and\n\u2022 Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.\nOur projections for 2015 assume a generally stable economy. If actual economic conditions are inconsistent with this assumption, our performance could underperform our expectations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.\nWe are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character or magnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.\nWe face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNumerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, and risk management matters (e.g., product and general liability, automobile, and workers' compensation claims), have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nWe devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.\nWe cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSee \"MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates - Contingent Liabilities\" and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nGovernmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.\nChanges in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant law and regulation. Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other anti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets.\nIn addition, costs associated with regulatory compliance can be difficult to predict. If we underestimate the time or costs required to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, our actual costs may significantly exceed our projections, which could impact our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.\nAs a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nOfficials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Splitting project. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.\nThe loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had $1,369.7 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $313.2 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to borrowings under the domestic revolving loan facility of $133.0 and $53.8 reserved for outstanding letters of credit, and $70.0 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement after giving effect to outstanding borrowings of $10.0. In addition, at December 31, 2014, we had $304.7 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $695.3 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2014, our cash and equivalents balance was $427.6. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:\n\u2022 Impact our ability and the ability of the new stand-alone company that will result from the planned spin-off to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, as needed in connection with the spin-off, on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022 Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u2022 Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;\n\u2022 Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022 Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and\n\u2022 Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nNumerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.\nWe may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.\nOur senior credit facilities, the indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities, indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.\nIf we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities, indenture governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities, indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.\nWe sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we must invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur strategy to outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nIn areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.\nWe strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, and (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.\nOur failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.\nWe may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.\nOur failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.\nOur acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u2022 Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;\n\u2022 Diversion of management attention from core business operations;\n\u2022 Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;\n\u2022 Increased expenses;\n\u2022 Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;\n\u2022 Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;\n\u2022 Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; and\n\u2022 Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.\nIn addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.\nOur integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nDispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.\nOur dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share.\nIf dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. See \"Business,\" \"MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,\" and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.\nIncreases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2014, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 2.3 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006, 2011 and 2012, and our 2006 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Incentive Plan. Additionally, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, either through an existing shelf registration statement or through other mechanisms. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.\nIf the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $2,286.4. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.\nThe fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.\nWe are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had over 14,000 employees. Seven domestic collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 1,000 employees. We also had various collective labor arrangements as of that date covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.\nOur technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.\nWe believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.\nCost reduction actions may affect our business.\nCost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions.\nOur current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.\nWe cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide\nremediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nChanges in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2014, these plans were underfunded by $332.7. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans' expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans' expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See \"MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on shareholders' ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a \"business combination\" with an \"interested shareholder\" (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.", "PERMNO": 55212, "SIC": 3585, "TIC": "SPXC"}
