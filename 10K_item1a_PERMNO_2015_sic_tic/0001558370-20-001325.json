{"cik": "1557746", "company": "Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report, as well as general economic and business risks, together with any other documents we file with the SEC. If any of the following events actually occur or risks actually materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since inception, we have incurred significant net losses. We incurred net losses of $161.4 million and $132.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $453.5 million. We have financed our operations over the last several years primarily from public offerings and a private placement of our common stock, as well as debt financing that has since been repaid in full. We have one commercial product, ESKATA, that we are no longer distributing, marketing or selling, one late-stage investigational drug candidate and other preclinical and clinical drug candidates that we are developing.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to the development of our drug candidates, including preclinical studies and clinical trials, and from 2018 to October 2019, to the commercialization of our products. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses in the near term as we:\n\u00b7\npursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and seeking to consummate transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates and ESKATA;\n\u00b7\ncontinue the clinical development of ATI-450, our MK2 inhibitor, as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and potentially an additional immuno-inflammatory indication;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop our preclinical drug candidates, including ATI-1777, a soft-JAK inhibitor, and ATI-2138, an ITJ inhibitor;\n\u00b7\nseek to discover and develop additional drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u00b7\nincur legal, accounting, investor relations and other administrative expenses in operating as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates and pursuing strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, for the further development and/or commercialization of our drug candidates, as well as discovering and developing additional drug candidates. We are in the early stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never earn revenue from our drug candidates that is significant enough to achieve profitability.\nFor any of our drug candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon our ability to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize those drug candidates. Further, we will be dependent on our potential third-party partners\u2019 ability to obtain marketing approval and successfully commercialize the product, upon the size of the markets in the territories where marketing approval is obtained, the accepted price for the product, and the ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement, if any. If we fail to identify and enter into partnerships with third parties to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, any partnerships we enter into do not result in the successful development, marketing approval for and commercialization of our drug candidates, the number of addressable patients is not as significant as estimated by our potential third-party partners, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than expected, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not earn significant revenue from agreements with potential third-party partners for such drug candidates, even if the drug candidates are approved for marketing.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected, or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials, the development of any of our drug candidates or the identification and consummation of transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, our expenses could increase.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations.\nIdentifying potential drug candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical and clinical development. In addition, we may not be able to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, and our drug candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Furthermore, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $75.0 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the date of this Annual Report will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than 12 months from the date of this report based on our current operating assumptions. These assumptions may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Changes may occur beyond our control that would cause us to consume our available capital before that time, including changes in and progress of our development activities, acquisitions of additional products or drug candidates, and changes in regulation. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe number and development requirements of the drug candidates that we may pursue;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and conducting preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we in-license or acquire additional drug candidates and technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7\nour ability to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, and earn revenue from such arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nthe revenue earned from our commercial products as a result of licenses to, or partnerships with, third parties.\nWe expect that we will require additional capital to complete the clinical development of ATI-450, to develop our preclinical compounds and to support our discovery efforts. Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations.\nOur business is dependent on the successful development of our drug candidate, ATI-450.\nOur pipeline includes ATI-450, our investigational oral, novel, selective MK2 inhibitor compound, which we are developing for rheumatoid arthritis and potentially for an additional immuno-inflammatory indication. We expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial for ATI-450 in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis in the first half of 2020. The success of our business will significantly depend on our successful development of and/or our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize ATI-450.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, intellectual property, potential future revenue streams or drug candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can earn substantial revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and license and partnership agreements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through partnerships, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third-party partners, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, intellectual property, potential future revenue streams, or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development efforts or grant rights to third parties to develop technologies, intellectual property, or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop ourselves.\nWe have a limited operating history and recently changed our strategic focus to focus on the development of our immuno-inflammatory portfolio, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur operations over the last several years have been largely focused on raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials, and acquiring new drug candidates and related intellectual property. In 2018 and 2019, we were also focused on the commercialization of two commercial products. In September 2019, we announced the completion of a strategic review of our business, as a result of which we are refocusing our resources on our immuno-inflammatory development programs and are pursuing strategic alternatives, including seeking partners, for our investigational drug candidates and ESKATA. We have had limited time to demonstrate our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a longer history of developing and partnering drugs. We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in obtaining marketing approval for our drug candidates and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary\ninformation, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, and the further development or commercialization of our drug candidates by a potential third-party partner could be delayed.\nRisks Related to the Development and Potential Commercialization of Our Drug Candidates\nIf we are unable to successfully develop our drug candidates and to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be harmed.\nWe have invested significant efforts and financial resources in the development of our drug candidates and the identification of potential drug candidates. Our ability to earn substantial revenue from our drug candidates will depend heavily on our ability to successfully develop and pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize these drug candidates. The success of any drug candidates that we develop, including A-101 45% Topical Solution and ATI-450, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful development of manufacturing processes for any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of timely approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nthe identification and consummation of transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe commercial launch of our drug candidates by a third-party partner, if approved;\n\u00b7\nour third-party partners\u2019 ability to achieve acceptance of our drug candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, and willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for our drug candidates when third-party payor coverage and reimbursement is limited or unavailable;\n\u00b7\nour third-party partners\u2019 ability to achieve success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, perceived advantages, cost, safety and efficacy of alternative treatments for the proposed indications of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates and otherwise protecting the intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs;\n\u00b7\nour third-party partners\u2019 ability to compete effectively with other treatment procedures; and\n\u00b7\nour third-party partners\u2019 ability to maintain a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of our drug candidates following marketing approval.\nWhether marketing approval will be granted is unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Our drug candidates\u2019 success in clinical trials will not guarantee marketing approval. If, following submission, the NDA for any drug candidate is not accepted for substantive review, or even if it is accepted for substantive review, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require additional studies or clinical trials, additional data, or additional manufacturing steps, or require other conditions before they will reconsider or approve the application. If the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities require additional studies, clinical trials or data, this could increase costs and cause delays in the marketing approval process, which may require the expenditure of additional resources. These delays would also impact our ability to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. In addition, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not consider sufficient any additional required studies, clinical trials, data or information that we perform and complete or generate, or we may decide to abandon the program.\nIt is possible that our drug candidates currently in development will never obtain marketing approval. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party\npartners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, which would harm our business.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development of and pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates.\nThe risk of failure for our drug candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our drug candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drug candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in humans for use in the target indication. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome.\nA failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drugs.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, including:\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites or prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials of our drug candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, including failure to demonstrate statistical significance, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon drug development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nour drug candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u00b7\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of clinical trials of our drug candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u00b7\nthe supply or quality of our drug candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the institutional review boards of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our drug candidates, our costs will increase, our drug candidate development process will be slowed, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates\nwill be harmed, and our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates will be delayed. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our drug candidates. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our drug candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our drug candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may not be able to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, and our potential third-party partners may:\n\u00b7\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u00b7\nobtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7\nobtain marketing approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nhave the drug removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur drug development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which our potential third-party partners may have the exclusive right to commercialize our drug candidates or allow competitors to bring drugs to market before such third-party partners do, which would impact our ability to successfully identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials, our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nSuccessful and timely completion of clinical trials will require that we enroll a sufficient number of subjects. Subject enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population. Trials may be subject to delays as a result of subject enrollment taking longer than anticipated or subject withdrawal. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. We cannot predict how successful we will be at enrolling subjects in future clinical trials. Subject enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u00b7\nthe eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u00b7\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the drug candidate in the trial;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of drugs approved to treat the skin disease in the trial;\n\u00b7\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u00b7\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us or them to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, we rely on and expect to continue to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and we will have limited influence over their performance. Any delays in completing clinical trials would delay or prevent our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, or serious adverse or unacceptable side effects may be identified during the development of our drug candidates, which could prevent or delay our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, increase our costs or necessitate the abandonment or limitation of the development of some of our drug candidates.\nBefore any potential third-party partners can obtain marketing approvals for the commercial sale of our drug candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our drug candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication, and failures can occur at any stage of testing. Clinical trials often fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the drug candidate studied for the target indication.\nIf our drug candidates are associated with side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses in which the side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The FDA or an institutional review board may also require that we suspend, discontinue, or limit our clinical trials based on safety information. Such findings could further result in regulatory authorities failing to provide marketing authorization for our drug candidates. Many drug candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the drug candidate.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by our drugs, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approval to market such product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the labels;\n\u00b7\na medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients may be required;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u00b7\nour reputation and physician or patient acceptance of our drug candidates, if approved, may suffer; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates would be harmed.\nAny of these events could prevent us from pursuing strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize the particular drug candidate and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in methods of drug candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs drug candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval. Any of these changes could cause our drug candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our drug candidates and jeopardize our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to increase our pipeline of drug candidates, including by in-licensing or acquiring additional drug candidates.\nA key element of our strategy is to build and expand our pipeline of drug candidates. To build our pipeline, we may seek to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates. We may not be able to identify or develop drug candidates that are safe, tolerable and effective. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential drug candidates that we identify, in-license or acquire may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular drug candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on drug candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and management resources, we focus on development programs and drug candidates that we identify for specific indications. As such, we are currently primarily focused on the development of ATI-450 as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and an additional immuno-inflammatory indication. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other drug candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future development programs and drug candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable drugs. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular drug candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug candidate through partnerships, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such drug candidate.\nFor any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval, our third-party partners may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nFor any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval, our third-party partners may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If our third-party partners fail to obtain an adequate level of acceptance for our drug candidates, we may not earn significant revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any drug candidate, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy, safety and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nour third-party partners\u2019 ability to offer the products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new treatments and of physicians to prescribe these treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our potential third-party partners to retain a sales force;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of our potential third-party partners\u2019 marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement or the willingness of patients to pay for these products;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u00b7\nany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We will face competition with respect to any drug candidates that we may seek to develop or through our potential third-party partners, commercialize, in the future, from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.\nWith respect to A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts, we are aware of at least two other companies that are developing a drug candidate for the treatment of common warts. In addition, there are over-the-counter drugs for the treatment of common warts and other drugs that have been used off-label as treatments for common warts.\nWith respect to ATI-450 as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, there are numerous commercial products, such as anti-TNFs, anti-IL6s, anti-IL1s and JAK inhibitors, approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we are aware of a number of companies conducting late-stage clinical trials for investigational drug candidates for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe commercial opportunity for our drug candidates, if approved, could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than a drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than our third-party partners\u2019 may obtain approval for our drug candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before our drug candidates are able to enter the market.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and preclinical and clinical development than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our development programs.\nThe success of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on coverage and adequate reimbursement or the willingness of patients to pay for these products.\nWe believe the success of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend on obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement as a prescription treatment or in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement, on the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out of pocket for our prescription drug products.\nThird-party payors determine which prescription drug products they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including: the third-party payor\u2019s determination that a product is safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals or current clinical practice guidelines; and whether there are competitive products, either branded or generic, and the pricing of those products. Many private third-party payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to drug products\u2019 coverage partly to control costs for their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement can be a time-consuming and expensive process, and our potential third-party partners may not be able to negotiate or continue to negotiate reimbursement or pricing terms for our products with third-party payors at levels that are profitable to us, or at all.\nIn addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. Accordingly, these updates could impact the demand for our drug candidates, if approved. Our drug candidates, if approved, may not be considered cost effective, and government and third-party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients or sufficient to allow our potential third-party partners to sell our drug candidates, if approved, on a competitive and profitable basis. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the Affordable Care Act and by other health care legislative reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future. In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that our potential third-party partners could receive for any of our drug candidates, if approved, and could adversely affect our profitability. We cannot predict how pending and future health care legislation will impact our business, and any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our drug candidates could harm our business.\nForeign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region, and we cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to our drug candidates, if approved, under any foreign reimbursement system. In some foreign countries, including major markets in the European Union and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take up to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a pharmacoeconomic study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidate to other available therapies. Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain. Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our drug candidates, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any of our drug candidates that we may develop and are commercialized by our potential third-party partners or impact any commercial products that we have previously sold or are being sold by third-party partners.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in human clinical trials and an even greater risk relating to any of our commercial products that we have previously sold or are being sold by third-party partners. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our commercial products that we have previously sold or are being sold by third-party partners or drug candidates caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for any drug candidates that we may develop and are commercialized by our potential third-party partners;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards paid to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u00b7\nour inability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates.\nWe currently hold $10 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may need to increase our insurance coverage and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe engage CROs to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct those clinical trials. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to timely enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, any third parties conducting our clinical trials will not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to earn revenue from those partnerships could be delayed significantly.\nSwitching or adding CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and generally do not control their activities. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for\nconducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, European Medicines Agency or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process for our potential third-party partners.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our drug candidates or commercialization of our drug candidates, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and supply of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our drug candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. For example, we have entered into an exclusive, ten-year, automatically renewable supply agreement with PeroxyChem, a manufacturer of hydrogen peroxide, to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient that is used in A-101 45% Topical Solution for the potential treatment of common warts. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our drug candidates at an acceptable cost and/or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our ability to timely conduct our clinical trials or our other development efforts.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after the NDA or comparable marketing application is submitted to the FDA or other regulatory authority. We do not have control over a supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s compliance with laws, regulations and applicable cGMP standards and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental health and safety matters. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our drug candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which could significantly impact our ability to develop, and identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize, our drug candidates.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u00b7\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u00b7\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u00b7\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u00b7\nthe possible increase in costs by our third-party suppliers for the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our drug candidates; and\n\u00b7\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension\nor withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our drug candidates.\nOur drug candidates may compete with other products and drug candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our drug candidates.\nIf our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. We may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for the active pharmaceutical ingredients and/or drug product for our drug candidates.\nWe expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our drug candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe intend to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. If those arrangements are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these drug candidates.\nWe intend to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates. For example, we intend to seek a partner to obtain marketing approval and commercialize A-101 45% Topical Solution as a potential treatment for common warts and a partner to further develop, obtain marketing approval and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502 as potential treatments for alopecia. Our likely partners for any such arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our partners dedicate to the development or commercialization of our drug candidates. Our ability to earn revenue from these arrangements will depend on our partners\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nPartnerships involving our drug candidates would pose the following risks to us:\n\u00b7\npartners have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these arrangements;\n\u00b7\npartners may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7\npartners may not pursue development, marketing approval or commercialization of any drug candidates that achieve marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the partners\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7\npartners may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\npartners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our drug candidates if the partners believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7\ndrug candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own products or drug candidates, which may cause our partners to cease to devote resources to the development and/or commercialization of our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\na partner with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our drug candidates that achieve marketing approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such drug candidates;\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development or commercialization, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u00b7\npartners may not properly maintain or defend our or their intellectual property rights or may use our or their proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate such intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\npartners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u00b7\npartnerships may be terminated for the convenience of the partner and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development and/or commercialization of the applicable drug candidates.\nPartnership agreements may not lead to development, marketing approval or commercialization of drug candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future partner of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our drug development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish partnerships, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs for our drug candidates will require substantial additional capital. For some of our drug candidates, we intend to partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the further development and/or commercialization of those drug candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a partnership will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed arrangement and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The partner may also consider alternative drug candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to partner on and whether such a partnership could be more attractive than the one with us for our drug candidate. Partnerships are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future partners.\nWe may not be able to negotiate partnerships on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of such drug candidate, or reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our drug candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue.\nWe may not have access to all information regarding our drug candidates that are subject to partnership agreements. Consequently, our ability to inform our stockholders about the status of our drug candidates that are subject to these agreements, and our ability to make business and operational decisions, may be limited.\nWe may not have access to all information regarding our drug candidates that may become subject to agreements with partners, including potentially material information about clinical trial design, execution and timing, safety and efficacy, clinical trial results, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other areas known by our potential partners. In addition, we may have confidentiality obligations under our agreements with such partners. Therefore, our ability to keep our stockholders informed about the status of our drug candidates will be limited by the degree to which our partners keep us informed and by the degree to which our partners allow us to disclose information to the public or\nprovide such information to the public themselves. If our partners do not timely inform us about the status of our drug candidates that are the subject of the partnership, we may make operational and investment decisions that we would not have made had we been fully informed, which may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon EPI Health for the commercialization of RHOFADE, and if we successfully pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop and/or commercialize our drug candidates and ESKATA, we will be dependent on the success of such third-party partners.\nIn October 2019, we sold the worldwide rights to RHOFADE to EPI Health. Among other payment obligations, EPI Health has agreed to pay us potential sales milestone payments of up to $20.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified levels of net sales, a specified high single-digit royalty calculated as a percentage of net sales, and 25% of any upfront, license, milestone, maintenance or fixed payment received by EPI Health in connection with any license or sublicense of the assets transferred in any territory outside of the United States, subject to specified exceptions. We also intend to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain regulatory approval and/or commercialize our drug candidates and ESKATA. We cannot control the timing or quantity of resources that our existing or future potential third-party partners will dedicate to developing and/or commercializing these products and drug candidates. Our partners may not perform their obligations according to our expectations or standards of quality. Our partners could terminate our existing agreements for a number of reasons, including that they may have other, higher priority products in development or because our partnered programs may no longer be a priority for them. If any of our partnership agreements were to be terminated or if any of our partners do not perform as expected, we could lose the opportunity to earn any revenues from the arrangements with such third-party partners, incur unforeseen costs, and suffer damage to the reputation of the product and as a company generally.\nOur sublease could terminate if the master lease is terminated for any reason, thus terminating our rights to our corporate headquarters.\nWe sublease space for our corporate headquarters. While the term of the sublease extends until October 2023, if for any reason the master lease is terminated or expires prior to October 2023, our sublease will also automatically terminate. In such an event, we would need to obtain a new direct lease with the master landlord or negotiate and enter into a new lease for office space at a different location, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our drug candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and ability to successfully identify a potential third-party partner to commercialize our technology and drug candidates may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our drug candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our drug candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, however, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or vice versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the\nUnited States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or drug candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drug candidates. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drug candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in the inability of our potential third-party partners to manufacture or commercialize our drug candidates without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications that we own, or license is threatened, it could dissuade companies from partnering with us to license, develop and/or commercialize our drug candidates.\nEven if our patent applications that we own or license issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or our potential third-party partners or otherwise provide us or our potential third-party partners with any competitive advantage. Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or drugs in a non-infringing manner. For example, the patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from Columbia University that are primarily directed to methods of treating hair loss disorders with JAK inhibitors have issued and may issue with claims directed to the use of specific JAK inhibitors that we do not intend to develop or commercialize or may not issue with claims directed to the use of JAK inhibitors that our competitors may commercialize.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit the ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drug candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drug candidates. Our issued U.S. patents covering our lead inhibitor of the MK2 signaling pathway, ATI-450, expire in 2034 and other issued patents covering different MK2 signaling pathway inhibitors expire in 2031 and 2032. We currently do not have any patents issued directed to our lead soft-JAK inhibitor, ATI-1777, but any claims that may issue would expire in 2038. We currently do not have any patents issued directed to our lead ITK inhibitor, ATI-2138, but any claims that may issue would expire in 2039. Our issued patents covering other novel inhibitors of ITK expire between 2035 and 2038. Certain issued U.S. patents relating to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are scheduled to expire in 2023 and additional U.S. patents, with claims specifically directed to such JAK inhibitors, are scheduled to expire in 2030. The issued U.S., European, Japanese and South Korean patents that we exclusively license from Columbia University with claims directed to the use of third-party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth, expire in 2031. Our issued U.S. patents, with claims directed to treatment of SK and acrochordons with high-concentration hydrogen peroxide of at least 23%, including ESKATA, are scheduled to expire in 2022, and our issued U.S. patents with claims directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including A-101 45% Topical Solution and ESKATA, and methods of use and applicators for the same are scheduled to expire in 2035. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us or our potential third-party partners with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from\nsuch applications. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or insufficient written description. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar administrative proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our drug candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would harm our business.\nIn such a proceeding, a court or administrative board may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology. An adverse result in any such proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may find it impractical or undesirable to enforce our intellectual property against some third parties. For instance, we are aware of third parties that have marketed high-concentration hydrogen peroxide solutions over the internet for the treatment of warts. These parties do not appear to have regulatory authority, and we have not authorized them in any way to market these products. However, to date we have refrained from seeking to enforce our intellectual property rights against these third parties due to the transient nature of their activities.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWith respect to ATI-501 and ATI-502, if we do not elect to exercise our first right to do so, Rigel may enforce the licensed patents relating to ATI-501 and ATI-502 against any infringing third party in the field of dermatology. In addition, Rigel has the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the licensed patents relating to ATI-501 and ATI-502 against any infringing party outside of the field of dermatology. With respect to the licensed patents from Columbia University, Columbia University has the first right to initiate, control and defend any proceedings related to the validity, enforceability or infringement of the licensed patent rights and in doing so, has no obligation to assert more than one licensed patent in one jurisdiction against a third party. With respect to the licensed patents from Columbia University, if Columbia University does not elect to exercise its first right to do so, we may enforce the licensed patent rights relating to an infringement of the licensed patent rights against any infringing third party.\nIf we breach our license agreement with Rigel, it could compromise our ability to identify and consummate transactions with potential third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rigel, which grants us the rights to certain patent rights and other intellectual property owned by them relating to the JAK inhibitors ATI-501 and ATI-502 in the field of dermatology. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under this license agreement, including failure to make payments to Rigel when due or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to find a third party to develop and commercialize a JAK inhibitor, Rigel has the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed Rigel\u2019s patent rights and other intellectual property would end, which would negatively impact our ability to find a potential third-party partner to develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502.\nIf we breach our agreement with the Selling Stockholders of Vixen, it could compromise our ability to identify and consummate transactions with potential third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502.\nIn March 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the stockholders of Vixen, pursuant to which we purchased all of the stock of Vixen and assumed its license agreement with Columbia University. If we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a JAK inhibitor for alopecia, the license agreement with Columbia University will be transferred to the Selling Stockholders of Vixen following any adverse resolution of any dispute relating thereto. Upon the effective date of such transfer, our right to practice the licensed Columbia University patent rights and know-how would end, which would negatively impact our ability to find a potential third-party partner to develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502.\nIf we breach our agreement with Columbia University, it could compromise our ability to find a potential third-party partner to develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502.\nIn March 2016, as part of the Vixen acquisition, we assumed a license agreement with Columbia University, which grants us the right under certain patent rights and know-how owned by Columbia University relating to the use of JAK inhibitors to treat hair-loss disorders. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under this license agreement, including failure to make payments to Columbia University when due and failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product, Columbia University has the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed Columbia University patent rights and know-how would end, which would negatively impact our ability to find a potential third-party partner to develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our drug candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. For example, the use of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of warts is currently covered by issued patents in the United States, Australia, India and New Zealand, but not in the European Union or other countries. An additional four U.S. patents are issued, and patent applications are pending in the United States, the European Union and other foreign countries directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including ESKATA and/or A-101 45% Topical Solution and methods of use.\nOur lead inhibitor of the MK2 signaling pathway, ATI-450, is currently covered in patents and applications in the United States, European Union and other major foreign markets. We currently do not have any patents issued directed to our lead soft-JAK inhibitor, ATI-1777, or our lead ITK inhibitor, ATI-2138. Our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are currently covered in patents and applications in the United States, the European Union, and other major foreign markets. Additionally, U.S., European, Japanese, and South Korean patents have issued in the patent portfolio licensed from Columbia University, which are directed to the use of certain third-party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders and applications are pending in the United States and South Korea.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nMany countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with potential third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates, and consequently our potential revenue opportunities.\nAccordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development and/or commercialization of our drug candidates. For example, we exclusively license intellectual property from Rigel in the field of dermatology related to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502. We also exclusively license intellectual property from Columbia University related to the use of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders. It may be necessary for our potential third-party partners to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to further develop and/or commercialize our drug candidates. If our potential third-party partners are not able to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nOur third-party licensors may develop JAK inhibitors, including those related to our drug candidates, outside of the field of dermatology.\nWe exclusively license intellectual property from Rigel in order to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502 in the field of dermatology. Rigel has retained the rights under such intellectual property to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502 outside of the field of dermatology. If Rigel were to commercialize such JAK inhibitors outside the field of dermatology, such a product could possibly be used off-label for a dermatology indication, which could negatively impact our ability to identify and consummate transactions with third-party partners to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize those drug candidates for dermatological indications, which in turn would impact our ability to earn revenue from the arrangements with such third-party partners. Rigel also retained the intellectual property rights to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize other structurally similar JAK inhibitors. If Rigel commercializes a structurally similar JAK inhibitor, such a product could directly compete with our JAK inhibitor drug candidates, if they are approved.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur success depends upon our ability to pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with potential third-party partners, to develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates and earn revenue from those partnerships, and for our proprietary technologies to be used without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our drug candidates and technologies, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing our drug candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we or our potential third-party partners are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we or such partners could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing or commercializing our drug candidates and technology. However, we or our third-party partners may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we or our third-party partner were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us or our partner. Consequently, we or our third-party partner could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing or commercializing the infringing technology or drug candidate. In addition, we or our third-party partner could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we or such partner are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent our third-party partners from commercializing our drug candidates, if approved, or force such partners to cease some of their business operations. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us or our potential third-party partners, we or our third-party partners may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing drug candidate or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we, our employees or our licensors have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we and our licensors try to ensure that our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we or our licensors may be subject to claims that these employees, our licensors or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we or our licensors fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we and our licensors are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace, including compromising our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, or pursue strategic alternatives, including identifying and consummating transactions with third-party partners, to further develop, obtain marketing approval for and/or commercialize our drug candidates.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking and maintaining patents for our drug candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using\nthat technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nThe validity, scope and enforceability of any of our patents that cover any of our commercial products or any of our drug candidates can be challenged by competitors.\nThe likelihood that a third party will challenge the patents covering a commercial product is increased because it is a marketed product. The challenge may come in the form of a patent office proceeding, such as an inter partes review, challenging the validity of the patents or a district court proceeding, such as a paragraph IV litigation arising out of the filing of an ANDA.\nIf a third party files an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a generic of a commercial product, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1) there is no patent information listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book with respect to our NDA for the applicable approved drug; (2) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3) the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third party's generic drug. A certification that the new drug will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for the applicable approved drug, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third party\u2019s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third party\u2019s ANDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third party\u2019s ANDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay of FDA approval. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management's attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our commercial products.\nOn October 8, 2019, we, together with Allergan, Inc., filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Taro Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Taro, related to an ANDA that Taro filed with the FDA to market a generic version of RHOFADE. The lawsuit claims infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,812,049, 8,420,688, 8,815,929, 9,974,773 and 10,335,391, which are listed in the FDA\u2019s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, for RHOFADE. We received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter from Taro dated August 28, 2019, advising that Taro had submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking approval from the FDA to manufacture and market a generic version of RHOFADE prior to the expiration of the Orange Book-listed patents. EPI Health, as purchaser of our rights to RHOFADE, has been substituted for us as a plaintiff party. If EPI Health is not able to successfully defend the RHOFADE intellectual property and a generic version of RHOFADE is approved, our ability to earn revenue from EPI Health through the achievement of sales milestones, licensing in jurisdictions outside of the United States and/or royalty payments would be negatively impacted.\nIf any of our drug candidates advance through development or are approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the current patents, or patents that may issue in the future, within our portfolio covering these drug candidates. Any such challenge could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims or a finding of non-infringement.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act by extending the patent term and obtaining data exclusivity for our drug candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur success will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology, drug candidates and our target indications. Our issued U.S. patents covering ATI-450, our lead inhibitor of the MK2 signaling pathway, expire in 2034 and other issued patents covering different MK2 signaling pathway inhibitors expire in 2031 and 2032. We currently do not have any patents issued directed to our lead soft-JAK inhibitor, ATI-1777, but any claims that may issue would expire in 2038. We currently do not have any patents issued directed to our lead ITK inhibitor, ATI-2138, but any claims that may issue would expire in 2039. Our issued patents covering other novel inhibitors of ITK expire between 2035 and 2038. Certain issued U.S. patents relating to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are scheduled to expire in 2023 and\nadditional U.S. patents, with claims specifically directed to such JAK inhibitors, are scheduled to expire in 2030. The issued U.S., European, Japanese and South Korean patents licensed from Columbia University relating to the use of certain third-party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth, expire in 2031. Our issued U.S. patent with claims directed to treatment of SK with ESKATA is scheduled to expire in 2022 and our issued U.S. formulation and applicator patents with claims directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations and applicators containing the same, including A-101 45% Topical Solution and ESKATA, and methods of use is scheduled to expire in 2035. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting our drug candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates begin to be commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our drug candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, for a drug candidate. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent extension term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent as compensation for patent term lost during development and the FDA regulatory review process, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). However, the total patent term including the period of extension cannot exceed 14 years from the product\u2019s approval date. Furthermore, this extension is limited to only one patent per regulatory review period that covers the approved product. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request.\nIf we are unable to extend the expiration date of our existing patents or obtain new patents with longer expiry dates, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data to obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nAny trademarks we have obtained or may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish our products, services or technologies from those of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, our products, services or technologies may need to be rebranded, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nOutside of the United States we cannot be certain that any country\u2019s patent or trademark office will not implement new rules that could seriously affect how we draft, file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications.\nWe cannot be certain that the patent or trademark offices of countries outside the United States will not implement new rules that increase costs for drafting, filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications or that any such new rules will not restrict our ability to file for patent protection. For example, we may elect not to seek patent protection in some jurisdictions or for some drug candidates in order to save costs. We may be forced to abandon or return the rights to specific patents due to a lack of financial resources.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make formulations or compositions that are the same as or similar to A-101 45% Topical Solution and ESKATA but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own;\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make a JAK inhibitor that is similar to the JAK inhibitors we intend to partner that is not covered by the patents that we exclusively license and have the right to enforce;\n\u00b7\nwe, our licensors or any third-party partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own;\n\u00b7\nwe, our licensors or any third-party partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nissued patents that we own or exclusively license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u00b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in major commercial markets; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Drug Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf our potential third-party partners are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, our drug candidates will not be able to be commercialized, and our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners will be materially impaired.\nOur drug candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the European Commission and EU Member State Competent Authorities and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a drug candidate will prevent our potential third-party partners from commercializing the drug candidate. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the drug candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the drug manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our drug candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our potential third-party partners from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If any of our drug candidates receive marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our product in this way, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted drug application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a drug candidate. Any marketing approval our potential third-party partners ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved drug not commercially viable.\nIf our potential third-party partners experience delays in obtaining approval or if they fail to obtain approval of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects for our drug candidates may be harmed and our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our drug candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our drugs in the European Union and any other jurisdictions, our potential third-party partners must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. Our potential third-party partners may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may impact our potential third-party partners\u2019 ability to obtain approval elsewhere. Our potential third-party partners may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our drug candidates in any market.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our drug candidates by our potential third-party partners internationally could harm our business.\nIf our drug candidates are marketed internationally by our potential third-party partners, if approved, our potential third-party partners would be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u00b7\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nthe potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\nforeign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u00b7\npotential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u00b7\nlogistical challenges resulting from distributing our drug candidates to foreign countries; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with international operations may compromise our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with potential third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nAny drug candidate for which our potential third-party partners obtain marketing approval could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and our potential third-party partners may be subject to penalties if they fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if they experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny drug candidate for which our potential third-party partners obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such drug candidate, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These\nrequirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a drug candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. If any of our drug candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug, which could limit sales of the drug by our potential third-party partners.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the drug. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if our potential third-party partners do not market our drugs for their approved indications, they may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may have negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on such drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on drug distribution or use;\n\u00b7\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\nrecall or withdrawal of the drugs from the market;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u00b7\nclinical holds;\n\u00b7\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u00b7\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our drugs;\n\u00b7\ndrug seizure; or\n\u00b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNon-compliance with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of drugs for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. These and other risks associated with the failure by our potential third-party partners to comply with regulatory requirements may compromise our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nOur potential third-party partners\u2019 relationships with third-party payors, health care professionals and customers in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other health care laws and regulations, and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nHealth care providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any of our drug candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Our potential third-party partners\u2019 arrangements with third-party payors, health care professionals and customers may expose them to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal civil False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which they sell, market and distribute any drug candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. In addition, we and our potential third-party partners may be subject to transparency laws and patient\nprivacy regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we or they conduct business. The applicable federal, state and foreign health care laws and regulations that may affect our or our potential third-party partners\u2019 ability to operate include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The intent standard was further amended by the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil False Claims Act (that can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions), and the civil monetary penalties law, which impose criminal and civil penalties, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nfederal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act) and its implementing regulations, which requires specified manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics or medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians, which is defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and teaching hospitals, as well as applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. All such reported information is publicly available; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to health care providers; state, local and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report pricing information regarding certain drugs; and/or that require registration of certain employees engaged in marketing activities in the location; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our or our potential third-party partners\u2019 business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable health care laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our or our potential third-party partners\u2019 business practices, including relationships with physicians and other health care providers, some of whom may recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our drug candidates,\nif approved, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other health care laws and regulations. By way of example, some of our consulting arrangements with physicians may not meet all of the criteria of the personal services safe harbor under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Accordingly, they may not qualify for safe harbor protection from government prosecution. A business arrangement that does not substantially comply with a safe harbor, however, is not necessarily illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but may be subject to additional scrutiny by the government.\nIf our or our potential third-party partners\u2019 operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us or them, we or our potential third-party partners may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we or they become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our or their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates. If any physician or other health care provider or entity with whom we or our potential third-party partners expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government health care programs, which could also materially affect our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for our potential third-party partners to obtain marketing approval of our drug candidates and commercialize our drug candidates, if approved, and affect the prices our potential third-party partners may obtain.\nIn the United States, and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our potential third-party partners\u2019 ability to profitably sell any of our drug candidates for which our potential third-party partners obtain marketing approval, and consequently affect our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nAmong policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. The Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in 2010, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nAmong the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to commercial products are the following:\n\u00b7\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government health care programs;\n\u00b7\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, which include, among other things, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;\n\u00b7\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u00b7\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u00b7\nthe new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations;\n\u00b7\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u00b7\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nThere remain judicial and Congressional challenges to, as well as efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the 2017 Tax Act, includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminates, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the 2017 Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act. We continue to evaluate the impact of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that became effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law in January 2013, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any similar new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with our potential third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that our potential third-party partners receive for any approved drug candidate. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other health care reforms may prevent our potential third-party partners from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drug candidates, if approved, which in turn may impact our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient\nprograms, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump Administration\u2019s budget proposals for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump Administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal health care programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their drugs, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has solicited feedback on some of these measures and, has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS\u2019 policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. While some of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have both stated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on obtaining marketing approvals for our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject our potential third-party partners to more stringent drug labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. These risks may compromise our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenue.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, our potential third-party partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidate to other available procedures. If reimbursement of our drug candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our potential third-party partners may not able to generate revenue, which in turn may adversely affect our ability to earn revenue from arrangements with such third-party partners for our drug candidates.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our development or manufacturing efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nThe inherent dangers in production and transportation of hydrogen peroxide could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in the use and transport of hydrogen peroxide, the active ingredient in A-101 45% Topical Solution. Hydrogen peroxide can decompose in the presence of organic materials and is categorized as an oxidizer and is corrosive. Hydrogen peroxide should be stored in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas and away from any flammable or combustible substances. The hazards and risks associated with producing and transporting hydrogen peroxide include fires, explosions, third-party interference (including terrorism) and mechanical failure of equipment at our facilities or those of our supplier of hydrogen peroxide. The occurrence of any of these events could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to properties.\nWe are subject to governmental economic sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our potential third-party partners\u2019 ability to compete in international markets or subject us or our potential third-party partners to liability if we or they are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nAs a U.S. company, we are subject to U.S. import and export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations, and we are required to import and export our drug candidates, technology and services in compliance with those laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic embargo and trade sanction programs administered by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nU.S. economic sanctions and export control laws and regulations prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we are currently taking precautions to prevent doing any business, directly or indirectly, with countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions and to ensure that our drug candidates, are not exported or used by countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions, such measures may be circumvented.\nFurthermore, if we or our third-party partners export our drug candidates, the exports may require authorizations, including a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorization. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Failure to comply with export control and sanctions regulations may expose us or our potential third-party partners to government investigations and penalties.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or import or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, including possible incarceration for those individuals responsible for the violations, the loss of export or import privileges and reputational harm.\nWe and our potential third-party partners are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our and their operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe and our potential third-party partners are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We or our potential third-party partners may engage third-party intermediaries in connection with the development or commercialization of our drug candidates and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. We, our potential third-party partners or the third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting\nwith certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, development, clinical, financial, legal and business development expertise of Dr. Neal Walker, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. David Gordon, our Chief Medical Officer, Frank Ruffo, our Chief Financial Officer, and Kamil Ali-Jackson, our Chief Legal Officer, as well as the other members of our scientific and clinical teams. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, each of them may currently terminate their employment with us or resign at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our key executives other than for Dr. Walker.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, manufacturing and clinical personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop and partner drug candidates. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, third-party partners, principal investigators, CROs and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, third-party partners, principal investigators, CROs and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state health care laws and regulations, and laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements by our potential third-party partners in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we are subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our shares will be sustained. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell the shares at all.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe commencement, enrollment or results of any clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nany delay in our regulatory filings for any of our drug candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information;\n\u00b7\nadverse results from, delays in or termination of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure of any of our drug candidates to receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of any drug candidate or previously sold commercial product;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nstock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biotechnology industry;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u00b7\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u00b7\ngeneral political and economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. For example, two purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our executive officers alleging violations of certain federal securities laws and two stockholder derivative actions were filed against certain of our executive officers and directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties. We and the other defendants dispute the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and intend to defend these matters vigorously. We have entered into indemnity agreements with our executive officers and directors which provide, among other things, that we will indemnify such officer or director, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements he or she may be required to pay in actions or proceedings which he or she is or may be made a party by reason of his or her position as our director, officer or other agent, and otherwise to the fullest\nextent permitted under Delaware law and our bylaws. These cases, and additional litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market, we may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, either: (i) a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $5 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $10 million; or (ii) a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors, affiliates and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $15 million and a total market value of listed securities of at least $50.0 million.\nWe may fail to satisfy one or more Nasdaq Global Market requirements for continued listing of our common stock in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market, or, if transferred, on the Nasdaq Capital Market. This could impair the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock from a national exchange could have a material adverse effect on our access to capital markets, and any limitation on market liquidity or reduction in the price of our common stock as a result of that delisting could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. Equity research analysts may elect not to initiate or continue to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Even if we have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plan or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plan or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering the issuance of shares of common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Shares registered under these registration statements are available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options, and the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act in the case of our affiliates.\nAdditionally, certain holders of shares of our common stock, or their transferees, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to register the resale of these shares, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change of control was considered favorable by some or all of our stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u00b7\nonly one of our three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u00b7\nstockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 66 2/3% vote and only for cause;\n\u00b7\nstockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u00b7\nstockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nstockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:\n\u00b7\nbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure in this report;\n\u00b7\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and\n\u00b7\nnot being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We currently expect that we will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2020.\nWe also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we benefit from some of the same scaled disclosure requirements.\nUnder Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the stock market on which our common stock is listed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This requires that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts.\nWe may identify weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the 2017 Tax Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the 2017 Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 Tax Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the 2017 Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $326.1 million and $338.8 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2032. Under federal income tax law, federal NOLs incurred in 2018 and later years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited. It is\nuncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal tax law. As of December 31, 2019, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.3 million which will begin to expire in 2032, and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $0.1 million which will begin to expire in 2022. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused or due to limitation on use be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have completed an analysis under Section 382 for NOLs generated from July 13, 2012 through December 31, 2018. Although we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes since 2012, we have concluded that we should have sufficient ability to utilize NOLs accumulated during the periods tested. We have not yet determined if a Section 382 ownership change has occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, or for Confluence prior to the acquisition. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it might harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur, and will continue to incur, particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d significant legal, accounting and other costs. These costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, this exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim\nin a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15775, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACRS"}
