{"cik": "1375557", "company": "Guidance Software, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties are described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.\nGlobal market and economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in global economic conditions, especially those in the US, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Economic conditions in the United States and worldwide macroeconomic conditions remained challenging during much of 2013, 2014 and 2015. If this economic weakness continues or worsens, customers may delay, reduce or forego technology purchases, both directly and through our channel partners and resellers. Delays in customer purchases in the future could lead to reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Further, deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay amounts owed to us. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from period to period and within each period, which makes our operating results difficult to predict and could cause our revenues, expenses and profitability to fall short of expectations during certain periods.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from period to period or within certain periods as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of future performance, as our operating results in the future may fall below expectations, expenses could increase and revenues could decrease. Each of the risks described in this section, as well as other factors, may affect our operating results. For example, our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our lengthy sales cycle, the proportion of revenues attributable to license fees versus services and maintenance revenues, changes in the level of fixed operating expenses, demand for our products and services, the introduction of new products and product enhancements or upgrades by us or our competitors, changes in customer budgets and capital expenditure plans, competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions. In addition, many customers make major software acquisitions near the end of their fiscal years, which tends to cause our revenues to be higher in the third and fourth calendar quarters which coincide with the fiscal year ends of many government agencies and corporations, and lower in the first and second calendar quarters. In addition, many customers tend to make software acquisitions or purchases near the end of a particular quarter, which tends to make our revenues for a particular period unpredictable for a significant portion of the period in question until software purchase decisions have been made. Since certain of our software sales are large scale license agreements, a short delay in just one of these software sales from one quarter into a subsequent quarter or a loss of one of these potential sales could cause us to deliver results for a quarter that are below projections of securities analysts that follow our results. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks, and we may not be profitable in any future period.\nIf the corporate market for digital investigation software does not continue to develop, we will not be able to grow, and our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe market for digital investigation software continues to evolve largely through our efforts. Our growth is dependent upon, among other things, the size and pace at which the market for such software develops. Our ability to achieve our anticipated growth rate may be impacted by a contraction in the global economy. If the market for such digital investigation software decreases, remains constant, or grows more slowly than we anticipate, we will not be able to maintain historical growth rates. Continued growth in the demand for our products is uncertain because of, among other things:\n\u00b7 customers and potential customers may decide to use traditional methods of conducting enterprise investigations, such as reliance on in-house professionals or outside consultants to conduct manual investigations;\n\u00b7 customers may experience technical difficulty in utilizing digital investigation software or otherwise not achieve their expected return on their investment in such software; and\n\u00b7 marketing efforts and publicity related to digital investigation software may not be successful.\nEven if digital investigation software gains wide market acceptance, our software may not adequately address market requirements and may not continue to gain market acceptance. If digital investigation software generally, or our software specifically, do not gain wide market acceptance, we may not be able to grow and our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to effectively manage and support our growth or retain and attract highly skilled employees, our business strategy might not succeed.\nIn the past we have grown rapidly and we will need to continue to grow in all areas of our operations to execute our business strategy. Managing and sustaining our growth will place significant demands on management as well as on our administrative, operational, technical and financial systems and controls and other resources. We may not be able to expand our product offerings, our customer base and markets, or implement other features of our business strategy at the rate or to the extent presently planned. In addition, our traditionally high level of customer service may suffer as we grow, which could cause our software sales to suffer. If we are unable to successfully manage or support our future growth, we may not be able to maximize revenues or profitability.\nIn addition, in order to be able to effectively execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We may need to hire personnel in virtually all operational areas, but primarily in selling and marketing, research and development, professional services, training and customer service. Competition in our industry for experienced and qualified personnel in these areas is extremely intense, especially for software developers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software products and sophisticated technical sales people experienced in selling our complex type of software products and selling into government agencies. In order to expand sales of our products, we may need to continue to hire highly qualified commissioned sales personnel to directly target potential customers. These new commissioned sales personnel require extensive training and experience before being able to effectively market our software products, and, as a result of these hires, our sales and marketing expense may increase at a greater rate than our revenues, at least in the short term. The expense of hiring and training these commissioned sales personnel may never generate a corresponding increase in revenue. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining the necessary qualified personnel that our growth plan requires. In the past we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nWe also believe that a critical contribution to our successful growth will be our corporate culture which fosters innovation, teamwork and excellence. As our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures and institutional programs, we may find it difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced personnel and therefore our future success in continuing to maintain our rapid growth.\nThe failure of the legal community to continue to adopt our eDiscovery solution could negatively affect future sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect to derive a significant amount of sales from our EnCase eDiscovery solution. However, widespread adoption of e-discovery best practices will require a shift in the way the legal community approaches discovery of electronic documents and other electronically stored data. Currently, most large scale electronic discovery projects are conducted by outsourced service providers that manually retrieve documents from each computer subject to review. These service providers have longstanding and entrenched relationships with the corporations that are subject to large-scale discovery inquiries or security breaches and the large law firms that are typically retained in connection with such discovery projects. Corporations and law firms may continue to prefer to use service providers because of these ongoing established relationships, and because the service providers are widely known and accepted within the legal community, and may resist adoption of our EnCase eDiscovery solution. Moreover, the expense of relying on an outsourced service provider may frequently be covered by the corporation\u2019s insurance policy that is otherwise covering the expense of the litigation, including complying with requests for discovery, while implementation of our EnCase eDiscovery would require a significant unreimbursed capital expenditure by the corporation. The failure of corporations and law firms to adopt our EnCase eDiscovery solution for e-discovery could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nCourts could reject the use of our products, which would harm our reputation and negatively affect future sales of our products and services.\nOur software products and services are often used in connection with legal investigations, civil litigation and criminal prosecutions. The admissibility of results generated by our products as evidence in civil and criminal trials is a key component of our customer value proposition. Evidence and the manner used to collect evidence is regularly the subject of challenges in legal investigations and litigation, and our products or personnel may be the direct or indirect subject of such legal challenges. Persons involved in litigation may, for example, challenge the reliability of our products, the admissibility of evidence generated, discovered or collected using our products, and/or the expertise, credibility or reliability of our personnel. Other unpredictable legal challenges may be brought that could reflect upon the reputation of our products or personnel. To date, courts that have addressed challenges to our products or services have ruled against such challenges. If in the future a court were to find that our products are not reliable or that persons representing us or users of our product are not credible, reliable or lack the expertise necessary to serve as a witness or to authenticate evidence, or that our training and certification process does not adequately prepare individuals to conduct competent digital investigations, this could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nA failure to attract and retain managerial, technical, and other key personnel could reduce our revenues and our operational effectiveness.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel, including without limitation, our existing research and development personnel. The loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business development, culture and strategic direction. The competition for attracting and retaining key employees is intense. Because of this competition, we may be unable to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future to keep up with our business demands and changes, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows could be materially adversely affected. The risks involved in recruiting and retaining these key personnel may be increased by our lack of profitability and the volatility of our stock price.\nChanges or reforms in the law or regulatory landscape could diminish the need for our solutions, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nOne factor that drives demand for our products and services is the legal and regulatory framework in which our customers operate. Laws and regulations are subject to changes that could either help or hurt the demand for our products. Thus, certain changes in the law and regulatory landscape, such as tort law or legislative reforms that limit the scope and size of electronic discovery requests or the admissibility of evidence generated by such requests, as well as court decisions, could significantly harm our business. Changes in domestic and international privacy laws could also affect the demand and acceptance of our products, and such changes could have a material impact on our revenues.\nWe face direct and indirect competition from other software companies, as well as other companies that provide incident response, consulting and certification services in computer forensics, which could limit our growth and market share.\nThe markets for our software products and services are competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapidly changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future as new companies enter our markets, existing competitors develop stronger capabilities and we expand into other markets. Many of our current competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases and substantially more extensive resources than we have. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs and achieve wider market acceptance. Because the barriers to entry into software industry segments are generally low, we expect to continue to face competition from new entrants, particularly as we expand into other segments of the software industry.\nSeveral competing companies provide digital investigation software and applications that directly compete or will compete with our products, or offer solutions our products do not address. In addition, if the market for digital investigation software develops as we anticipate, other companies could enter this market through their own software development or through the acquisition of one of our current competitors. If these companies are more successful in providing similar, better or less expensive digital investigation solutions compared to those that we offer, we could experience a decline in customers and revenues. These companies include computer forensic companies, managed security services companies and consulting companies, such as international consulting/accounting firms, many of which have substantially greater resources and customer bases than we do. If our competitors are more successful than we are at generating professional services engagements, our growth rate or revenues may decline.\nWe also compete with companies or organizations that have developed or are developing and marketing software and services that diminish the need for our solutions or the budget available to our customers to purchase our solutions. These companies include traditional security companies, data storage infrastructure and data archiving companies, information management, records management and internal IT organizations that develop their own solutions.\nComputer hackers may damage our products, services and systems, which could cause interruptions in our service and harm to our business and hackers could gain access to our customers\u2019 personal information which could result in the loss of existing clients, negative publicity and legal liability.\nComputer hackers often attempt to access information, including personal information for purposes of identity theft and other criminal activity. In particular, due to the nature of our business, the products and services that we offer and the industry in which we operate, we are more likely to be the target of computer hackers who would like to undermine our ability to offer the products and services that we provide to our customers and possibly retaliate for the results or evidence that our products and services generate.\nFor example, in December 2005, we became aware of a security breach of our electronic records which contained, among other things, credit card information of approximately 5,000 customers. We promptly notified law enforcement authorities as well as each of the customers whose information may have been compromised. We conducted a forensic examination of the incident and took a number of steps to both remediate the underlying cause and strengthen our internal security system, including enhancing our internal information technology security department and redesigning our network architecture.\nIn early January 2006, the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) commenced an inquiry into the December 2005 security breach. In September 2006, we executed a consent decree proposed by the FTC that includes no monetary penalties. The consent decree found that we failed to implement proper security measures to protect consumers\u2019 data, and requires us to provide the FTC with initial and biennial third-party assessments of our IT security for a period of 10 years. Additionally, the consent decree requires us to maintain a comprehensive IT security program, retain documentation of such program and provide notice of the consent decree to our\nexecutives and employees for a period of 20 years. The FTC formally approved the consent decree on November 15, 2006 and subsequently issued a press release announcing the investigation and its conclusion. In April 2007, we received formal notice and service of the decree from the FTC, effectively ending the inquiry. In 2007, we timely filed the first compliance report required by the consent decree. In 2011, 2013, and 2015, we timely complied with our biennial monitoring and reporting responsibilities required by the consent decree.\nGiven the incident, any subsequent breach of our security could be especially damaging to our reputation and business and may result in monetary penalties if the FTC were to find that the circumstances that lead to the breach constituted a violation of our obligations under the consent decree.\nIn addition, from time to time we may be the targets of computer hackers who, among other things, create viruses to sabotage or otherwise attack companies\u2019 networks, products and services. For example, there was recently a spread of viruses, or worms that intentionally deleted anti-virus and firewall software. Our products, networks, websites and systems, may be the target of attacks by hackers. If successful, any of these events could damage our computer systems, force us to incur substantial costs to fix technical problems or result in hackers gaining access to our technical and other proprietary information, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe complexity of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies, particularly those related to revenue recognition, could materially affect our financial results for a given period.\nAlthough we use standardized sales agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements, particularly in multi-product license and services transactions. As our transactions have increased in complexity, particularly with the sale of larger, multi-product licenses, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may require us to defer recognition of revenue on such licenses. We believe that we are in compliance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Software Industry-Revenue Recognition topic (ASC 985-605); however, more complex, multi-product license transactions require additional accounting analysis to account for them accurately. The professional technical guidance available regarding the application of software revenue recognition is very conceptual, and silent to specific implementation matters. As a consequence of this, we have been required to make assumptions and judgments, in certain circumstances, regarding the application of software revenue recognition. Incorrect assumptions or judgments as well as changes in, or clarification to accounting interpretations, could lead to unanticipated changes in our revenue accounting practices and may affect the timing of revenue recognition, which could adversely affect our financial results for any given period. If we discover that we have interpreted and applied revenue recognition rules differently than prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we could be required to devote significant management resources, and incur the expense associated with an audit, restatement or other examination of our financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d) jointly issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supercedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supercede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under US GAAP. The standard\u2019s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current authoritative guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The standard was originally effective beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted under US GAAP. However, on July 9, 2015, the FASB approved to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, beginning after December 15, 2017, with an option to adopt as of the original effective date, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the financial statement impact of the new standard.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nIn preparing our quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the foreign and domestic jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of current tax laws. Although we believe our judgments, assumptions and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known and could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes.\nDue to uncertainty in the application and interpretation of applicable state sales tax laws, we may be exposed to additional sales tax liability.\nThe Company\u2019s sales and use tax filings are subject to customary audits by authorities in the jurisdictions where it conducts business in the United States, which may result in assessments of additional taxes. In March 2011, we determined that additional sales taxes were probable of being assessed by a certain state as a result of the preliminary findings specific to a sales and use tax audit. The assessment including interest is approximately $1.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The estimated incremental sales and use tax liability was based on a similar model that was being used by the state conducting the sales and use tax audit. Should other states where we have not imposed sales and use taxes determine that the sale of our products or services are subject to sales and use taxes, we could incur future assessments, which would require charges to operations.\nOur operating results and business would be seriously impaired if our revenues from our software product offerings, which include EnCase Endpoint Security and EnCase eDiscovery, were to decline.\nHistorically, we have derived substantially all of our license revenues from sales of our EnCase product offerings. Although we have introduced new software modules, we expect that our EnCase product offerings will account for the largest portion of our software product revenue for the foreseeable future. We believe that the degree of penetration for our EnCase Forensic product in the law enforcement market makes it unlikely that revenue from sales of EnCase Forensic will contribute dramatically to future revenue growth. For this reason, we are dependent on increased sales of our EnCase Endpoint Security and eDiscovery product offerings to drive future growth.\nAs a result, if for any reason revenue from our EnCase product offerings declines further or does not increase as anticipated, our operating results and our prospects for growth will be significantly impaired. Further, if these products fail to meet the needs of our existing and target customers, or if they do not compare favorably in price and performance to competing products, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize indirect sales channels, such as value-added resellers, corporate resellers, professional services firms and other third-party distributors for the sale and distribution of our products, which may limit our ability to expand our customer base and our revenues.\nWe may be limited in our ability to market and distribute our products through value-added resellers, corporate resellers, professional services firms and other third-party distributors, which we collectively refer to as third-party resellers, due to various factors. Due to the complex nature of our products, sales professionals generally require a significant amount of time and effort to become sufficiently familiar with our products in order to be able to market them effectively, which makes our products unattractive to third-party resellers. In addition, our competitors include professional services organizations, such as accounting, consulting and law firms, that would otherwise serve as a natural distribution channel for our products and related services.\nMoreover, there is significant competition in our industry for qualified third-party resellers. Even if we were to succeed in attracting qualified and capable third-party resellers, agreements with such third-party resellers are generally renewable annually, are not exclusive and contain no minimum purchase commitments. Such agreements may be terminated by either party: (a) for U.S. and Canadian resellers, with 30 days written notice after the initial one-year period; and (b) for non-U.S. or Canadian resellers, within 30 days after the initial six-month period of the agreement, and with 30 days\u2019 notice after the initial one-year period. If we are not able to recruit new qualified third-party resellers, our sales growth may be constrained and our results of operations would suffer.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and if we are unable to protect our proprietary technologies and defend infringement claims, we could lose our competitive advantage and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and services and to defend against infringement claims. If we are unable to do so, our business and financial results may be adversely affected. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret law, confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees, customers and other third parties, software security measures, and registered copyrights, trademarks and patents. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. Any of our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation proceedings. In addition, we may be unable to obtain patent, copyright or trademark protection on products that we spend significant time and expense to develop in the future. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, unauthorized persons may be able to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise use some of our proprietary\ntechnology. Furthermore, existing patent and copyright laws may afford only limited protection, and the laws of certain countries in which we operate do not protect proprietary technology as well as established law in the United States. For these reasons, we may have difficulty protecting our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use. If any of these events happen, there could be a material adverse effect on the value of our proprietary technology and on our business and financial results. In addition, litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology. This type of litigation is often costly and time-consuming, with no assurance of success.\nClaims that we misuse the intellectual property of others could subject us to significant legal liability and disrupt our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the nature of our business, we may become subject to material claims of infringement by competitors and other third parties with respect to our current or future software applications, trademarks or other proprietary rights. The legal framework for software patents is rapidly evolving and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of software applications and competitors in our industry segment grows. In certain circumstances, the owners of proprietary software could make copyright and/or patent infringement claims against us in connection with such activity. Any such claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming and difficult to defend against, result in costly litigation, cause shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties, which may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable, if at all. Any of these claims could disrupt our business, make it difficult to add or retain important features in our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of intellectual property claims that have recently been asserted against us, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cNote 13 - Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we are unable to continue to obtain government licenses, approvals or authorizations regarding the export of our products abroad, or if current or future export laws limit or otherwise restrict our business, we could be prohibited from shipping our products to certain countries, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with United States laws regulating the export of our products to other countries. Our products contain encryption and decryption technologies that require us to obtain certain licenses from the United States government in order to export certain of our products abroad. In addition, we are required to obtain licenses from foreign governments in order to import our products into these countries. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining such licenses, approvals and other authorizations required from applicable governmental authorities to export our products. The export regimes and the governing policies applicable to our business are subject to change, and we cannot assure you that such export approvals or authorizations will be available to us or for our products in the future. Our failure to receive any required export license, approval or authorization would hinder our ability to sell our products and could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur software applications may be perceived as, or determined by the courts to be, a violation of privacy rights. Any such perception or determination could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nBecause of the nature of digital investigations, our potential customers and purchasers of our products or the public in general may perceive that use of our products for these investigations result in violations of individual privacy rights. In addition, certain courts, legislative and regulatory authorities could determine that the use of our software solutions or similar products is a violation of privacy rights, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the United States. Any such determination or perception by potential customers, the general public, government entities or the judicial system could harm our reputation and adversely affect the sales of our products and our results of operations.\nOur business depends, in part, on sales to governments and governmental entities and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of governments and governmental entities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from contracts with federal, state, local and foreign governments and government agencies, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived approximately 13.8% of our revenues from the sales of products and services from the U.S. Government. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, our business was adversely affected by government budgeting constraints. Changes in government contracting policies or additional or continued government budgetary constraints could directly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Among the factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are:\n\u00b7 changes in fiscal policies or decreases in available government funding;\n\u00b7 changes in government programs or applicable requirements;\n\u00b7 the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations;\n\u00b7 changes in political or social attitudes with respect to security issues, computer crimes, discovery of computer files and digital investigations;\n\u00b7 potential delays or changes in the government appropriations process; and\n\u00b7 delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices.\nThese and other factors could cause governments and governmental agencies to refrain from purchasing the products and services that we offer in the future, the result of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of our government customers are subject to stringent budgetary constraints. The award of additional contracts from government agencies could be adversely affected by spending reductions or budget cutbacks at government agencies that currently use or are likely to utilize our products and services.\nBecause we offer our EnScript programming language for customization of and the creation of add-ons for EnCase, customers or third-party programmers may be able to develop products that compete with our products or reduce the marketability or value of our products.\nWe have developed many of our major products, including EnCase Endpoint Security and EnCase eDiscovery, to function as applications running on the EnCase platform. In order to enhance the attractiveness of EnCase to potential customers and position EnCase as a standard software for digital investigations, we have made available without charge the EnScript programming language, which permits users of EnCase to develop customized add-on features for their own or others\u2019 use, and we have trained our customers on how to write add-on programs using the EnScript programming language, which is similar to Java or C++. As part of this strategy, we have encouraged the development of an active community of EnScript programmers similar to those which have emerged for other software products. While we believe widespread use of our EnScript programming language will ultimately create demand for our products, customers in the past have developed, and may in the future develop, software for use with EnCase using the EnScript programming language, rather than purchasing certain of our product offerings. Losses of sales to potential customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to develop new products and enhance our existing products. Failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products to the market may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to develop enhancements to our existing products and to introduce new products that keep pace with rapid technological developments and changes in customers\u2019 needs. Although our products are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms, we must continue to modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in network platforms, operating systems, software technology and changing customer demands. We may not be successful in developing and documenting these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely manner. Any failure of our products to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and result in customer dissatisfaction.\nFurthermore, any new products that we develop may not be released in a timely manner and may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate significant sales revenues. As a result, we may expend significant time and expense towards research and development for new or enhanced products, which may not gain market acceptance or generate sufficient sales to offset the costs of research and development. If we are unable to successfully develop new products or enhance and improve our existing products, or if we fail to position or price our products to meet market demand, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nErrors in our products could adversely affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us, impair our ability to market our products and expose us to legal liability, any of which may adversely affect our operating results.\nProducts as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or failures. Despite extensive testing by us and by our customers, we have in the past discovered errors in our software applications and will likely continue to do so in the future. As a result of past discovered errors, we experienced delays and lost revenues while we corrected the problems in those software applications. In addition, customers in the past have brought to our attention \u201cbugs\u201d in our software exposed by the customers\u2019 unique operating environments. Although we have been able to fix these software bugs in the past, we may not always be able to do so in the future. In addition, our products may also be subject to intentional attacks by viruses that seek to take advantage of these bugs, errors or other\nweaknesses. Any of these events may result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and services, which would seriously harm our sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we believe that our reputation and name recognition are critical factors in our ability to compete and generate additional sales of our products and services. Promotion and enhancement of our brand name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective software applications and services. The occurrence of errors in our software applications or the detection of bugs by our customers may damage our reputation in the market as well as our relationships with existing customers, which may result in our inability to attract or retain customers.\nIn addition, because our products are used in security and forensic functions that are often critical to our customers, the licensing and support of our products makes us potentially subject to product liability claims. Any product liability insurance we carry may not be sufficient to cover our losses resulting from any such product liability claims. The successful assertion of one or more large product liability claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIncorrect or improper use of our products, our failure to properly train customers on how to utilize our software products or our failure to properly provide consulting and implementation services could result in negative publicity and legal liability.\nOur products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments. The proper use of our software requires the end user to undergo extensive training and, if our software products are not used correctly or as intended, inaccurate results may be produced. Our customers or our professional services personnel may incorrectly implement or use our products. Our products may also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or non-customer third parties who obtain access and use of our products. Because our customers rely on our product and service offerings to manage a wide range of sensitive investigations and security functions, the incorrect or improper use of our products, our failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our products or our failure to properly provide consulting and implementation services to our customers may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us.\nWe cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain additional financing to develop new products, enhance existing products, offer additional services or fund strategic acquisitions, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to develop new products, enhance existing products, offer additional services or make strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, products or services. Any required additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing security holders will experience dilution of their ownership interest, which could be significant, and the newly-issued securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational and financial flexibility and would also require us to incur additional interest expense. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software products and services through internal research and development or acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could negatively impact our software products and services offerings and sales revenues, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions that we may undertake in the future involve risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies, products or services that we believe complement or expand our existing business, products and services. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention during the acquisition and integration process;\n\u00b7 the possibility that acquisitions will not be completed successfully, or at all, and our potential exposure to termination fees and/or other costs associated therewith;\n\u00b7 the incurrence of substantial legal, accounting, financial advisory and/or other costs;\n\u00b7 costs, delays and difficulties of integrating the acquired company\u2019s operations, technologies and personnel into our existing operations and organization;\n\u00b7 adverse impact on earnings as a result of amortizing the acquired company\u2019s intangible assets or impairment charges related to write-downs of goodwill related to any acquisition;\n\u00b7 issuance of equity securities to pay for acquisitions, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders;\n\u00b7 potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 impact on our financial condition due to the timing of the acquisition or our failure to meet operating or synergy expectations for any acquired business; and\n\u00b7 assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired company.\nAny acquisitions of businesses, technologies, products or services that we may undertake in the future may not generate sufficient revenues or cost-saving synergies necessary to offset the associated costs of the acquisitions or may result in other material adverse effects.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to factors that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant sales and services operations outside the United States, and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from these operations. We also continue to expand and diversify our international operations which will increase our global reach. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we derived approximately 25%, 23%, and 21%, respectively, of our revenues from sales of products and services outside the United States.\nOur international operations are subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries, which risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations;\n\u00b7 the fact that foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u00b7 the general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries;\n\u00b7 the imposition of, or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those pertaining to export duties and quotas, trade and employment restrictions;\n\u00b7 longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 US and foreign import and export laws;\n\u00b7 difficulty in monitoring or effectively preventing business practices which may violate US laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 costs and delays associated with developing software, documentation and training materials in multiple languages; and\n\u00b7 political unrest, war or acts of terrorism occurring in the foreign countries in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future.\nWe may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Furthermore, the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInsiders control a substantial amount of our outstanding stock, and this may delay or prevent a change of control of our company or adversely affect our stock price.\nAs of February 22, 2016, our executive officers, directors and affiliated entities together beneficially own approximately 38% of our common stock outstanding, including approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock held by trusts affiliated with our founder and former Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, Shawn McCreight, and his wife. As a result, these stockholders may have control over matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate actions favored by these stockholders might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest.\nWe have received a notice of nomination from trusts affiliated with Shawn McCreight regarding his intention to nominate five individuals for election to the Company\u2019s board of directors at the Company\u2019s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of his five nominees. If Mr. McCreight does not withdraw the nominations and the proxy contest continues, our business could be adversely affected because:\n\u00b7 responding to the proxy contest, including, but not limited to, issues related to the qualifications of our board of directors and management, can be disruptive, costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our management and employees;\n\u00b7 perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, including, but not limited to, uncertainties related to our board of directors and management, may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties;\n\u00b7 if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders; and\n\u00b7 these types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nIf Mr. McCreight is successful in his proxy contest, part of his agenda may include further changes to our executive management.\nMr. McCreight\u2019s proxy contest may have a negative impact on our ability to retain key executives and employees, which could have a material negative impact on our operations and financial results. During 2015, we hired executives as CEO, CMO, and General Counsel, among others, and appointed two of the five current members onto our board of directors. We cannot provide assurances that further changes to our board of directors or executive management will be effectively managed to transition into control over our businesses. Furthermore, any changes to our management and board of directors will impact our ability to retain remaining executives and employees, which would harm our sales and operations and negatively impact the prospects of our business.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may deter potential acquirers of our business and may thus depress our stock price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company that our stockholders might consider favorable. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our charter documents may make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest or other change of control transaction involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction could cause stockholders to lose a substantial premium over the then current market price of their shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations since our initial public offering in December 2006. Factors that may affect the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations, new solutions, pricing models, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; and\n\u00b7 market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, if the market for software or other technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences continued or greater loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business or financial results. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nAll of our outstanding shares are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Also, shares subject to outstanding options and rights under our Second Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Incentive Plan are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIn addition, our founder, Shawn McCreight, and his wife, continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock. Sales by Mr. McCreight or his wife of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nDisruption in component supplies or a breakdown in the manufacturing supply chain could adversely impact hardware revenues.\nTableau brand hardware products typically incorporate hundreds or more components from a wide range of manufacturing sources. In some cases these components are \u201csole source\u201d, so it is possible for a disruption at a single supplier to constrain or entirely halt production of one of more Tableau brand products, perhaps for an extended period.\nAdditionally, we use offshore contract manufacturing facilities for most of the assembly work related to Tableau brand hardware products. A breakdown in international transportation or political or economic upheaval could negatively impact our ability to manufacture or transport products leading to a loss of hardware product revenue.\nOur balance sheet contained finite-lived intangible assets and goodwill totaling $20.8 million at December 31, 2015 that are subject to impairment review annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value may not be recoverable, resulting in write-downs or write-offs. Such write-downs or write-offs could adversely impact our future earnings and stock price, our ability to obtain financing and our customer relationships.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $14.6 million in indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350) requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value may not be recoverable. Such testing could result in write-downs or write-offs to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets over the implied fair value of the underlying asset. Accordingly, we may, from time to time, incur impairment charges, which are recorded as operating expenses when they are incurred and would reduce our net income and adversely affect our operating results in the period in which they are incurred. One customer represents 59% of our subscription revenue for the year ended 2015. If we were to lose this specific customer, our subscription operations would be adversely affected, and this might result in an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets in this reporting unit.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $6.2 million of other net intangible assets, consisting of core technology, existing and developed technology, customer relationships and tradenames that we amortize over time. Any material impairment to any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations and could affect the trading price of our common stock in the period in which they are incurred.", "PERMNO": 91666, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "GUID"}
