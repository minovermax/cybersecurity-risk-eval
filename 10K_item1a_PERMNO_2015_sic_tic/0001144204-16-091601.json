RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to SmartFinancial, its industry and its market area. Several risk factors regarding investing in our securities are discussed below. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our securities to decline in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings are dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand, business and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates by 25 basis points in December 2015 after having held interest rates at almost zero over recent years. However, the consistently low rate environment has negatively impacted our net interest margin, notwithstanding decreases in nonperforming loans and improvements in deposit mix. Any reduction in net interest income will negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nThe primary tool that management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model prepared by an independent third party provider. As of December 31, 2015, SmartFinancial is considered to be in an asset-sensitive position, meaning income is generally expected to increase with an increase in short-term interest rates and, conversely, to decrease with a decrease in short-term interest rates. Based on the results of this simulation model, which assumed a static environment with no contemplated asset growth or changes in our balance sheet management strategies, if short-term interest rates immediately increased by 200 basis points, we could expect net income to increase by approximately $240 thousand over a 12-month period. This result is primarily due to the floating rate securities and loans which we anticipate would reprice at a quicker rate than our interest bearing liabilities. The actual amount of any increase or decrease may be higher or lower than predicted by our simulation model.\nThe final Basel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published new regulatory capital rules based on the international standards, known as Basel III, that had been developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The new rules raised the risk-based capital requirements and revised the methods for calculating risk-weighted assets, usually resulting in higher risk weights. The new rules became effective on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019.\nThe Basel III-based rules increase capital requirements and include two new capital measurements that will affect us, a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. As an example the Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement of 4% on January 1, 2015 will increase to 8.5% over the next three years. SmartFinancial has approximately $95 million of Tier 1 capital. Under the previous standard we could have grown to about $2.3 billion in assets with our current capital but will be limited to $1.1 billion in assets under the new standards. Since 90 percent of our assets are earning assets and over 90 percent of our revenue is generated from net interest income a future reduction of potential earning assets by over 50 percent could drastically reduce our future income. More details about the new capital requirements can be found in Note 13 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet or through their mobile device. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches (including breaches of security of customer systems and networks) and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses and fair value adjustments with respect to acquired loans is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses with respect to our loan portfolio, in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio, our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions. We also make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification in our loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the economy on real estate and other collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic conditions and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period and the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting in our acquisitions has impacted our allowance for loan and lease losses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the time of acquisition and the related allowance for loan and lease losses was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair values are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance, if any, associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf our analysis or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our general financial condition. As an example an increase in the amount of the reserve to organic loans of 0.05 percent in 2015 would have resulted in a reduction of approximately 7 percent in pre-tax income.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly on economic conditions in our market areas.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our banking offices are currently concentrated in Eastern Tennessee and the Florida Panhandle. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results will depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions, locally or nationally, deteriorate, this may have a significant impact on the amount of loans that we originate, the ability of our borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A return to economic downturn conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, government action or other factors beyond our control would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, some portions of our target market are in areas which a substantial portion of the economy is dependent upon tourism. The tourism industry tends to be more sensitive than the economy as a whole to changes in unemployment, inflation, wage growth, and other factors which affect consumer\u2019s financial condition and sentiment.\nWe may be unable to fully integrate the business of Cornerstone Community Bank and we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger with Legacy SmartFinancial.\nIf our costs to integrate the business of Cornerstone into our existing operations are greater than anticipated or we are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees, loss of customers, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources.\nTo the extent that we are unable to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, or increase loans through organic loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nA substantial part of our historical growth has been a result of acquisitions and we intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of banking franchises coupled with organic loan growth. Previous availability of attractive acquisition targets may not be indicative of future acquisition opportunities, and we may be unable to identify any acquisition targets that meet our investment objectives. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of our strategy may be lost. If we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we must generally satisfy a number of conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including certain bank regulatory approvals, which have become substantially more difficult, time-consuming and unpredictable as a result of the recent financial crisis. Additionally, any future acquisitions may not produce the revenue, earnings or synergies that we anticipated. As our purchased credit impaired loan portfolio, which produces substantially higher yields than our organic and purchased non-credit impaired loan portfolios, is paid down, we expect downward pressure on our income. If we are unable to replace our purchased credit impaired loans and the related accretion with a significantly higher level of new performing loans and other earning assets due to our inability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, a decline in loan demand, competition from other financial institutions in our markets, stagnation or continued deterioration of economic conditions, or other conditions, our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur strategic growth plan contemplates additional acquisitions, which could expose us to additional risks.\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u00b7 incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management's attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u00b7 using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u00b7 incurring time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses, creating an adverse short-term effect on results of operations; and\n\u00b7 losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate and construction and development, may increase our loan losses.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market areas. Consequently, declines in economic conditions in these market areas may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 87 percent of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral, with 17 percent of those loans secured by construction and development collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Real estate values have declined significantly during the recent economic crisis. Although real estate prices in most of our markets have stabilized or are improving, a renewed decline in real estate values would expose us to further deterioration in the value of the collateral for all loans secured by real estate and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCommercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans, particularly when there is a downturn in the business cycle. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located, each of which could increase the likelihood of default on the loan. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nBanking regulators are examining commercial real estate lending activity with heightened scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which in turn could negatively affect our stock price.\nCertain of our deposits and other funding sources may be volatile and impact our liquidity.\nIn addition to the traditional core deposits, such as demand deposit accounts, interest checking, money market savings and certificates of deposits less than $250,000, we utilize or in the past have utilized several noncore funding sources, such as brokered certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Cincinnati advances, federal funds purchased and other sources. We utilize these noncore funding sources to fund the ongoing operations and growth of SmartBank. The availability of these noncore funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions and to investor assessment of our financial strength and, as such, the cost of funds may fluctuate significantly and/or be restricted, thus impacting our net interest income, our immediate liquidity and/or our access to additional liquidity. We have somewhat similar risks to the extent high balance core deposits exceed the amount of deposit insurance coverage available.\nWe impose certain internal limits as to the absolute level of noncore funding we will incur at any point in time. Should we exceed those limitations, we may need to modify our growth plans, liquidate certain assets, participate loans to correspondents or execute other actions to allow for us to return to an acceptable level of noncore funding within a reasonable amount of time.\nWe face additional risks due to our increase in mortgage banking activities that have and could negatively impact our net income and profitability.\nWe have established mortgage banking operations which expose us to risks that are different from our retail and commercial banking operations. During higher and rising interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and the level of refinancing activity tends to decline, which can lead to reduced volumes of business and lower revenues, which could negatively impact our earnings. While we have been experiencing historically low interest rates, the low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. Because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking operations also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (a) the existence of an active secondary market and (b) our ability to profitably sell loans into that market. Our new mortgage banking operations incurred additional expenses over $500 thousand in 2015 and generated income of $250 thousand. Profitability of our mortgage operations will depend upon our ability to increase production and thus income while holding or reducing costs. In addition, mortgages sold to third-party investors are typically subject to certain repurchase provisions related to borrower refinancing, defaults, fraud or other reasons stipulated in the applicable third-party investor agreements. If the fair value of a loan when repurchased is less than the fair value when sold, we may be required to charge such shortfall to earnings.\nAny expansion into new lines of business might not be successful.\nAs part of our ongoing strategic plan, we will continue to consider expansion into new lines of business through the acquisition of third parties, or through organic growth and development. There are substantial risks associated with such efforts, including risks that (a) revenues from such activities might not be sufficient to offset the development, compliance, and other implementation costs, (b) competing products and services and shifting market preferences might affect the profitability of such activities, and (c) our internal controls might be inadequate to manage the risks associated with new activities. Furthermore, it is possible that our unfamiliarity with new lines of business might adversely affect the success of such actions. If any such expansions into new product markets are not successful, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional access to capital, which we may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments, for future growth or to fund losses or additional provision for loan losses in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our stock price negatively affected.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules implemented or to be implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards and this continued investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nInability to retain senior management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services professionals could impair our relationship with our customers, reduce growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services. Moreover, much of our organic loan growth in 2012 through 2015 was the result of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions. Inability to retain these key personnel or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals' skills and customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $6.9 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our financial condition, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Future acquisitions could result in additional goodwill.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is limited.\nThere can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be dividends that we receive from SmartBank. Although the bank\u2019s asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity and capital requirements will be taken into account before we declare or pay any future dividends on our common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from the bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay. For example, Federal Reserve Board regulations implementing the capital rules required under Basel III do not permit dividends unless capital levels exceed certain higher levels applying capital conservation buffers that began to apply on January 1, 2016 and are being phased in over three years.\nAdditionally, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of the Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the \u201cSBLF Preferred Stock\u201d). On August 31, 2015 we assumed all of Legacy SmartFinancial\u2019s obligations with respect to 12,000 shares of Legacy SmartFinancial\u2019s preferred stock issued to the Treasury in connection with the Small Business Lending Fund, and in connection with the merger, we issued 12,000 shares of SBLF Preferred Stock with a $1,000 liquidation preference per share, to the Treasury. As described below, for so long as the SBLF Preferred Stock remains outstanding, our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on shares of common stock is subject to restrictions.\nFurther, in connection with the merger, we entered into a loan agreement for a revolving line of credit of up to $8,000,000. Under the terms of the loan agreement, we may not pay dividends on our common stock if we do not satisfy certain financial covenants and capital ratio requirements.\nEven though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or other stock exchanges. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nWe may issue additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities, including awards to current and future executive officers, directors and employees, which could result in the dilution of shareholders\u2019 investment.\nOur authorized capital includes 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had 5,806,477 shares of Common Stock and 12,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, and had reserved or otherwise set aside for issuance 817,414 shares underlying outstanding options and 2,482,147 shares that are available for future grants of stock options, restricted stock or other equity-based awards pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Subject to NASDAQ rules, our board of directors generally has the authority to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or preferred stock for any corporate purpose. We anticipate that we will issue additional equity in connection with the acquisition of other strategic partners and that in the future we likely will seek additional equity capital as we develop our business and expand our operations, depending on the timing and magnitude of any particular future acquisition. These issuances would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the Common Stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then existing shareholders.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares under our equity compensation plans will result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 ownership of our Common Stock. The exercise price of stock options could also adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional capital. Option holders are most likely to exercise their options when the exercise price is less than the market price for our Common Stock. They may profit from any increase in the stock price without assuming the risks of ownership of the underlying shares of Common Stock by exercising their options and selling the stock immediately.\nThe holder of our SBLF Preferred Stock has rights that are senior to those of SmartFinancial\u2019s common stockholders, and the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock and our loan agreements limit our ability to pay dividends.\nOn August 31, 2015 we assumed all of Legacy SmartFinancial\u2019s obligations with respect to 12,000 shares of Legacy SmartFinancial\u2019s preferred stock issued to the Treasury in connection with the Small Business Lending Fund, and in connection with the merger, we issued 12,000 shares of SBLF Preferred Stock with a $1,000 liquidation preference per share, to the Treasury.\nWe are required to pay cumulative dividends on the SBLF Preferred Stock at an annual rate. The dividend rate was set at 1% per annum beginning in the 2013 due to attaining the target 10% growth rate in qualified small business loans. However, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the dividend rate increased to 9% per annum. Dividends paid on our SBLF Preferred Stock will reduce the net income available to our common stockholders and our earnings per common share.\nFor so long as the SBLF Preferred Stock remains outstanding, our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of common stock is subject to restrictions. We may not repurchase any shares of common or pay dividends on the common stock during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the SBLF Preferred Stock. We may only declare and pay a dividend on the common stock, or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock, if, after payment of such dividend, the dollar amount of our Tier 1 capital would be at least 90% of the Signing Date Tier 1 Capital, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation relating to the SBLF Preferred Stock, excluding any subsequent net charge-offs and any redemption of the SBLF Preferred Stock (the \u201cTier 1 Dividend Threshold\u201d). The Tier 1 Dividend Threshold is subject to reduction, beginning on the second anniversary of issuance and ending on the 10th anniversary, by 10% for each one percent increase in small business lending that qualifies over the baseline level.\nAdditionally, in connection with the merger, we entered into a loan agreement for a revolving line of credit of up to $8,000,000. Under the terms of the loan agreement, we may not pay dividends on our common stock if we do not satisfy certain financial covenants and capital ratio requirements.\nWe are subject to Tennessee\u2019s anti-takeover statutes and certain charter provisions that could decrease our chances of being acquired even if the acquisition is in the best interest of our shareholders.\nAs a Tennessee corporation, we are subject to various legislative acts that impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. These statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if the acquisition would be in our shareholders\u2019 best interests. Our charter also contains provisions which may make it difficult for another entity to acquire us without the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors on our board of directors. Secondly, the amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, certain of our officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose. Agreements with our senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock and option ownership of our board of directors and management, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals that the board of directors and officers oppose.", "PERMNO": 15906, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SMBK"}
