{"cik": "1747009", "company": "Equitrans Midstream Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors (and related summary) should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. The following discussion of risk factors, including the summary, contains forward-looking statements. The summary below is not exhaustive and is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in this section.\nThe risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information, including the full set of risk factors set forth in this section, should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the financial statements and accompanying notes included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\u2022We depend on EQT for a substantial majority of our revenues and future growth and therefore are subject to the business and liquidity risks of EQT, and any further decrease in EQT\u2019s drilling or completion activity could adversely affect us.\n\u2022Decreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation, and the lack of diversification of our assets and geographic locations, could further adversely affect us.\n\u2022The challenging regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets could impact our or the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s ability to obtain or maintain all approvals necessary to complete certain projects on time or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the project. If we do not complete expansion projects, our future growth may be limited and expanding our business by constructing new midstream assets subjects us to risk.\n\u2022Reviews of our goodwill and intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in and could result in significant impairment charges, including with respect to our investment in the MVP Joint Venture.\n\u2022Our subsidiaries\u2019 significant indebtedness, and any future indebtedness, as well as the restrictions under our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, could adversely affect us.\n\u2022Increased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage, and water services, or from alternative fuel sources, could have a negative impact on customer throughput and the demand for our services and could limit our ability to grow.\n\u2022We are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties in the ordinary course of our business.\n\u2022We may not be able to realize the expected investment return under certain of our existing contracts, or renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates, on a long-term basis or at all.\n\u2022Our Hammerhead gathering agreement and pipeline are the subject of a dispute with EQT and we may be affected adversely by this dispute.\n\u2022The outbreak of COVID-19 (or any future pandemic), and related declines in economic output and demand for natural gas, could harm our business and adversely affect us.\n\u2022The demand for the services provided by our water services business could decline, including because of competition.\n\u2022Third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities may become unavailable to transport or process natural gas.\n\u2022Joint ventures that we have entered into (or may in the future enter into) might restrict our operational and corporate flexibility and divert our management\u2019s time and our resources and it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests.\n\u2022Acquisitions that we may make could reduce, rather than increase, our results of operations and liquidity, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms and any financing transactions may increase our financial leverage or cause dilution to our shareholders. A further downgrade of EQM\u2019s credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, including EQT\u2019s, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\n\u2022We face and will continue to face opposition and negative public perception to the development of our expansion projects and the operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups.\n\u2022We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\n\u2022Terrorist or cyber security attacks or threats thereof aimed at our pipelines or facilities or surrounding areas and new laws and regulations governing data privacy could adversely affect us.\n\u2022Events caused by climate change could affect our operations.\n\u2022Significant portions of our pipeline systems have been in service for several decades. We do not own all of the land on which our assets are located, which could disrupt our operations and future development.\n\u2022Our exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.\n\u2022The loss or disengagement of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our plans.\n\u2022Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of the LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest related to our outstanding debt.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\n\u2022Our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation. Changes in or additional regulatory measures, and related litigation, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of adverse events and increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime or as a result of increasingly stringent pipeline safety regulation.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Us\n\u2022We face certain risks related to the tax treatment of EQM and any potential audit adjustment to EQM\u2019s income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017.\n\u2022Our stock price may fluctuate significantly and your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\n\u2022We cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents and Pennsylvania law could impair an attempt to acquire us and our exclusive forum provision in our governing documents could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\n\u2022We may experience difficulties with implementation and operation of our new enterprise resource planning software solution.\n\u2022Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares issued as part of the EQM Merger and the related Restructuring present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Separation\n\u2022We continue to face risks related to the Separation including, among others, those related to U.S. federal income taxes, contingent liabilities allocated to us following the Separation, EQT's obligations under certain Separation-related agreements, potential conflicts arising from certain members of management and directors holding stock in both EQT and us, and potential indemnification liabilities.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe depend on EQT for a substantial majority of our revenues and future growth. Therefore, we are subject to the business and liquidity risks of EQT, and any further decrease in EQT\u2019s drilling or completion activity (or significant production curtailments) could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nHistorically, we have provided EQT a substantial percentage of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage and water services. EQT accounted for approximately 64% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to derive a substantial majority of our revenues from EQT for the foreseeable future, including as a result of the EQT Global GGA.\nGiven the scope of our business relationship with EQT, any event, whether in our areas of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects EQT\u2019s production, financial condition, leverage, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect us. Accordingly, we are subject to the business risks of EQT, including the following:\n\u2022prevailing and projected natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and oil prices and the effect thereon of the significant reduction in the number of operating drilling rigs in the United States in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on already declining gas demand, that reduced or curtailed production of associated natural gas from oil wells in other formations such as the Permian Basin;\n\u2022natural gas price volatility or a sustained period of lower commodity prices, which may have an adverse effect on EQT\u2019s drilling operations, revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, creditworthiness and liquidity;\n\u2022decisions of EQT\u2019s management in respect of curtailing (or subsequently bringing back online) natural gas production, choke management, timing of turning wells in line, and rig and completion activity;\n\u2022a further reduction in or slowing of EQT\u2019s anticipated drilling and production schedule, which would directly and adversely impact demand for our services;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u2022the availability and cost of capital on a satisfactory economic basis to fund EQT\u2019s operations and refinance existing indebtedness as it becomes due, any changes in EQT\u2019s credit ratings and the effects of EQT\u2019s credit support obligations on such availability;\n\u2022the costs of producing natural gas and the availability and costs of drilling rigs and crews and other equipment;\n\u2022infrastructure capacity constraints and interruptions;\n\u2022geologic considerations;\n\u2022risks associated with the operation of EQT\u2019s wells and facilities, including potential environmental liabilities;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability to identify exploration, development and production opportunities based on market conditions;\n\u2022uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production, levels of reserves, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability to develop additional reserves that are economically recoverable, to optimize existing well production and to sustain production, including by use of large-scale, sequential, highly choreographed drilling and hydraulic fracturing, including combo and return-to-pad development;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability or intention to develop additional reserves not covered by our assets or obligations to build;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability to achieve anticipated efficiencies associated with its strategic plan, execute on strategic transactions, if any, and continue to execute on its de-levering plan;\n\u2022adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, including the availability of drilling permits, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing (including limitations in respect of engaging in hydraulic fracturing in specific areas), the potential removal of certain federal income tax deductions with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development or additional state taxes on natural gas extraction, changes in tax laws and negative public perception regarding EQT\u2019s operations;\n\u2022availability of water sources relative to EQT's operating areas;\n\u2022the loss of key personnel and/or the effectiveness of their replacements; and\n\u2022risk associated with cyber security, environmental activists and other threats.\nOn February 17, 2021, EQT announced a projected 2021 capital expenditure forecast of $1.10 billion to $1.20 billion compared to 2020 actual capital expenditures of $1.08 billion. EQT may reduce its capital spending in the future based on commodity prices or other factors. Unless we are successful in attracting significant new customers, our ability to maintain or increase the capacity subscribed and volumes transported or gathered under service arrangements on our gathering, transmission and storage and water systems will depend on receiving consistent or increasing commitments from EQT. While EQT has dedicated a significant amount of its acreage to us, and executed long-term contracts with substantial firm reservation and MVCs on our systems, it may determine in the future that drilling in areas outside of our current areas of operations is strategically more attractive to it, and other than the firm reservations and MVCs, it is under no contractual obligation to maintain its production dedicated to us. Moreover, EQT\u2019s publicly-disclosed strategy continues to focus on capital efficiency, reducing indebtedness and free cash flow generation as opposed to volume growth. On February 17, 2021, EQT publicly disclosed that its development program is expected to result in approximately flat sales volumes for 2021 relative to EQT's pro-forma 2020 levels (reflecting acreage acquired by EQT from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. in 2020 (the Chevron Acquisition)). A reduction in the capacity subscribed or volumes transported or gathered on our systems by EQT (or lack of growth in respect of such volumes) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nEQT may also elect to reduce its drilling activity or curtail production if commodity prices, including natural gas prices in the Appalachian Basin, do not improve to levels EQT determines to be sufficient to justify drilling and production or if such prices decrease below EQT's preferred levels. Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of EQT\u2019s and other producers\u2019 respective reserves and declining prices could have a negative impact on EQT\u2019s and other producers\u2019 development and production activity which could be material depending on the severity of the downturn in prices. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include worldwide political and economic conditions, the length and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and its effect on oil, NGLs and natural gas prices (and the positive impact lower oil prices have had and are expected to have on natural gas prices in the near- and medium-term, primarily as a result of corresponding declines in the production of associated gas in the United States), weather conditions and seasonal trends, the levels of domestic production and consumer demand, new exploratory finds of natural gas, the levels of imported and exported natural gas, oil and LNG, the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity, the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials, the price and availability of (and adoption rate of) alternative fuels, the effect of energy conservation measures, the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, and the anticipated future prices of natural gas, oil, LNG and other commodities. Due to these and other factors, even if reserves are known to exist in areas serviced by our assets, producers have chosen, and may choose in the future, not to develop those reserves. Sustained reductions in development or production activity in our areas of operation could lead to reduced utilization of our services, including our water services which are directly associated with producers\u2019 well completion activities and fresh and produced water needs (which are partially driven by horizontal lateral lengths and the number of completion stages per well).\nAny sustained reductions in development or production activity in our areas of operation, particularly from EQT, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAdditionally, the execution of the EQT Global GGA was based upon assumptions, including regarding EQT\u2019s forecasted drilling and production levels and volumes on our system, that our management believed appropriate at the time of execution. If any of the assumptions fail to be realized, or if actual results differ from these assumptions, we may not achieve anticipated benefits associated with the EQT Global GGA. Failure to achieve anticipated benefits associated with the EQT Global GGA may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Further, if EQT's volumes on our systems do not meet levels we assumed at the time of executing the EQT Global GGA and, during the period of such lower volumes, gathering fee reductions take effect following the in-service date of the MVP as required under the EQT Global GGA, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders may be adversely affected. See \u201cEQT Global GGA\u201d in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDecreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, our business and operating results and reduce our cash available to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nOur business is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves in our areas of operation. A sustained low-price environment for natural gas or regulatory limitations has adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by our pipeline and storage assets and fresh water sources. Production from natural gas wells naturally declines over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. Additionally, producers may determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of our current areas of operations are strategically more attractive to them due to the price environment for natural gas, including locally, or other reasons. A further reduction, or lack of growth, in the natural gas volumes supplied by producers could result in reduced throughput on our systems and adversely impact our ability to sustain and/or grow our operations and pay dividends to our shareholders. Accordingly, maintaining or increasing the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on our systems and cash flows associated therewith is substantially dependent on our customers continually accessing additional reserves of natural gas in or accessible to our current areas of operations.\nThe primary factors affecting our ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of natural gas include the level of successful drilling activity near our systems and our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells, and most development areas in our areas of operation are already dedicated to us or one of our competitors. While EQT has dedicated production from a substantial portion of its leased properties to us, we have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our gathering and transmission systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, we have no control over EQT or other producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, producers\u2019 focus on generating free cash flow and/or de-levering, prevailing and projected energy prices, hedging strategies, demand for hydrocarbons, levels of reserves, the producers\u2019 contractual obligations to us and other midstream companies, geological considerations, environmental or other governmental regulations, the availability of drilling permits, the availability of drilling rigs and crews, and other production and development costs.\nFluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas reserves. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to certain factors such as those described under the heading \u201cWe depend on EQT for a substantial majority of our revenues and future growth. Therefore, we are subject to the business and liquidity risks of EQT, and any further decrease in EQT\u2019s drilling or completion activity (or significant production curtailments) could adversely affect our business and operating results.\u201d Henry Hub spot and local spot natural gas prices, which were under pressure prior to the COVID-19 outbreak due primarily to a warmer than normal 2019 - 2020 winter heating season, a temperate spring 2020 season and an oversupply of natural gas (caused in part by the significant increase in production of associated gas from the Permian Basin and similar basins in recent years), were further pressured by a reduction in global demand for natural gas during 2020 (for which the COVID-19 outbreak was a contributing factor), lack of available natural gas storage and the continued significant supplies of natural gas produced, particularly from the Appalachian Basin. The Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from $1.33 per MMbtu to $3.03 per MMbtu between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, with some prices reflecting the lowest natural gas prices in more than 20 years. Further, market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continue to be lower than Henry Hub natural gas prices and were significantly lower during portions of 2020. Natural gas prices have improved since the spring of 2020 and are expected to further improve during 2021, as reflected by the natural gas forward price strip as of February 19, 2021, primarily due to demand, such as in the winter months, for natural gas potentially exceeding available supply (as a result of, in part, the decrease in associated gas production from the Permian Basin given the dramatic decrease in oil production caused by historical low oil prices during the first half of 2020). However, the length and extent of that price recovery (if any) and its effect on the development plans of our customers, which impact both our ability to execute new commercial agreements with our customers as well as the volumetric-based fee revenues we earn under existing contracts, will be impacted by global demand for natural gas, the length and severity of the 2020-2021 winter heating season, rates of natural gas production (including amounts of associated gas from the Permian Basin, which certain analysts are projecting will increase in 2021 and later years), and the length and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no assurance that the elevated natural gas prices indicated by the forward natural gas price strip as of February 19, 2021 will be realized or be realized for any particular length of time or that producers will increase production volume as a result of any particular price level.\nLow natural gas prices, particularly in the Appalachian Basin, have had a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and on utilization of our systems and, if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity and further decreases in such utilization. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Moreover, EQT and other producers may not develop the acreage they have dedicated to us. If reductions in drilling activity result in our inability to maintain levels of contracted\ncapacity and throughput, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems. Accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves connected to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our systems are less than we anticipate, or the timeline for the development of reserves is longer than we anticipate, and we are unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIf new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins in our areas of operation, or if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets, the overall volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on our systems would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings could impact our or the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects.\nCertain of our internal growth projects require regulatory approval from federal, state and/or local authorities prior to and/or in the course of construction, including any extensions from, expansions of or additions to our and the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s transmission and storage systems. The approval process for certain projects has become increasingly slower and more difficult, due in part to state and local concerns related to exploration and production, transmission and gathering activities in production areas, including the Marcellus and Utica Shales, and the increasingly negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, including major pipeline projects like the MVP and MVP Southgate. Further, regulatory approvals and authorizations, even when obtained, have increasingly been subject to judicial challenge by pipeline opponents seeking that issued approvals and authorizations be stayed and vacated.\nAccordingly, authorizations needed for our internal growth projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, may not be granted or, if granted, such authorizations may include burdensome or expensive conditions or may later be stayed or revoked or vacated.\nIn addition, significant delays in the regulatory approval process for growth projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, have significantly increased costs and negatively impacted the targeted in-service dates for the projects, and further delays, such as because of a stay or loss of a critical authorization, may cause similar adverse effects, including to the MVP project\u2019s targeted full in-service date in late 2021 and the MVP Southgate project\u2019s targeted in-service date in 2022. Significant delays and cost increases in turn could adversely affect our ability, and, in the case of the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, the ability for the MVP Joint Venture and its owners, including us, to achieve the expected investment returns and/or cause other-than-temporary declines in value associated with the projects. The MVP and MVP Southgate projects in particular are subject to several agency actions and judicial challenges (and will likely become subject to further actions and challenges) that must be resolved before the MVP and MVP Southgate projects can be completed, as described in more detail in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cOutlook\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThere is no guarantee that the MVP Joint Venture will ultimately (or timely) receive authorizations or that such authorizations will be maintained in effect following challenge. Even if the MVP Joint Venture does succeed in resolving challenges or restoring or obtaining the necessary permits and other authorizations, this may not occur within the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s targeted time frame for placing the MVP project or the MVP Southgate project in service or enable the MVP Joint Venture to meet the targeted project costs.\nAs the MVP project nears completion and in light of the abandonment by third parties of certain other similar pipeline projects, we have experienced and may further experience increased opposition from activists in the form of lawsuits, intervention in regulatory proceedings and otherwise, which has been and/or may be focused on the few remaining portions of the project. Such focused opposition may make it increasingly difficult to complete the project and place it in service within the targeted time frame or at all and may also affect the ability to effect extensions and/or expansions of the project. We also expect that as pre-construction activity in respect of the MVP Southgate project increases (or if construction were to commence), the MVP Southgate project may be subject to similar heightened opposition. These and other challenges to our internal growth projects, particularly the MVP project, could adversely affect our business (including by increasing the possibility of investor activism), financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe gathering fees payable by EQT to us set forth in the EQT Global GGA are subject to potential reductions for certain contract years set forth in the EQT Global GGA, conditioned upon the in-service date of the MVP, which provide for estimated aggregate fee relief of $270 million in the first year after the in-service date of the MVP, $230 million in the second year after the in-service date of the MVP and $35 million in the third year after the in-service date of the MVP. In addition, if the MVP in-service date has not occurred by January 1, 2022, EQT has an option, exercisable for a period of twelve months, to forgo approximately $145 million of the gathering fee relief in the first year after the MVP in-service date and approximately $90 million of the gathering fee relief in the second year after the MVP in-service date in exchange for a cash payment from us to EQT in the amount of approximately $196 million. In addition, among the other benefits to us pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, EQT is subject to an initial annual MVC of 3.0 Bcf per day that gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the in-service date of the MVP. Any further delay in the MVP in-service date may prevent us from achieving a portion of the anticipated benefits associated with the execution of the EQT Global GGA. See \u201cEQT Global GGA\u201d in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nReviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in significant impairment charges, and reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets could result in future significant impairment charges, including with respect to our investment in the MVP Joint Venture.\nGAAP requires us to perform an assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount.\nWe may perform either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of potential impairment. Our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment analysis is not necessary. Under this elective process, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative analysis is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis. If we choose not to perform a qualitative assessment, or if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred, then we will perform a quantitative assessment. In the case of a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated and compare it to the carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value over its fair value.\nAssessing goodwill for potential impairment requires significant judgments and estimates by management. Fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is recorded is estimated using a combination of an income and market approach which, in the case of the income approach, applies significant inputs not observable in the public market (Level 3), including estimates and assumptions related to the use of an appropriate discount rate, future throughput volumes, operating costs, capital spending and changes in working capital, and, in the case of the market approach, applies metrics and multiples derived from comparable companies and reference transactions. All of our goodwill as of December 31, 2020 relates to a business that was acquired and valued by EQT\u2019s management in the November 2017 acquisition by EQT of Rice Energy Inc. The reporting unit to which goodwill is recorded as of December 31, 2020 is the EQM Opco reporting unit (defined and discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reporting units and impairment previously recognized.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management\u2019s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable (meaning, in the case of equity method investments, that such investments have suffered other-than-temporary declines in value). With respect to property, plant and equipment and finite lived assets, asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. These cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost, commencement of operations, resolution of relevant legal and regulatory matters, and other factors. If the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable. The determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to evaluations of recoverability and the recognition of additional impairments. The evaluation and measurement of impairments for equity method investments involves similar uncertainties, judgments and estimates as those applicable to other long-lived assets. If the equity method investment carrying value exceeds the fair value and it is determined that the decline in value is other-than-temporary, we will recognize an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The fair value of equity method investments is generally estimated using an income approach\nunder which significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows, the appropriate discount rate and probability-weighted scenarios.\nEstimates and assumptions used in reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets (including equity method investments) are inherently subjective, subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial and other risks, and require complex judgments. If actual results differ from the estimates or assumptions are not realized (or if estimates or assumptions, such as of the probability of success of the projects to which an equity method investment relates, change), we may be required to recognize an impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $486.7 million of goodwill (all associated with the EQM Opco reporting unit) and $11.3 billion of other long-lived assets, which will be monitored for future impairment.\nIf the operations or projected operating results of our businesses decline, we could incur additional goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangible asset impairment charges. Further, if we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable or the value associated with our equity method investment in the MVP Joint Venture has suffered an other-than-temporary decline, we would incur additional impairment charges. Future impairment charges could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recorded. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment. However, our closing stock price decreased by approximately 17% between January 15, 2021 and January 20, 2021. If our stock price does not recover before the end of the first quarter of 2021, such change in our market value during the first quarter may trigger a quantitative assessment for impairment for the first quarter of 2021, which may result in our realizing impairments, the magnitude of which we are unable to estimate as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and \u201cOutlook-Potential Future Impairments\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional information.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 significant indebtedness, and any future indebtedness, as well as the restrictions under our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, could adversely affect our operating flexibility, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe respective debt agreements of EQM and Eureka Midstream, LLC (Eureka), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eureka Midstream, contain various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit EQM\u2019s and Eureka, as applicable, ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022make distributions on or redeem or repurchase units;\n\u2022incur or permit liens on assets;\n\u2022enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022enter into burdensome agreements, subject to certain specified exceptions;\n\u2022enter into certain mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022dispose of all or substantially all of their respective assets.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Amended EQM Credit Facility and the Eureka Credit Facility. The Amended EQM Credit Facility contains certain negative covenants, that, among other things, establish for EQM a maximum consolidated leverage ratio that varies over the course of the term ranging from not more than 5.75 to 1.00 to not more than 5.00 to 1.00, tested as of the end of each fiscal quarter (which in limited circumstances is increased for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). EQM's consolidated leverage ratio is derived from a number of components, including the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended EQM Credit Facility) from certain approved projects, including the MVP project, that is available to be included in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. If the targeted in-service date for the MVP project is further delayed, such delay could result in a decrease in the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA for future quarters, which, absent other actions which may be available to the Company to reduce its then-leverage, may further limit the Company's ability to borrow under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. Under the Eureka Credit Facility, Eureka is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 (which in limited circumstances is increased for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). Additionally, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, Eureka may not permit the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Eureka Credit Facility) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to\nConsolidated Interest Charges (as defined in the Eureka Credit Facility) to be less than 2.50 to 1.00. EQM\u2019s and Eureka\u2019s ability to meet these covenants can be affected by events beyond their respective control and we cannot assure our shareholders that EQM or Eureka will continue to meet these covenants. In addition, the Amended EQM Credit Facility and the Eureka Credit Facility each contain certain events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control.\nIn addition to the above-described facilities, EQM has issued senior unsecured notes which remain outstanding.\nThe provisions of the debt agreements may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of the debt agreements could result in an event of default, which could enable creditors to, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement, declare any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of the debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and in turn our shareholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investments. The Amended EQM Credit Facility also has a cross default provision that applies to any other indebtedness EQM may have with an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25 million.\nWe and our subsidiaries may in the future incur additional debt. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 levels of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022our funds available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to our shareholders may be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt;\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service our subsidiaries\u2019 current, or our or our subsidiaries\u2019 future, respective debts, will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our subsidiaries\u2019 current, or our or our subsidiaries\u2019 future, indebtedness, as applicable, or our operating results affect our ability to comply with covenants in our debt agreements, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 current substantial indebtedness and the additional debt we and/or our subsidiaries will incur in the future for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, acquisitions or operating activities may adversely affect our liquidity and therefore our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries\u2019 significant indebtedness may be viewed negatively by credit rating agencies, which could result in increased costs for us to access the capital markets. Any future additional downgrade of the debt issued by EQM could significantly increase our capital costs or adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the future.\nIf we do not complete expansion projects, our future growth may be limited, and we face and will continue to face opposition to the development of our expansion projects and the operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur ability to grow organically depends primarily upon our ability to complete expansion projects, including, without limitation, the MVP and MVP Southgate projects (and related expansions and extensions thereof), that result in an increase in the cash we generate. We may be unable to complete successful, accretive expansion projects for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022an inability to identify attractive expansion projects;\n\u2022an inability to obtain and/or maintain necessary rights-of-way, real-estate rights or permits or other government approvals, including approvals by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022an inability to successfully integrate the infrastructure we build with our existing systems;\n\u2022an inability to obtain and/or maintain sources of fresh water;\n\u2022an inability to raise financing for expansion projects on economically acceptable terms;\n\u2022incorrect assumptions about volumes, revenues, costs and in-service timing, as well as potential growth; or\n\u2022an inability to secure or maintain adequate customer commitments to use the newly expanded facilities.\nAdditionally, we face and expect to continue to face opposition to the development of expansion projects (such as the MVP project) and operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, local and national groups opposed to the natural gas industry and/or fossil fuels, activists and other advocates. Such opposition has taken and will likely continue to take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block, vandalize or sabotage our development or operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets directly or indirectly, lawsuits, legislation or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business.\nAny event that delays or interrupts the completion of expansion projects, and/or revenues generated, or expected to be generated, by our operations or that causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nExpanding our business by constructing new midstream assets subjects us to risks.\nOrganic and greenfield growth projects are a significant component of our growth strategy. The development and construction of pipelines and storage facilities involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. The development and construction of pipeline infrastructure and storage facilities exposes us to risks such as the failure to meet customer contractual requirements, delays caused by landowners, advocacy groups or activists opposed to the natural gas industry in the form of lawsuits, intervention in regulatory proceedings, environmental hazards, vandalism, adverse weather conditions, the performance of third-party contractors, the lack of available skilled labor, equipment and materials and the inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all (and maintain such rights-of-way, approvals and permits once obtained). These types of projects may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, our revenues may not increase for some time after completion of a particular project. For instance, we are required to pay construction costs generally as they are incurred but construction typically occurs over an extended period of time, and we will not receive revenues or material increases in revenues until the project is placed into service. Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production and/or demand in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIncreased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage, and water services, or from alternative fuel sources, could have a negative impact on the demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. Our systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities in the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and may be better positioned to compete as the midstream industry moves towards greater consolidation; further, some of such competitors may now, or in the future, have access to greater supplies of natural gas or water than we do. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering systems, transmission and storage systems and water systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may develop or acquire their own gathering, transmission or storage, or water services instead of using ours.\nThe policies of the FERC promoting competition in natural gas markets are having the effect of increasing the natural gas transmission and storage options for our traditional customer base. As a result, we have experienced, and in the future could experience, \u201cturnback\u201d of firm capacity as existing agreements expire. If we are unable to remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted rates compared to previous contracts, we may have to bear the costs associated with the turned back capacity. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of natural gas transported or stored on our systems or, in cases where we do not have long-term firm contracts, could force us to lower our transmission or storage rates. Increased competition could also adversely affect demand for our water services.\nFurther, natural gas as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including coal, liquid fuels and, increasingly, renewable and alternative energy. Demand for renewable and alternative energy is increasing generally with changes in consumer preferences and as renewable and alternative energy becomes more cost competitive with traditional fuels and more widely available. Continued increases in the demand for renewable and alternative energy at the expense of natural\ngas (or increases in the demand for other sources of energy, particularly if prices for natural gas significantly increase relative to other forms of energy as fuel) could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.\nAll of these competitive pressures could make it more difficult for us to retain our existing customers and/or attract new customers and/or additional volumes from existing customers as we seek to maintain and expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. In addition, competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by our systems, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties in the ordinary course of our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from the nonpayment and/or nonperformance of our customers, suppliers, joint venture partners and other counterparties as further described in \u201cCredit Risk\u201d under \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\u201d We extend credit to our customers as a normal part of our business. While we have established credit policies, including assessing the creditworthiness of our customers as permitted by our FERC-approved natural gas tariffs, and may require appropriate terms or credit support from them based on the results of such assessments, including in the form of prepayments, letters of credit, or guaranties, we may not have adequately assessed the creditworthiness of our existing or future customers. Pursuant to the EQT Global GGA and the Credit Letter Agreement, amongst other things, (a) we agreed to relieve certain credit posting requirements for EQT, in an amount up to approximately $250 million under its commercial agreements with us, subject to EQT maintaining a minimum credit rating from two of three rating agencies of (i) Ba3 with Moody\u2019s, (ii) BB- with S&P and (iii) BB- with Fitch. As of February 22, 2021, EQT\u2019s public debt had sub-investment grade credit ratings of BB with a stable outlook at S&P, Ba2 with a stable outlook at Moody\u2019s, and BB with a positive outlook at Fitch. We cannot predict the extent to which the businesses of our counterparties would be impacted if commodity prices decline, commodity prices are depressed for a sustained period of time, or other conditions in the energy industry were to further deteriorate, nor can we estimate the impact such conditions would have on the abilities of our customers to perform under their gathering, transmission and storage and water services agreements with us. The recent low commodity price environment negatively impacted natural gas producers causing some producers significant economic stress including, in certain cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. To the extent one or more of our counterparties, including EQT, is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings (such as the bankruptcy proceedings commenced by Gulfport on November 13, 2020), contracts with these counterparties may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Bankruptcy Code). On November 24, 2020, Gulfport moved to reject its gas gathering agreements with certain of our subsidiaries and made certain related court filings attempting to reject the agreements, which motions we have opposed. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Gulfport accounted for approximately 9% of the Company's operating revenues. Nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our counterparties occurring as a result of changes in the conditions in energy industry and/or any unfavorable renegotiation or rejection of contracts under the Bankruptcy Code could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates, on a long-term basis or at all.\nOne of our exposures to market risk occurs at the time our existing contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which we have executed firm contracts, our firm gathering contracts and firm transmission and storage contracts had weighted average remaining terms of approximately 15 years and 14 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the level of existing and new competition to provide services to our markets;\n\u2022the macroeconomic factors affecting natural gas economics for our current and potential customers;\n\u2022the balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in our markets;\n\u2022the extent to which the customers in our markets are willing to contract on a long-term basis or require capacity on our systems; and\n\u2022the effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers.\nAny failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts or to extend or replace our more significant contracts, or extending or replacing contracts at unfavorable or lower rates or with lower or no associated firm reservation fee revenues, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur Hammerhead gathering agreement and pipeline are the subject of a dispute with EQT and we may be affected adversely by the pendency of such dispute and/or if the dispute is resolved in a manner adverse to us.\nOn September 23, 2020, EQT and certain of its affiliates instituted arbitration proceedings against us relating to the Hammerhead gathering agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to construct the Hammerhead pipeline and related facilities and gather gas for EQT. See \u201cHammerhead Pipeline\u201d under \u201cOutlook\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional information. The dispute, during its pendency, could adversely affect our business and operating results, including by causing us to incur expenses in arbitration or additional proceedings in excess of those currently expected and by diverting management time and resources. Also, while the dispute is ongoing, we believe the market price of our common stock may continue to be adversely affected by the perception that the dispute is negatively affecting our overall commercial relationship with EQT. In addition, if the dispute is resolved in a manner adverse to us, such resolution could result in EQT\u2019s acquisition of Hammerhead assets in exchange for a reimbursement payment or otherwise affect or negate our ability to recognize revenue and generate operating cash flows in the future from such assets.\nThe lack of diversification of our assets and geographic locations could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe rely exclusively on revenues generated from our gathering, transmission and storage and water systems, substantially all of which are located in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Due to our lack of diversification in assets and geographic location, an adverse development in these businesses or our areas of operations, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events, pandemics, epidemics, weather, regulatory action, local prices, producer liquidity, decreases in demand for natural gas, specifically dry gas, from the Appalachian Basin or increases in supply of natural gas (such as if oil production, and consequently associated gas production, were to substantially recover) could have a more significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our ability to pay dividends than if we maintained more diverse assets and locations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 (or any future pandemic), and related declines in economic output and demand for natural gas, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe natural gas forward price strip as of February 19, 2021 indicated higher prices relative to the lower prices during portions of 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak and related effects thereof on the natural gas market. However, a slower, shorter or limited recovery in natural gas prices, such as because of continued economic malaise due to continuing effects of COVID-19 (despite increasing availability of a vaccine), may result in further curtailments by our customers (beyond those effected in 2020) or otherwise continue to adversely impact the demand for our services.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the further impact of the COVID-19 outbreak (or any other outbreak) on the domestic economy, the natural gas industry, or us; however, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected in numerous ways, including, without limitation, that:\n\u2022our customers and suppliers may be adversely affected due to the economic downturn and recession resulting from the outbreak and may be adversely affected if the outbreak causes further or long-duration declines in the price of, demand for and production of natural gas or prevents such customers (particularly EQT) from conducting, or curtails their ability to conduct, field operations and continue natural gas production, which could reduce demand for our services, negatively affect throughput on our systems or heighten our exposure to risk of loss resulting from the nonpayment and/or nonperformance of our customers;\n\u2022our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient if a significant number of our employees or contractors are unavailable due to illness or if our field operations, including in respect of projects in development, were to be suspended or temporarily shut down or restricted due to outbreak control measures;\n\u2022legal and regulatory processes relating to our projects in development, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, may be disrupted or slowed, such as if relevant governmental authorities suffer reduced workforce availability due to the virus; and\n\u2022resultant disruption to, and instability in, financial and credit markets may adversely affect our access to capital, leverage and liquidity levels and credit ratings, as well as our counterparties\u2019 access to capital, business continuity,\nfinancial stability, leverage and liquidity levels and credit ratings (which could heighten counterparty credit risk to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of our business).\nAlthough we believe that we are following best practices under COVID-19 guidance and intend to continue to refine our practices as additional guidance is released, there is no guarantee that efforts by us or any other entity or authority to mitigate potential adverse impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, whether on a local, state or national level, will be effective.\nWe also may incur additional costs to further attempt to mitigate potential impacts caused by COVID-19 related disruptions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the COVID-19 outbreak (including federal, state and local governmental responses, broad economic impacts and market disruptions) has heightened and may further heighten many of the other risks set forth herein. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on us will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, appearance of new strains of the virus, duration of the outbreak, and related economic effects and aftereffects (including on the natural gas industry), and actions taken to contain COVID-19 or its impact, including, vaccine acceptance, distribution and effectiveness, among others.\nThe demand for the services provided by our water services business could decline as a result of several factors.\nOur water services business includes fresh water distribution for use in our customers\u2019 natural gas, NGL and oil exploration and production activities. Water is an essential component of natural gas, NGL and oil production during the drilling and the hydraulic fracturing process. As a result, the demand for our fresh water distribution and produced water handling services is tied to the level of drilling and completion activity of our customers, including EQT (which is currently and anticipated to continue to be our primary customer for such services). More specifically, the demand for our water distribution and produced water handling services has been and could be further adversely affected by any further reduction in or slowing of EQT\u2019s or other customers\u2019 well completions, any reduction in produced water attributable to completion activity, or the extent to which EQT or other customers complete wells with shorter lateral lengths, which would lessen the volume of fresh water required for completion activity, and may also be affected by other companies that provide water services. In addition, increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas, NGL and oil production by our water service customers, which could reduce the number of wells for which we provide water services.\nThe availability of our water supply may be limited due to reasons including, but not limited to, prolonged drought, difficulty obtaining permits or regulatory delays associated with infrastructure development. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water, changes in wastewater disposal requirements, or changes in the regulation of water withdrawal and use may incentivize water recycling efforts by oil and natural gas producers, which could decrease the demand for our fresh water distribution services. Customers also have, in some cases, elected and may elect to develop their own water services businesses to service their assets. For example, on February 17, 2021, EQT announced that it expects to invest $45 million to $55 million during 2021 to build a 45-mile mixed-use water system in West Virginia to service the development of portions of its West Virginia acreage.\nWe may not be able to increase our customer throughput and resulting revenue due to competition and other factors, which could limit our ability to grow.\nOur ability to increase our customer-subscribed capacity and throughput and resulting revenue is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including competition from third-party producers\u2019 existing contractual obligations to competitors, the location of our assets relative to those of competitors for potential producer customers, and the extent to which we have available capacity when shippers require it. To the extent that we lack available capacity on our systems for volumes, we may not be able to compete effectively with third-party systems for additional natural gas production in our areas of operation.\nOur efforts to attract new customers or larger commitments from existing customers may be adversely affected by our desire to provide services pursuant to long-term firm contracts and contracts with MVCs. Our potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements under which we would be required to assume direct commodity exposure.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport or process natural gas, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide receipt and delivery options to and from our transmission and storage system. For example, our transmission and storage system interconnects with the following interstate pipelines: Texas Eastern, Dominion Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and ET Rover Pipeline, LLC, as well as multiple distribution companies. Similarly, our gathering systems have multiple delivery interconnects to multiple interstate pipelines. In the event that our\naccess to such systems is impaired, the amount of natural gas that our gathering systems can gather and transport would be adversely affected, which could reduce revenues from our gathering activities as well as transmission and storage activities. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If these or any other pipeline connections or facilities were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to operate efficiently and continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nCertain of the services we provide on our transmission and storage system are subject to long-term, fixed-price \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts that are subject to limited or no adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, our costs could exceed our revenues received under such contracts, we could be unable to achieve the expected investment return under such contracts, and/or our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nIt is possible that costs to perform services under \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts will exceed the negotiated rates we have agreed to provide to our customers. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by our systems and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to a \u201cnegotiated rate,\u201d and that contract must be filed with and accepted by the FERC. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 97% of the contracted firm transmission capacity on our system was subscribed under such \u201cnegotiated rate\u2019\u2019 contracts. Unless the parties to these \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts agree otherwise, the contracts generally may not be adjusted to account for increased costs that could be caused by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.\nWe have entered into joint ventures, and may in the future enter into additional or modify existing joint ventures, that might restrict our operational and corporate flexibility and divert our management\u2019s time and our resources. In addition, it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests and these joint ventures are subject to many of the same operational risks to which we are subject.\nWe have entered into joint ventures to construct the MVP and MVP Southgate projects and a joint venture relating to Eureka Midstream and may in the future enter into additional joint venture arrangements with third parties. Joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility. Joint venture arrangements and dynamics can also divert management and operating resources in a manner that is disproportionate to our ownership percentage in such ventures. Because we do not control all of the decisions of the MVP Joint Venture or the joint venture relating to Eureka Midstream, it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests. For example, we cannot unilaterally cause the distribution of cash by the MVP Joint Venture or Eureka Midstream. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing that we fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which we may not control, and our joint venture partners may not act in a manner that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests or satisfy their financial obligations to the joint venture. In addition, the operations of the MVP Joint Venture, Eureka Midstream and any joint ventures we may enter into in the future are subject to many of the same operational risks to which we are subject.\nAcquisitions that we may make could reduce, rather than increase, our results of operations and liquidity, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022mistaken assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including synergies and potential growth;\n\u2022an inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities;\n\u2022an inability to integrate successfully the assets or businesses we acquire;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from other business concerns in a manner that is disproportionate to our ownership percentage in such acquired assets or entities; and\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas, with new joint venture partners or new business lines.\nIf risks such as the above are realized, or if an acquisition fails to be accretive to our cash generated from operations on a per share basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIf we or our subsidiaries are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our ability to execute our business strategy and pay dividends to our shareholders may be diminished. Additionally, financing transactions may increase our financial leverage or could cause dilution to our shareholders.\nIn order to expand and maintain our asset base and complete announced expansion projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, we will need to continue to make significant capital expenditures and capital contributions. If we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures and capital contributions, we will be unable to expand or maintain our business operations, which impacts our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIn order to fund our capital expenditures and capital contributions, we may use cash from our operations, incur borrowings under our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities or through debt capital market transactions, enter into our own credit arrangements or sell additional shares of our equity or a portion of our assets. Using cash from operations will reduce the cash we have available to pay dividends to our shareholders. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for debt offerings, or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity offerings, may be limited by, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings, as applicable, the covenants in our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, the rights and preferences governing the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, general economic conditions, including related to the COVID-19 outbreak, market conditions in our industry, changes in law (including tax laws), and other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Additionally, market forces are affecting (and are expected to continue to affect) the availability of capital to energy industry participants. For example, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change continue to direct their attention towards, among other things, sources of funding for fossil fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investments in energy-related activities. Further, such institutions are increasingly allocating funds to those industries and companies perceived as having better growth opportunities and/or stronger ESG metrics and practices. Such market forces may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future or achieve increases in our stock price.\nAs of February 22, 2021, EQM and EQT had sub-investment grade credit ratings at each of Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch. See \u201cA further downgrade of EQM\u2019s credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, including EQT\u2019s, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\u201d Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile, especially for companies involved in the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, the solvency of counterparties specifically and general market trends favoring funding non-fossil fuel industries and companies (or fossil fuel industry companies with stronger ESG metrics and practices), the cost of obtaining money from the bank markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity or at all or on terms similar to the borrower\u2019s current debt, and reduced, or in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, particularly those in the fossil fuel industry. The repricing of credit risk, concern regarding funding fossil fuel companies given climate change, and the relatively weak economic conditions in the oil and gas industry, compounded by the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, have made, and will likely continue to make, it difficult for some entities to obtain funding on favorable terms or at all. As a result, even if we or our subsidiaries are successful in obtaining funds for capital expenditures and capital contributions through debt or equity financings, as applicable, the terms thereof could limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage thereby limiting our ability to further borrow, and issuing additional equity may result in significant common shareholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the then-current dividend rates, which could materially decrease our ability to pay dividends at the then-current dividend rates. If funding is not available to us or our subsidiaries when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to execute our business plans, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which (or actions taken to attempt to address any such funding issue) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to numerous hazards and operational risks.\nOur business operations are subject to the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas and performance of water services. These operating risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022damage to pipelines, facilities, equipment, environmental controls and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, abnormal amounts of rainfall, floods, fires, droughts, landslides and other natural disasters and acts of sabotage, vandalism and terrorism;\n\u2022inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, and farm and utility equipment;\n\u2022uncontrolled releases of natural gas and other hydrocarbons;\n\u2022uncontrolled releases of fresh or produced water;\n\u2022leaks, migrations or losses of natural gas as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities and, with respect to storage assets, as a result of undefined boundaries, geologic anomalies, natural pressure migration and wellbore migration;\n\u2022ruptures, fires and explosions;\n\u2022pipeline freeze offs due to cold weather; and\n\u2022other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution to the environment and suspension of operations.\nThese risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, regulatory investigations and penalties and substantial losses to us. The location of certain segments of our systems in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the damages resulting from these risks. Despite any precautions taken, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people, property or the environment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. Such circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and repair activities, could result in service interruptions on segments of our systems. Potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our systems could include, but are not limited to, limitations on our ability to satisfy customer contractual requirements, obligations to provide reservation charge credits to customers in times of constrained capacity and solicitation of our existing customers by third parties for potential new projects that would compete directly with our existing services. Such circumstances could adversely impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nNegative public perception regarding us, MVP, MVP Southgate, other of our expansion projects, the midstream industry, and/or the natural gas industry in general have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our operations and business, and negative public perception may increase the likelihood of governmental initiatives aimed at the natural gas industry.\nNegative public perception regarding us, the MVP, MVP Southgate, other of our expansion projects, other industry participants and their projects and actions, the midstream industry and/or the natural gas industry in general resulting from, among other things, climate change, oil spills, the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines and other facilities, erosion and sedimentation issues, unpopular expansion projects, and general concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing and pipeline projects (as well as specific concerns raised by such groups in respect of particular pipeline projects), has led to, and may in the future lead to, increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new local, state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, enforcement interpretations and/or adverse judicial rulings or regulatory actions. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d These actions have caused, and may continue to cause, operational delays or restrictions, increased construction and operating costs, penalties under construction contracts, additional regulatory burdens and increased litigation. As discussed under \u201cThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings could impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects,\u201d there are several pending challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project that must be resolved before the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project, as applicable, can be completed. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we and the MVP Joint Venture need to complete the expansion projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, and conduct our and its respective operations to be denied, removed, withheld, delayed, stayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our and its respective abilities to profitably conduct business or make it more difficult to obtain the real property interests needed in order to operate\nrelevant assets or complete planned growth projects, which could result in revenue loss or a reduction in our and the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s customer bases.\nAdditionally, there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels aimed at the natural gas industry, including those to restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. Adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities or other limitations with respect to the natural gas industry could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business, including environmental accidents that might occur as well as many cyber events. In addition, we do not maintain business interruption insurance of the types and in amounts necessary to cover all possible risks of loss, like project delays caused by pandemics, governmental action or inaction. The occurrence of any operating risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe currently maintain excess liability insurance that covers our and our affiliates\u2019 legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use, to third parties. This excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability but excludes: release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal; release of substances arising from the combustion of fuels that result in acidic deposition; and testing, monitoring, clean-up, containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody or control of us and our affiliates. We also maintain coverage for us and our affiliates for physical damage to assets and resulting business interruption, including damage caused by terrorist acts.\nMost of our insurance is subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could adversely affect our operations, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the types and in the amounts we desire at reasonable rates, and we may elect to self-insure a portion of our asset portfolio. The insurance coverage we have obtained or may obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. In addition, for pre-Distribution losses, we share insurance coverage with EQT, and we will remain responsible for payment of any deductible or self-insured amounts under those insurance policies. To the extent we experience a pre-Distribution loss that would be covered under EQT\u2019s insurance policies, our ability to collect under those policies may be reduced to the extent EQT erodes the limits under those policies.\nTerrorist or cyber security attacks or threats thereof aimed at our pipelines or facilities or surrounding areas and new laws and regulations governing data privacy could adversely affect us.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications, to operate our assets, and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, our systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in delivery of natural gas and NGLs, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, communication interruptions, environmental damage, personal injury, property damage and other operational disruptions, as well as damage to our reputation, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources beyond those currently budgeted to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. In addition, new U.S. laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal information may potentially elevate our compliance costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a cyber incident, could result in significant penalties and liability to us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nSignificant portions of our pipeline systems have been in service for several decades. There could be unknown events or conditions, or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime, associated with our pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nSignificant portions of our transmission and storage system and FERC-regulated gathering system have been in service for several decades. The age and condition of these systems could result in adverse events, or increased maintenance or repair expenditures, and downtime associated with increased maintenance and repair activities, which could materially reduce our revenue. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or loss of revenue due to the age or condition of our\nsystems could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 66%, 58% and 54%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from firm reservation fees. Although our goal is to execute long-term firm reservation fee and MVC contracts with new or existing customers in the future, our efforts to obtain such contractual terms may not be successful. As of December 31, 2020, most of our water service agreements are volumetric in nature and therefore are more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and downturns in hydraulic fracturing by our customers in the future. In addition, we may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in the future that do not provide services primarily based on capacity reservation charges or other fixed fee arrangements and therefore have a greater exposure to fluctuations in commodity price risk than our current operations. Exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices, including regional basis differentials with regard to natural gas prices, as a result of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAdditionally, the EQT Global GGA provides for potential cash bonus payments payable by EQT to us during the period beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter in which the MVP in-service date occurs through the earlier of the twelfth calendar quarter from that point or the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024 (the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision). The fair value of the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision is largely determined by estimates of the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas forward price curve, and payments are conditioned upon the quarterly average of certain Henry Hub natural gas prices exceeding certain price thresholds. Based on the Henry Hub natural gas forward strip prices as of February 19, 2021 and the terms of the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, delays in the in-service date for the MVP project, including beyond the most recent targeted full in-service of late 2021, may decrease the estimated fair value of the derivative asset attributable to the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision. Such changes in estimated fair value, if any, would be recognized in other income on our statements of consolidated comprehensive income and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations and future development.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines, storage systems and facilities have been constructed, and we are therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms, and/or increased costs or delays, to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights-of-way or easements, if such rights-of-way or easements lapse or terminate or if our facilities are not properly located within the boundaries of such rights-of-way or easements. Although many of these rights are perpetual in nature, we occasionally obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. If we were to be unsuccessful in negotiating or renegotiating rights-of-way or easements, we might have to institute condemnation proceedings on our FERC-regulated assets or relocate our facilities for non-regulated assets. It is possible that the U.S. Congress may amend Section 7 of the NGA to require that condemnation authority not be exercised and construction may not begin until a FERC certificate order has been reviewed on rehearing. A loss of rights-of-way or easements or a relocation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Additionally, even when we own an interest in the land on which our pipelines, storage systems and facilities have been constructed, agreements with correlative rights owners may require that we relocate pipelines and facilities or shut in storage systems and facilities to facilitate the development of the correlative rights owners\u2019 estate, or pay the correlative rights owners the lost value of their estate if they are not willing to accommodate development.\nA further downgrade of EQM\u2019s credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, including EQT\u2019s, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\nAs of February 22, 2021, EQM\u2019s credit ratings were Ba3 with a negative outlook, BB- with a stable outlook and BB with a negative outlook from Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch, respectively. EQM\u2019s credit ratings have fluctuated (and may further fluctuate) depending on, among other things, EQM\u2019s leverage, uncertainty around the full in-service date of the MVP project and EQT's credit profile.\nEQM\u2019s credit ratings are subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant, including in connection with the MVP project or the creditworthiness of EQM\u2019s customers, including EQT. Credit rating agencies perform an independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. This analysis includes a number of criteria such as business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies\ncontinue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies.\nIf any credit rating agency further downgrades or withdraws EQM\u2019s ratings, including for reasons relating to the MVP project (such as future delays in the targeted full in-service date of the MVP project or increases in such project\u2019s costs), EQM\u2019s leverage or credit ratings of our customers (including EQT), our access to the capital markets could become more challenging, borrowing costs will likely increase, EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances (the amount of which may be substantial), including the Cash Option Letter of Credit, in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease.\nIn order to be considered investment grade, EQM must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody\u2019s, BBB- or higher by S&P and BBB- or higher by Fitch. EQM\u2019s non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted in greater borrowing costs, including under the Amended EQM Credit Facility, and increased collateral requirements, including under the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s limited liability company agreement, than if EQM\u2019s credit ratings were investment grade.\nIn addition to causing, among other impacts, higher borrowing costs, any further downgrade could also require additional or more restrictive covenants on future indebtedness that impose operating and financial restrictions on our subsidiaries, certain of our subsidiaries to guarantee such debt and certain other debt, and certain of our subsidiaries to provide collateral to secure such debt.\nAny increase in our financing costs or additional or more restrictive covenants resulting from a credit rating downgrade could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations. If a credit rating downgrade and/or a resultant collateral requirement were to occur at a time when we are experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lack liquidity, our business, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nThe loss or disengagement of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans.\nOur operations are dependent upon key management, technical and professional personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. The unexpected loss of the services and skills of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. In addition, the success of our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain experienced personnel. There is increased competition for experienced technical and other professionals, primarily in the corporate services functions, which could increase the costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such personnel. Additionally, a lack of employee engagement could lead to increased employee burnout, loss of productivity, increased propensity for errors, increased employee turnover, increased absenteeism, increased safety incidents and decreased customer satisfaction, which may in turn negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot identify, attract, develop, retain and engage key management, technical and professional personnel, along with other qualified employees, to support the various functions of our business, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of the LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under our subsidiaries\u2019 respective credit facilities may bear interest at rates based on U.S. dollar LIBOR (USD LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), the administrator of LIBOR, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other LIBOR currency-tenor pairs. U.S. regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, published a concurrent statement supporting the IBA\u2019s plans but also urging banks to phase out LIBOR as soon as practicable. On December 4, 2020, the IBA published its consultation on the potential cessation of LIBOR, consistent with its earlier announcement. In light of these recent announcements, the future of USD LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which USD LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to USD LIBOR\u2019s phase-out could cause USD LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. The Amended EQM Credit Facility provides for mechanisms to amend the facility to reflect the establishment of an alternative rate of interest upon the occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of LIBOR, while the Eureka Credit Facility requires USD LIBOR based loans to be converted to base rate borrowings.\nIn June 2017, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Alternative Reference Rates Committee announced the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its recommended alternative to USD LIBOR. However, the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of USD LIBOR, and there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any time.\nWe have not yet pursued any technical amendments or other contractual alternatives to address this matter. We are evaluating the potential impact of the cessation of USD LIBOR; however, we are not able to predict whether USD LIBOR will cease to be available or cease to be used, when such cessation may occur, whether SOFR or any other rate will become a widely accepted replacement for LIBOR, or the terms on which we may be able to renegotiate our credit facilities and the eventual impact of such developments on our interest expense. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial markets could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\nOur natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes in or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends.\nOur interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the NGA and the NGPA and the regulations, rules and policies promulgated under those and other statutes. Certain portions of our gathering operations are also currently regulated by the FERC in connection with our interstate transmission operations. Our FERC-regulated operations are pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates (other than market-based rate authority), cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to our customers. The FERC\u2019s authority extends to a variety of matters relevant to our operations. For additional information, see \u201cRegulatory Environment-FERC Regulation\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment-FERC Regulation of Gathering Rates and Terms of Service\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nPursuant to the NGA, existing interstate transmission and storage rates, terms and conditions of service, and contracts may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Additionally, rate increases, changes to terms and conditions of service and contracts proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be protested and such actions can be delayed and may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. We currently hold authority from the FERC to charge and collect (i) \u201crecourse rates,\u201d which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff, (ii) \u201cdiscount rates,\u201d which are rates below the \u201crecourse rates\u201d and above a minimum level, (iii) \u201cnegotiated rates,\u201d which involve rates above or below the \u201crecourse rates,\u201d provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement, and (iv) market-based rates for some of our storage services from which we derive a small portion of our revenues. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 97% of our contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under our tariff, rather than recourse, discount or market-based rate contracts. There can be no guarantee that we will be allowed to continue to operate under such rate structures for the remainder of those assets\u2019 operating lives. Customers, the FERC or other interested stakeholders, such as state regulatory agencies, may challenge our rates offered to customers or the terms and conditions of service included in our tariffs. We do not have an agreement in place that would prohibit customers, including EQT or its affiliates, from challenging our tariffs. Any successful challenge against rates charged for our transmission and storage services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAny changes to the FERC\u2019s policies regarding the natural gas industry may have an impact on us, including the FERC\u2019s approach to pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as interstate pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transmission capacity and transmission and storage facilities. The change in party control at FERC and in Congress in 2021 may lead to changes in the NGA or FERC regulations or policies that may impact our operations and affect our ability to construct new facilities.\nA significant construction project generally requires review by multiple governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any agency\u2019s delay in the issuance of, or refusal to issue, authorizations or permits for one or more of these projects may mean that we will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that we did not anticipate. Such delays, refusals or resulting modifications to projects could materially and negatively impact the revenues and costs expected from these projects or cause us to abandon planned projects.\nFailure to comply with applicable provisions of the NGA, the NGPA, federal pipeline safety laws and certain other laws, as well as with the regulations, rules, orders, restrictions and conditions associated with these laws, could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties. For example, the FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately $1 million (adjusted periodically for inflation) per violation, per day for violations of the NGA, the NGPA or the rules, regulations, restrictions, conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes.\nIn addition, future federal, state or local legislation or regulations under which we will operate our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage businesses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, including in respect of climate change, that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities, and events caused by climate change could affect our operations.\nOur operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan, design, install, operate and abandon gathering, transmission and water systems and pipelines, as well as storage systems. Legal requirements relating to the environment, health and safety govern discharges of substances into the air, water and ground; the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of contaminated sites; groundwater quality and availability; plant and wildlife protection; locations available for pipeline construction; environmental impact studies and assessments in connection with permitting; restoration of properties after construction or operations are completed; pipeline safety (including replacement requirements); and work practices related to employee health and safety. Compliance with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business, including delays in obtaining (or challenges maintaining) permits or other government approvals, may increase our cost of doing business, result in delays or restrictions in the performance of operations due to the need to pursue alternative construction methods or obtain additional or more detailed permits or other governmental approvals or even cause us to abandon an existing project or not to pursue a new project. For example, the FWS continues to receive hundreds of petitions to consider listing of additional species as endangered or threatened and is being regularly sued or threatened with lawsuits to address these petitions. Some of these legal actions have resulted in, and may in the future result in, listing of species located in areas in which we operate. Such designations of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species, can result in increased costs, construction delays, restrictions in our operations or abandonment of projects. Listing of aquatic species could potentially affect water supplies or delay related infrastructure development. As discussed under \u201cThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings could impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects,\u201d there are several pending challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project that must be resolved before the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project, as applicable, can be completed, including those litigation and regulatory-related delays discussed in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d In addition, lack of compliance with laws, regulations or other legal requirements could subject us to claims for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Our failure to comply with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business, even if as a result of factors beyond our control, could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages.\nThe EPA regulates GHG emissions from new and modified facilities that are potential major sources of criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs and has adopted regulations that require, among other things, preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources and the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis. Laws, regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing, and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming. For additional information on laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to us, see \u201cRegulatory Environment-Environmental Matters\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. In addition to periodic changes to air, water and waste laws, as well as anticipated EPA initiatives to impose climate change-based air regulations on industry, which we expect to increase under the Biden Administration, the U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating and/or implemented climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of GHGs, including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide (a byproduct of burning natural gas). Several states are also pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of GHGs from new and existing sources. Many states and regions have adopted GHG initiatives and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities. For example, ten northeastern states and Virginia participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement (RGGI) aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. RGGI imposes a cap on emissions of carbon dioxide on all fossil-fuel fired electric generating facilities that are 25 MW or larger and allows for trades of carbon dioxide emissions in the participating states. Pennsylvania has taken steps to join RGGI. It is likely that these regional efforts will continue. If implemented, GHG restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to, or taxes on the release, capture and use of, GHGs that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Further, initiatives such as RGGI may adversely affect demand for natural gas and accordingly our producer customers, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThere is a risk that we may incur costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices, our handling of wastes and potential emissions and discharges related to our operations. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which our gathering system or our transmission and storage system pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to require remediation of contamination or enforce compliance with environmental requirements as well as to seek damages for personal injury or property damage. In addition, changes in environmental law that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. We may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance.\nFurthermore, climate change is expected to result in storms, floods and other climatic events of increasing severity and/or frequency which may, depending on the location and severity of such events, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of increasingly stringent pipeline safety regulation, including pipeline integrity management program testing and related repairs.\nThe DOT, acting through PHMSA, has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could harm high population areas, unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area. The regulations require operators, including us, to:\n\u2022perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high population area;\n\u2022maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and\n\u2022implement preventive and mitigating actions.\nChanges to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a material adverse effect on us. For more information on the laws, regulations and risks applicable to us, see \u201cRegulatory Environment-Pipeline Safety and Maintenance\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nThe adoption of legislation relating to hydraulic fracturing and the enactment of new or increased severance taxes and impact fees on natural gas production could cause our current and potential customers to reduce the number of wells they drill in the Marcellus and Utica Shales or curtail production of existing wells. If reductions are significant for those or other reasons, the reductions would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur assets are primarily located in the Marcellus Shale fairway in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia and the Utica Shale fairway in southeastern Ohio, and a substantial majority of the production that we receive from customers is produced from wells completed using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells, particularly in unconventional resource plays like the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and similar agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process, including the EPA, which finalized effluent limit guidelines allowing zero discharge of waste water from shale gas extraction operations to a publicly owned treatment plant in 2016 in addition to existing limits on direct discharges. Additionally, in response to increased public concern regarding the alleged potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels.\nThe U.S. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, while a growing number of states, including those in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, have imposed fees on the drilling of new unconventional oil and gas wells. Some states have elected, and other states could elect, to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether. Also, certain\nlocal governments have adopted, and others may adopt, ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Further, several federal governmental agencies are conducting reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA. For example, in December 2016, the EPA issued its final report on a study it had conducted over several years regarding the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. The final report, contrary to several previously published draft reports issued by the EPA, found instances in which impacts to drinking water may occur. However, the report also noted significant data gaps that prevented the EPA from determining the extent or severity of these impacts. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nState and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity (induced seismicity). In a few instances, operators of injection disposal wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. While Pennsylvania is not one of the states where such regulation has been enacted, regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on our customers.\nThe adoption of new laws, regulations or ordinances at the federal, state or local levels imposing more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult for our customers to complete natural gas wells, increase customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our gathering, transmission and storage, or water services.\nFurthermore, the tax laws, rules and regulations that affect our customers are subject to change. For example, Pennsylvania\u2019s governor has previously proposed legislation to impose a state severance tax on the extraction of natural resources, including natural gas produced from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, either in replacement of or in addition to the existing state impact fee. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislature has not thus far advanced any of the governor\u2019s severance tax proposals; however, severance tax legislation may continue to be proposed in future legislative sessions. Any such tax increase or change could adversely impact the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our customers and cause them to reduce their drilling in the areas in which we operate, which could negatively impact demand on our gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Us\nFor taxable years prior to January 1, 2021, the tax treatment of EQM depended on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat EQM as a corporation or if EQM becomes subject to additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state or foreign tax purposes for any open taxable year prior to January 1, 2021, it would reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nPrior to the EQM Merger, EQM was a publicly traded partnership and the anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our shares depended largely on EQM being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which requires that 90% or more of EQM\u2019s gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income, as defined in Section 7704 of the Code. As a result of the EQM Merger, the requirements under Section 7704 of the Code are no longer applicable to EQM for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020.\nDespite the fact that EQM is a limited partnership under Delaware law and has not elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it is possible, under certain circumstances, that the IRS could determine on audit for taxable years prior to January 1, 2021 for EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. For example, EQM would be treated as a corporation if the IRS determined that less than 90% of EQM\u2019s gross income for any taxable year consisted of qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code.\nIf EQM was treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes for any taxable year prior to January 1, 2021, EQM would pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate applicable to the relevant tax year and would likely pay state income taxes at varying rates. Distributions to us after the Separation Date would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to us. Treatment of EQM as a corporation could result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow in the year of the payment to the IRS, potentially causing, among other things, a substantial reduction in the value of our shares.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM\u2019s income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from EQM, in which case we may be required, and potentially former unitholders would be required, to reimburse EQM for such payment or, if EQM is required to bear such payment, our cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders might be substantially reduced.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM\u2019s income tax return for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable interest and penalties) directly from EQM. EQM will have a limited ability to shift any such tax liability to its general partner and unitholders, including us, in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that EQM will be able to do so under all circumstances, or that EQM will be able to effect corresponding shifts in state income or similar tax liability resulting from the IRS adjustment in states in which EQM does business in the year under audit or in the adjustment year. As a result of the EQM Merger, we own all of the EQM common units. If EQM makes payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments with respect to tax periods beginning in 2017 and before 2021, we may be and potentially former unitholders may be required to reimburse it for such payment or, if EQM is required to bear such payments, our cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders might be substantially reduced.\nIn the event the IRS makes an audit adjustment to EQM\u2019s income tax returns and EQM does not or cannot shift the liability to its unitholders in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, EQM will generally have the ability to request that the IRS reduce the determined underpayment by reducing the suspended passive loss carryovers of EQM\u2019s unitholders (without any compensation from EQM to such unitholders), to the extent such underpayment is attributable to a net decrease in passive activity losses allocable to certain partners. Such reduction, if approved by the IRS, will be binding on any affected unitholders.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may further decline or fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022any further delays to the MVP full in-service date or further MVP cost increases (or the market\u2019s perception that such delays or increases will occur);\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022additional declines, or flat or slow growth, in the production of natural gas by our customers, including EQT, in our areas of operation;\n\u2022declining operating revenues derived from our core business;\n\u2022any further delays in the MVP Southgate in-service date or MVP Southgate cost increases;\n\u2022inability to complete growth projects;\n\u2022the gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate;\n\u2022the rate of adoption of renewable and alternative energy as an alternative to natural gas;\n\u2022the recovery to pre-2020 levels or increased growth in the production of associated natural gas in other formations such as the Permian Basin and the supply of such gas to our end-use markets;\n\u2022market conditions in the oil-and-gas industry and domestic and worldwide economy as a whole;\n\u2022changes in commodity prices and the effect of commodity prices on our business, including future decisions of customers in respect of curtailing (or subsequently bringing back online) natural gas production, choke management, timing of turning wells in line, rig and completion activity and related impacts on our business;\n\u2022changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the energy, gas and water industries;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding us, our competitors, our customers (and our relationships with our customers) and our industry, including the ongoing trend of investors allocating funds to those industries and companies perceived as having better growth opportunities and/or stronger ESG metrics and practices;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or other strategic transactions or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022effects of any consolidation of or effected by upstream gas producers, whether in or outside of the Appalachian Basin;\n\u2022failure to identify or integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions, business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or other strategic transactions;\n\u2022changes in our customers\u2019, including EQT\u2019s, respective credit ratings and access to capital;\n\u2022defaults, if any, of our customers, including EQT;\n\u2022additional investments from third parties;\n\u2022our consolidated leverage level, the ability of our subsidiaries (some of which are not wholly owned) to service debt under, and comply with the covenants contained in, their respective credit agreements, and our ability to, and the pace at which we may, de-lever;\n\u2022the impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among other things, effects on demand for natural gas and our services, levels of production of associated gas from basins such as the Permian Basin, commodity prices and access to capital;\n\u2022the effect and outcome of litigation and other proceedings, including regulatory proceedings;\n\u2022dividend amounts, timing and rates;\n\u2022effects of conversion, if at all, of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares; and\n\u2022issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, have caused and could also continue to cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nCertain of the above described factors have contributed to a general decline in our stock price from a per share closing price of $20.89 on November 13, 2018 (the initial date shares of our common stock began regular way trading on the NYSE) to $7.33 on February 22, 2021. A reduced stock price affects, among other things, our cost of capital and could affect our ability to execute on future strategic transactions, as well as increase opportunities for investor activism or unsolicited third-party activity affecting us.\nOur stock price may be adversely affected by transactions in our common stock by significant shareholders, including EQT.\nWe expect that EQT will ultimately dispose of its ownership interest in us, representing approximately 5.8% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020, when it deems appropriate consistent with the business reasons for the retention of such common stock, but in no event later than five years after the Distribution. EQT management has indicated that EQT\u2019s position in our common stock may be utilized to support EQT\u2019s goal to further de-lever. There can be no assurance regarding the method by which EQT will dispose of its interest in us, as we expect EQT to seek to maximize overall value to its shareholders, or the actual timing of any such disposal.\nAdditionally, any disposition by EQT, or any other significant shareholder, of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nEQT may alternatively decide for any reason not to consummate a disposition of our common stock and instead retain a significant ownership interest in us for a period of time (not exceeding five years). Any delay by EQT in completing the disposition of its ownership interest in us could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock, which could affect investor confidence in us.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock, and we may further reduce the amount of the cash dividend that we pay on our common stock or may not pay any cash dividends at all to our shareholders. Our ability to declare and pay cash dividends to our shareholders, if any, in the future will depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe are not required to declare and pay dividends to our common shareholders, and our Board may decide to reduce the amount of the cash dividend that we pay on our common stock or may decide not to declare any dividends in the future. Although we have in the past paid regular cash dividends, any payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, our leverage, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. We are also not entitled to pay any dividends on any junior securities, including any shares of our common stock, prior to paying the quarterly dividends payable to the holders of Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, including any previously accrued and unpaid dividends.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future we may issue common stock or other equity to raise cash for our projects, operations, acquisitions or other purposes and may also acquire interests in other companies or assets by using one or more of cash, debt and/or our equity.\nAny of these events may dilute your ownership interests in us, reduce our earnings per common share and have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. The issuance of these new shares and the sale of additional shares from time to time could have the effect of depressing the market value for our common stock. The increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding or the issuance of other equity of us, and any resulting dilution, may cause holders to sell shares of our common stock or may create the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market value of, our common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in us may also be diluted because of equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees or otherwise as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions or capital market transactions. Our Management Development and Compensation Committee and our Board have authority to grant share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefit plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per common share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock that have such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nAs more fully described under \u201cAs part of the EQM Merger and the related Restructuring, we issued Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares in exchange for a portion of the then-outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Units, which Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares by virtue of their terms and preferences present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock\u201d, at the effective time of the EQM Merger, we created and issued the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares in exchange for a portion of the then-outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Units. Upon the occurrence of certain events or the passage of time, the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares may be converted by the holder or us, as applicable, initially on a one-for-one basis in the case of certain conversions by holders, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments and an adjustment for any dividends that have accrued but not been paid when due and partial period dividends. If we or a holder of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares convert Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares into common stock, the conversion will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Pennsylvania law, could impair an attempt to acquire us.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of us deemed undesirable by our Board. These include provisions:\n\u2022requiring the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock for the approval of certain transactions;\n\u2022requiring the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our articles of incorporation and bylaws, under certain circumstances;\n\u2022authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022specifying that our shareholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and prohibiting our shareholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022requiring advance notice of proposals by our shareholders for business to be conducted at shareholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board; and\n\u2022controlling the procedures for conduct of our Board and shareholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our directors.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of us. As a Pennsylvania corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Pennsylvania law, including certain provisions of Chapter 25 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (PBCL), which, among other things, requires enhanced shareholder approval for certain transactions between us and a shareholder who is a party to the transaction or is treated differently from other shareholders and also prevents persons who become the beneficial owner of shares representing 20% or more of our voting power from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of our Board, and in some cases preventing consummation of the transaction for at least five years.\nAny provision of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Second Amended and Restated Bylaws or Pennsylvania law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of us could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOn May 1, 2020, our Board announced, upon recommendation from the Corporate Governance Committee, that it will propose at the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, and recommend that the shareholders approve, amendments to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws to eliminate the supermajority voting requirements described above. These amendments are subject to the approval of the record holders of our common stock and Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares at the time of our annual meeting, and as such, we cannot guarantee that our shareholders will vote to eliminate the supermajority voting requirements.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless our Board otherwise determines, the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of ours to us or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of us arising pursuant to any provision of the PBCL or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Second Amended and Restated Bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision set forth in our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws does not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nWhen applicable, this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Pennsylvania were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties with implementation and operation of our new enterprise resource planning software solution.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. We are committing significant resources to implementation activities and the system software. Our ERP system is critical to our financial reporting and ability to establish effective controls and execute critical business processes. The transition to our new ERP system may be disruptive to our business if the ERP system, which is being done in phases, does not work as planned or if we experience issues relating to the implementation. Such disruptions could impact our ability to provide important information to our management, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business. In addition, we may experience periodic or prolonged disruption of our financial functions arising out of the implementation and conversion, general use of the system, other periodic upgrades or updates, or other external factors that are outside of our control. Additionally, if the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or ability to assess it adequately could be delayed. This ERP system and our other information technology systems may be vulnerable to data breaches, cyber-attacks or fraud.\nAs part of the EQM Merger and the related Restructuring, we issued Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares in exchange for a portion of the then-outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Units, which Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares by virtue of their terms and preferences present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock.\nAt the effective time of the EQM Merger, we created and issued the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares in exchange for a portion of the then-outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Units. The creation and issuance of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock, including a preference in favor of holders of Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends on our common stock, the risk of dilution occurring as a result of the conversion of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares into our common stock and the ability of the holders of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares to vote with the holders of our common stock on most matters, as well as the risk that the holders of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to our organizational documents that would be adverse (other than in a de minimis manner) to any of the rights, preferences or privileges of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares.\nPursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, in connection with the closing of the Restructuring, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain holders of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares pursuant to which, among other things, we gave the Investors certain rights to require us to file and maintain one or more registration statements with respect to the resale of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares and the shares of our common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, and which, upon request by certain Investors party to the Registration Rights Agreement, will require us to initiate underwritten offerings for the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares and the shares of our common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares and use our best efforts to cause the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares to be listed on the securities exchange on which the shares of our common stock are then listed. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nIf the Separation and Distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not continue to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify EQT for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIt was a condition to the Distribution that (i) a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and certain other U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and Distribution shall not have been revoked or modified in any material respect and (ii) EQT received an opinion of counsel with respect to certain tax matters relating to the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The IRS private letter ruling is based upon and relies on, and the opinion of counsel is based upon and relies on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of EQT and us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of EQT and us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any representations or covenants contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to any IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel are breached, such IRS private letter ruling and/or opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which such IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, continues to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represented the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in any opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of an IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for the intended tax treatment or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to material U.S. federal income tax liability.\nEven if the Distribution otherwise qualifies as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it would result in a material U.S. federal income tax liability to EQT (but not to its shareholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in EQT\u2019s stock or in the stock of us as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution, and we may be required to indemnify EQT for any such liability under the tax matters agreement entered into by EQT and us in connection with the Distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel described above, a sufficient change in ownership of EQT or our common stock may occur which could result in a material tax liability to EQT.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that EQT entered into with us, we may be required to indemnify EQT against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by us or (iii) any of our representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. For a more detailed discussion, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that the EQM Merger or Share Purchases resulted in the Distribution and/or certain related transactions being treated as taxable transactions to EQT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to indemnify EQT for such taxes and related amounts.\nCertain contingent liabilities allocated to us following the Separation may mature, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of EQT may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the Distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group for that taxable period. Consequently, if EQT is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a pre-Separation period, we could be required to pay the amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement. For a discussion of the tax matters agreement, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nWe or EQT may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and EQT entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement as well as various other agreements, including a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and a shareholder and registration rights agreement with respect to EQT\u2019s continuing ownership of our common stock. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and include indemnification related to liabilities and obligations. If EQT is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For a description of these agreements with EQT, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCertain members of our management and directors may hold stock in both EQT and us, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nAlthough none of our management or directors serve at both EQT and the Company, certain of our management and directors may own both shares of common stock in EQT (EQT common stock) and our common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our management and directors and EQT management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and EQT. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and EQT. For more information, see \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\u201d found in our Proxy Statement.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to EQT pursuant to agreements relating to the Separation and Distribution could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement with EQT provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between us and EQT with respect to and resulting from the Separation. For a description of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Among other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Separation, as well as those obligations of EQT assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. If we are required to indemnify EQT under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. See also the discussion of potential indemnification obligations under \u201cIf the Separation and Distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not continue to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify EQT for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\u201d", "PERMNO": 18150, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "ETRN"}
