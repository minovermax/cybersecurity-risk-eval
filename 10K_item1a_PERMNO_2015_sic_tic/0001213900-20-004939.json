{"cik": "1698113", "company": "Legacy Acquisition Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our securities. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating results to date. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with Blue Valor, or any other potential target company. If we fail to complete our business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFollowing the approval of the Extension Amendment, we have only until the Outside Extended Date to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination by the Outside Extended Date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $750,000 released to us annually to fund working capital requirements) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We have determined that such mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments to our financial statements contained in this Form 10-K have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the Outside Extended Date.\nLegacy will not obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party as to the fairness of the business combination to its stockholders.\nLegacy is not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the price it is paying to consummate the business combination is fair to its public stockholders from a financial point of view. Legacy\u2019s public stockholders must therefore rely solely on the judgment of Legacy\u2019s board of directors for such assessment.\nLegacy\u2019s initial stockholders have agreed to vote in favor of the business combination, regardless of how Legacy\u2019s public stockholders vote.\nLegacy\u2019s initial stockholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, as well as any public shares purchased during or after Legacy\u2019s IPO, in favor of an initial business combination. Legacy\u2019s initial stockholders own approximately 20.4% of Legacy\u2019s outstanding shares of stock. As a result, in addition to the Founder Shares, Legacy would need a total of 10,902,590, or approximately 37.2%, of the outstanding 29,305,180 public shares to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have the business combination approved. Accordingly, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received for the business combination than would be the case if Legacy\u2019s initial stockholders agreed to vote their Founder Shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by Legacy\u2019s public stockholders.\nFurthermore, assuming only the minimum number of stockholders required to be present at the stockholders\u2019 meeting held to approve the business combination are present at such meeting, Legacy would need only 10,902,591 of the outstanding 29,305,180 public shares, or approximately 37.2% of the outstanding public shares, to be voted in favor of the business combination in order to have it approved.\nSince Legacy\u2019s Sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in Legacy if a business combination is not completed in time, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for Legacy\u2019s initial business combination.\nIn October 2016, Legacy\u2019s Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. On September 18, 2017, Legacy effectuated a 1.5-for-1 stock split in the form of a dividend, resulting in 8,625,000 Founder Shares outstanding and held by the Sponsor (up to 1,125,000 of which are subject to forfeiture). The Founder Shares will be worthless if Legacy does not complete an initial business combination. In addition, the Sponsor purchased 17,500,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable for one-half of one share of Legacy\u2019s stock at $5.75 per half share, for a purchase price of $8.75 million that will also be worthless if Legacy does not complete a business combination.\nThe Founder Shares are identical to the shares of Legacy\u2019s stock except that (i) the Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, (ii) Legacy\u2019s initial stockholders, officers, directors and director nominees entered into a letter agreement with Legacy, pursuant to which they agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and public shares in connection with the completion of Legacy\u2019s initial business combination, (b) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their Founder Shares if Legacy fails to complete an initial business combination before the deadline for the completion of an initial business combination (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if Legacy fails to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame); (iii) the Founder Shares will automatically convert into shares of Legacy\u2019s stock at the time of its initial business combination on a one for one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights, as described herein; and (iv) the Founder Shares are subject to registration rights.\nThe personal and financial interests of Legacy\u2019s executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in approving, promoting and completing the business combination, especially as the deadline imposed pursuant to the Extension Amendment nears.\nThe exercise of Legacy\u2019s initial stockholders\u2019 discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the business combination may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the business combination or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in the best interests of Legacy\u2019s stockholders.\nIn the period leading up to the closing of the business combination, events may occur that, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, would require Legacy to agree to amend the Share Exchange Agreement, to consent to certain actions taken by the Seller, or to waive rights that Legacy is entitled to under the Share Exchange Agreement. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of the Blue Impact business, a request by the Seller to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on the Blue Impact business and would entitle Legacy to terminate the Share Exchange Agreement. In any such circumstances, it would be at Legacy\u2019s discretion, acting through its board of directors, to grant its consent or waive those rights. The existence of the financial and personal interests of Legacy\u2019s officers and directors described in the preceding risk factors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors between what they may believe is best for Legacy and what they may believe is best for themselves in determining whether or not to take the requested action.\nLegacy does not have a specified maximum redemption threshold and, subject to limited exceptions, its public stockholders may redeem all of their shares. However, pursuant to its charter, Legacy will not redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and, under the Share Exchange Agreement, if the funds in Legacy\u2019s trust account are less than $120 million upon the consummation of the business combination, Legacy may not be able to complete the business combination. These thresholds may make it possible for Legacy to complete the business combination even though a substantial majority of its stockholders redeem their shares or do not agree with the business combination.\nLegacy\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold and, subject to limited exceptions, its public stockholders may redeem all of their shares. However, (i) pursuant to its charter, in no event will Legacy redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of the business combination (such that it becomes subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) and (ii) the Share Exchange Agreement includes as a condition to Closing that the funds contained in the trust account must equal or exceed $120,000,000 plus all accrued interest available to Legacy as of Closing such that if redemptions cause this condition to not be satisfied, Legacy may not be able to complete the business combination. As a result, Legacy may be able to complete the business combination even though a substantial majority of its public stockholders redeem their shares or do not agree with the business combination or have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to Legacy\u2019s sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration that Legacy would be required to pay for all shares of stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to Legacy, it will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and Legacy would instead have to search for an alternate business combination or liquidate.\nIf the benefits of the business combination do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of Blue Impact\u2019s shares may decline.\nIf the benefits of the business combination do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of Blue Impact\u2019s shares may be materially adversely affected. The market values of Blue Impact\u2019s shares at the time of the Closing may vary significantly from the prices of Legacy\u2019s securities on the date the Share Exchange Agreement was executed, the date of this proxy statement or the date on which Legacy\u2019s stockholders vote on the business combination. In addition, following the business combination, fluctuations in the price of Blue Impact\u2019s securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the business combination, there has not been a public market for Blue Impact\u2019s stock and trading in Legacy\u2019s shares has not been active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to Blue Impact in the business combination may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the business combination. If an active market for Blue Impact\u2019s securities develops and continues, the trading price of Blue Impact\u2019s securities following the business combination could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which will be beyond Blue Impact\u2019s control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nFactors affecting the trading price of Blue Impact\u2019s securities following the business combination may include:\n\u25cf the Blue Impact\u2019s ability to attract and retain senior management or key operating personnel;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in the Blue Impact\u2019s results of operations;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations;\n\u25cf the announcement of acquisitions by Blue Impact or its competitors;\n\u25cf changes in general economic and political conditions;\n\u25cf volatility in the financial markets;\n\u25cf results of Blue Impact\u2019s operations and the operations of others in its industry;\n\u25cf threatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf actions taken by Blue Impact\u2019s stockholders, including the sale or disposition of their shares; and\n\u25cf differences between Blue Impact\u2019s actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts and changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections.\nAdditionally, broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of Blue Impact\u2019s securities irrespective of its operating performance. The stock market in general, and NYSE in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of Blue Impact\u2019s securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for advertising & marketing services stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to Blue Impact could depress Blue Impact\u2019s stock price regardless of its business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of Blue Impact\u2019s securities also could adversely affect its ability to issue additional securities and its ability to obtain additional financing in the future, further adversely affecting Blue Impact\u2019s financial condition, or prospects.\nFollowing the business combination, if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Blue Impact business, its business or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding Blue Impact\u2019s stock adversely, the price and trading volume of Blue Impact\u2019s stock could decline.\nThe trading market for Blue Impact\u2019s stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Blue Impact business, its business, market or competitors. Securities and industry analysts may never publish research on the Blue Impact business. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Blue Impact business, its stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Blue Impact business change their recommendation regarding its stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about its competitors, the price of its stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Blue Impact business were to cease coverage of the Blue Impact business or fail to regularly publish reports on it, it could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause Blue Impact\u2019s stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBlue Impact will not have operations of its own and will conduct all of its operations through its subsidiaries.\nUpon consummation of the business combination, Blue Impact will derive all of its operating income from its subsidiaries. Other than any cash that Blue Impact may retain following the business combination, all of its assets will be held by its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Blue Impact will rely on the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries for its cash and financing requirements, including the provision of funds necessary to repay any debt it may incur, which will be paid to Blue Impact by its subsidiaries, if and only to the extent available. The ability of Blue Impact\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to it will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends and other distributions to Blue Impact), the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other agreements of Blue Impact\u2019s subsidiaries and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness that Blue Impact or its subsidiaries incur. Any limitation on the ability of Blue Impact\u2019s subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to their respective stockholders could materially adversely limit the Blue Impact business\u2019 ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to its businesses or otherwise fund and conduct its business, any of which could materially adversely affect the Blue Impact business\u2019, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSubsequent to the Closing, the Blue Impact business may be required to take writedowns or writeoffs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges that could materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nLegacy cannot assure you that the due diligence it conducted on the Blue Impact business revealed all material issues that may be present in the Blue Impact business, that it would uncover all material issues through customary due diligence, or that factors outside of Legacy\u2019s and the Blue Impact business\u2019 control will not later arise. As a result, the Blue Impact business may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with Legacy\u2019s preliminary risk analyses. Even though these charges may be noncash items and not have an immediate impact on the liquidity of the Blue Impact business, the incurrence of charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Blue Impact business or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause the Blue Impact business to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe Blue Impact business\u2019 ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in the ownership of its equity over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. It is expected that Legacy will experience such an ownership change related to the business combination, and the Blue Impact business may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of changes in the ownership of its stock, which may be outside the Blue Impact business\u2019 control. the Blue Impact business\u2019 ability to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by an \u201cownership change,\u201d which could result in increased tax liability to the Blue Impact business, potentially decreasing the value of its stock. There are additional limitations found under Sections 269, 383, and 384 of the Code that may also limit the use of net operating loss carryforwards that may apply and result in increased tax liability to the Blue Impact business, potentially decreasing the value of its stock. In addition, a \u201cSeparate Return Limitation Year\u201d (\u201cSRLY\u201d) generally encompasses all separate return years of a member (or predecessor in a Section 381 or other transaction), including tax years in which it joins a consolidated return of another group. According to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-21, a net operating losses of a member that arises in a SRLY may be applied against consolidated taxable income only to the extent of the loss member\u2019s cumulative contribution to the consolidated taxable income. As a result, this SRLY limitation may also increase the tax liability to the Blue Impact business (by reducing the carryforward of certain net operating losses that otherwise might be used to offset the amount of taxable gain), potentially decreasing the value of Blue Impact\u2019s stock.\nLegacy will be forced to liquidate the trust account if it cannot consummate a business combination by the deadline imposed by its amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nPursuant to Legacy\u2019s charter (as amended pursuant to the Extension Amendment), Legacy must complete its initial business combination by March 21, 2020 (subject to up to two remaining extensions to May 20, 2020 in accordance with the Extension Amendment). If Legacy is unable to timely complete a business combination by the deadline established pursuant to the Extension Amendment, Legacy will be forced to liquidate and distribute the remaining funds in the trust account to its stockholders pro rata, which may be less than $10 per share. Furthermore, the Warrants will expire without payment or other value.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock.\nThe Share Exchange Agreement requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, which increases the probability that our business combination would be unsuccessful. If our business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market.\nLegacy\u2019s Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares from public stockholders, which may influence the vote on the business combination and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of Legacy\u2019s stock.\nLegacy\u2019s Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of the business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of Legacy\u2019s shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that Legacy\u2019s Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or of satisfying the minimum cash closing condition in the Share Exchange Agreement, where it appears that such condition would otherwise not be satisfied. This may result in the completion of the business combination where such completion would not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of Legacy\u2019s common stock and the number of beneficial holders of its securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the listing or trading of its securities on a national securities exchange.\nThere is no guarantee that a stockholder\u2019s decision whether to redeem its shares in Legacy for a pro rata portion of the trust account will put the stockholder in a better future economic position.\nLegacy can give no assurance as to the price at which a stockholder may be able to sell its public shares in the future following the completion of the business combination or any alternative business combination. Certain events following the consummation of any business combination, including the business combination, may cause an increase in Legacy\u2019s stock price, and may result in a lower value realized now than a stockholder of Legacy might realize in the future had the stockholder not elected to redeem such stockholder\u2019s shares. Similarly, if a stockholder does not redeem its shares, the stockholder will bear the risk of ownership of the public shares after the consummation of any business combination, and there can be no assurance that a stockholder can sell its shares in the future for a greater amount than the redemption price set forth in this proxy statement.\nIf a Legacy stockholder fails to receive notice of Legacy\u2019s offer to redeem its public shares in connection with the business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\nHolders of Legacy\u2019s public shares are required to affirmatively vote either for or against the business combination in order to exercise their rights to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account. In addition, in order to exercise their redemption rights, they are required to submit a request in writing and deliver their stock (either physically or electronically) to Legacy\u2019s transfer agent at least two business days prior to the special meeting. If, despite Legacy\u2019s compliance with the proxy rules, a stockholder fails to receive the proxy materials, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its public shares. In addition, the proxy materials that Legacy is furnishing to holders of its public shares in connection with the business combination describes the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem public shares. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed.\nIf you are a non-U.S. Holder, you may be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the redemption.\nLegacy stockholders who exercise their redemption rights to receive cash from the trust account in exchange for their Legacy shares generally will be required to treat the transaction as a sale of such shares. The redemption, however, may be treated as a distribution if it does not effect a meaningful reduction in the redeeming stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in Legacy. It is important to note that the Section 318 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) attribution or constructive ownership of stock rules apply when testing redemption treatment under Section 302(b). If there is attribution sufficient to cause the redemption to be treated instead under the Section 301 distribution rules which breaks nonliquidating corporate distributions into a dividend (to the extent of Legacy\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits), a nontaxable return of capital, and any remaining portion treated as a gain from the sale of Legacy shares. If you are a non-U.S. Holder, you may be subject to withholding tax on any part of the redemption treated as a dividend, which may include the full amount of the redemption.\nLegacy\u2019s current stockholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of shares in the Blue Impact business as consideration in the business combination. Having a minority share position may reduce the influence that Legacy\u2019s current stockholders have on the management of the Blue Impact business following the business combination.\nAfter the business combination, assuming no redemptions of shares in Legacy for cash and excluding any shares that may be issued pursuant to the Purchase Price Adjustment, Legacy\u2019s current public stockholders will own approximately 43.87% of the Blue Impact business, Legacy\u2019s current directors, officers and affiliates will own approximately 11.23% of the Blue Impact business, and BlueFocus will own approximately 44.9% of the Blue Impact business. Assuming redemption by holders of 60.2% of Legacy\u2019s outstanding shares, Legacy\u2019s current public stockholders will own approximately 25.68% of the Blue Impact business, Legacy\u2019s current directors, officers and affiliates will own approximately 8.26% of the Blue Impact business, and BlueFocus will own approximately 66.06% of the Blue Impact business. The minority position of the former Legacy stockholders will give them limited influence over the management and operations of the Blue Impact business following the business combination.\nLegacy\u2019s current stockholders will experience significant dilution if the public warrants or the private placement warrant are exercised.\nAfter the business combination, and assuming no redemptions of shares in Legacy for cash, there is no Blue Impact Warrant Tender Offer and excluding any shares that may be issued pursuant to the Purchase Price Adjustment, Legacy\u2019s current public stockholders will own public warrants representing approximately 14.04% of Blue Impact on a fully-diluted basis, and the Sponsor will own the private placement warrant representing approximately 16.38% of Blue Impact on a fully-diluted basis. If the public warrants or the private placement warrant are exercised, Legacy\u2019s current stockholders will experience significant dilution.\nIf, after Legacy distributes the proceeds in the trust account to its public stockholders, it files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against it that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of Legacy\u2019s board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to Legacy\u2019s creditors, thereby exposing it and the members of its board of directors to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, after Legacy distributes the proceeds in the trust account to its public stockholders, it files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against it that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by its stockholders. In addition, Legacy\u2019s board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to Legacy\u2019s creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing Legacy and the board of directors to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to its public stockholders, Legacy files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against it that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of Legacy\u2019s stockholders and the per share amount that would otherwise be received by Legacy\u2019s stockholders in connection with its liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to its public stockholders, Legacy files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against it that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in Legacy\u2019s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of its stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share amount that would otherwise be received by Legacy\u2019s stockholders in connection with its liquidation may be reduced.\nIf third parties bring claims against Legacy, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nLegacy\u2019s placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against Legacy. Although Legacy will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which it does business execute agreements waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of Legacy\u2019s public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against Legacy\u2019s assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, Legacy\u2019s management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to Legacy than any alternative. We are not aware of any product or service providers who have not or will not provide such waiver other than the underwriters of our initial public offering and our independent public accounting firm WithumSmith+Brown, PC.\nExamples of possible instances where Legacy may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by Legacy\u2019s management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where Legacy\u2019s management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Legacy and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of Legacy\u2019s public shares, if Legacy is unable to complete its business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with the business combination, Legacy will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against it within the ten years following redemption. Accordingly, the per share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Legacy\u2019s Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to Legacy if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to Legacy, or a prospective target business with which Legacy has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes and up to $750,000 of interest to fund working capital requirements annually, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Legacy\u2019s Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. Legacy has not independently verified whether its Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that its Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of Legacy. Legacy has not asked its Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, Legacy cannot assure you that its Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.\nLegacy\u2019s directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of its Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to its public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share or (ii) other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, such lesser amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes and up to $750,000 to fund working capital requirements annually, and Legacy\u2019s Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, Legacy\u2019s independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against its Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While Legacy currently expects that its independent directors would take legal action on its behalf against its Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations, it is possible that Legacy\u2019s independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If Legacy\u2019s independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to Legacy\u2019s public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders are entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the Outside Extended Date or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by the Outside Extended Date, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nThe NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur units are listed on the NYSE and began trading on November 16, 2017. On November 27, 2017, we announced that holders of our Units could elect to separately trade the Class A common stock and Warrants included in the Units. On November 30, 2017, our Class A common stock and Warrants began trading on the NYSE under the symbols \u201cLGC\u201d and \u201cLGC WS,\u201d respectively. We cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be, listed on the NYSE in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on the NYSE prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum number of holders of our securities (400 roundlot shareholders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE\u2019s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4 per share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our Class A common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our units and our Class A common stock and warrants are listed on the NYSE, our units, Class A common stock and warrants are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the state of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nThe Blue Impact business will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed on the NYSE, which it may not be able to do. Even if Blue Impact\u2019s securities are so listed, Blue Impact may be unable to maintain the listing in the future.\nIf, following the business combination, Blue Impact fails to meet the initial listing requirements and the NYSE does not list its securities on its exchange, Blue Impact could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the Blue Impact business; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAny of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the Blue Impact business\u2019, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\nSince the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete the business combination with Blue Valor, , we may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 following the completion of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if our initial public offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of our investments, and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf registration as an investment company;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading \u201cinvestment securities\u201d constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Because the investment of the proceeds will be restricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by the Outside Extended Date may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24th month from the closing of our initial public offering in the event we do not complete our business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures.\nBecause we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by the Outside Extended Date is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.\nWe did not register, and are not registering, the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\nWe did not register, and are not registering, the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our reasonable best efforts to file, and within sixty (60) business days after the closing of our initial business combination, to have declared effective, a registration statement relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and to maintain a current prospectus relating to such shares of Class A common stock until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full Unit purchase price solely for the shares of Class A common stock included in the units. We may not redeem the warrants when a holder may not exercise such warrants. However, there may be instances in which holders of our public warrants may be unable to exercise such public warrants but holders of our private warrants may be able to exercise such private warrants.\nThe grant of registration rights to our initial stockholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nPursuant to an agreement entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in our initial public offering, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register their founder shares after those shares convert to shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private placement warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants, and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities.\nIn connection with the Share Exchange Agreement, Legacy\u2019s registration rights agreement with the Sponsor will be amended and restated (the \u201cAmended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) to provide the Sponsor and the Seller with registration rights with respect to certain shares of their Blue Impact common stock. The registrable shares will be comprised of Sponsor\u2019s shares of common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the founder\u2019s shares, private placement warrants, and working capital loans (if any), or issued or issuable with respect to the Redemption Side Letter, the Seller\u2019s shares of common stock issued or issuable pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, and any other shares of common stock held respectively by the Sponsor or the Seller as of the date of Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement or issued or issuable in respect of such shares of the Sponsor the Seller pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend or in connection with a combination, merger, share exchange, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, the Sponsor and the Seller will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights and Form S-3 registration rights, subject to certain minimum requirements and customary conditions. However, the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period under the Investor Rights Agreement. In addition, Blue Impact will be obligated to file, after it becomes eligible to use Form S-3 or its successor form, a shelf registration statement to register the resale by the Sponsor or the Seller of their registrable shares. The Sponsor and the Seller will be entitled to assign their registration rights under the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement to transferees who acquire at least 1% of the outstanding registrable shares or to Founder Investors or Non-Founder Investors under the investor rights agreement to be entered into at the closing of the business combination.\nThe registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for similar registration rights for their shares.\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors, at least until we have completed our business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nOur ability to successfully effect our business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the completion of our business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\nThe Blue Impact business\u2019 management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nNone of the current members of the Blue Impact business\u2019 management team have experience managing a U.S. publicly-traded company, and most do not have experience interacting with public company investors and complying with the complex laws, rules and regulations that govern public companies. The management team in place following the business combination may not be able to successfully or efficiently manage the Blue Impact business\u2019 transition to being a public company.\nAs a public company, the Blue Impact business will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the NYSE Rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that a company maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures (\u201cDCP\u201d) and internal controls over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d). The management team\u2019s limited experience operating a public company may result in operational inefficiencies or errors, or a failure to improve or maintain effective ICFR and DCP necessary to ensure timely and accurate reporting of operational and financial results. To date, the Blue Impact business\u2019 management team has not had to conduct a review of its DCP and ICFR for the purposes of such reporting requirements, and the Blue Impact business\u2019 management team will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives and may need to add personnel in areas such as accounting, financial reporting, investor relations and legal in connection with operations as a public company. For example, the Blue Impact business is in discussions with a candidate with public company financial reporting experience to become its CFO following the Closing. Ensuring that the Blue Impact business has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently. the Blue Impact business\u2019 compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), the Blue Impact business will be required to furnish certain certifications and reports by its management on its ICFR, which, after it is no longer an emerging growth company, must be accompanied by an attestation report on ICFR issued by its independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, the Blue Impact business will document and evaluate its ICFR, which is both costly and challenging. Implementing any appropriate changes to its internal controls may require specific compliance training for Blue Impact\u2019s directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify its existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of its ICFR, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase its operating costs and could materially impair its ability to operate its business. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for the Blue Impact business to produce reliable and timely financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. Any failure by the Blue Impact business to file its periodic reports in a timely manner may cause investors to lose confidence in its reported financial information and may lead to a decline in the price of its common stock.\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which they may be entitled to substantial compensation and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. For a complete discussion of our executive officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs, please see \u201cItem 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\u201d\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nSince our sponsor, executive officers and directors will not be eligible to be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses if our business combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may have arisen in determining whether a Blue Valor is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nAt the closing of our initial business combination, our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will not be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf. These financial interests of our sponsor, executive officers and directors may have influenced their motivation in identifying and selecting Blue Valor as the target for business combination.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of December 31, 2019 to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following our initial public offering, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our business combination. We have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per-share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u25cf default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;\n\u25cf our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;\n\u25cf our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;\n\u25cf using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u25cf limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nThe net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement of warrants provided us with $289,500,000 that we may use to complete our business combination (excluding up to $10,500,000 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account).\nWe may effectuate our business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u25cf solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset, or\n\u25cf dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our business combination.\nThe Blue Impact business is a group of subsidiaries of Blue Focus Intelligent Communications Group, about which little information is available, which may result in our business combination being not as profitable as we expect it to be.\nThe Blue Impact business is a group of subsidiaries of Blue Focus Intelligent Communications Group, a privately held company that is not subject to the same financial disclosure requirements as a publicly traded company. Consequently, very little public information exists about Blue Focus Intelligent Communications Group and its subsidiaries, which may mean that the business combination is not as profitable as we expect it to be, if at all.\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete a business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (such that we become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. As a result, we may be able to complete our business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\nThe exercise price for the public warrants is higher than in many similar blank check company offerings in the past, and, accordingly, the warrants are more likely to expire worthless.\nThe exercise price of the public warrants is higher than is typical in many similar blank check companies in the past. Historically, the exercise price of a warrant was generally a fraction of the purchase price of the units in the initial public offering. The exercise price for our public warrants is $5.75 per half share, or $11.50 per whole share. As a result, the warrants are less likely to ever be in the money and more likely to expire worthless.\nThe provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) will provide that it may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support.\nSome other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company\u2019s pre-business combination activity, without approval by a certain percentage of the company\u2019s stockholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions requires approval by between 90% and 100% of the company\u2019s public stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock. In all other instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that it may be amended by holders of a majority of our common stock, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. We may not issue additional securities that can vote on charter amendments. Our initial stockholders, who will beneficially own 20% of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering, will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which will govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nCertain agreements related to our initial public offering may be amended without stockholder approval.\nCertain agreements, including the underwriting agreement relating to our initial public offering, the investment management trust agreement between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the letter agreement among us and our sponsor, officers, directors and director nominees, the registration rights agreement among us and our initial stockholders and the administrative services agreement between us and our sponsor, may be amended without stockholder approval. These agreements contain various provisions that our public stockholders might deem to be material. For example, the underwriting agreement related to our initial public offering contains (i) a representation that we will not consummate any public or private equity or debt financing prior to the consummation of a business combination, unless all investors in such financing expressly waive, in writing, any rights in or claims against the trust account and (ii) a covenant that the target company that we acquire must have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of signing the definitive agreement for the transaction with such target business (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) so long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE. While we do not expect our board to approve any amendment to any of these agreements prior to our initial business combination, it may be possible that our board, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to any such agreement in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Any such amendment may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities.\nOur initial stockholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. Further, certain institutional investors may have different interests than other public stockholders.\nImmediately following the closing of our initial public offering, our initial stockholders owned 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.\nAccordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of major corporate transactions. If our initial stockholders purchase any additional shares of common stock in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their influence.\nNeither our initial stockholders nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any intention as of the date of this Form 10-K to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in this Form 10-K. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our sponsor, is and will be divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. Following our first annual meeting on December 31, 2019, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only half of the board of directors was considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, had considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our business combination.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants.\nOur warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. We may not redeem the warrants when a holder may not exercise such warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our business combination.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 15,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock as part of the units offered in our initial public offering and private placement warrants, exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 8,750,000 shares of our Class A common stock, in a private placement. In addition, if our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors make any working capital loans, up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. To the extent we issue shares of Class A common stock to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, if and when exercised, would increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and reduce the value of the shares of Class A common stock issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\nThe private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in our initial public offering except that, so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination; (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (iv) the founder shares are subject to registration rights. In addition, for as long as the private placement warrants are held by Loop Capital Markets LLC or its designees or affiliates, they may not be exercised after five years from the effective date of the registration statement for our initial public offering.\nBecause each warrant is exercisable for only one-half of one share of our Class A common stock, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.\nEach warrant is exercisable for one-half of one share of Class A common stock. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of units must sell any odd number of warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional interest that will not be issued. Nevertheless, this Unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if it included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nThe market for our securities is volatile and may not develop further, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nFollowing our initial public offering, the price of our securities has varied significantly. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, each within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. Additionally, we are also a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the SEC\u2019s amended definition of a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d As a result, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and not being required to present selected financial data and only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Even if we age out of our status as an emerging growth company after five years, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, including if either (a) the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates falls below $250 million as of June 30 of any year, or (b) we have less than $80 million of revenues for the prior fiscal year and the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $560 million as of June 30 of such year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing such suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. This provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nAn investment in our initial public offering may result in uncertain or adverse United States federal income tax consequences.\nAn investment in our initial public offering may result in uncertain United States federal income tax consequences. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address instruments similar to the units we issued in our initial public offering, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a Unit between the share of common stock and the warrant to purchase one share of common stock included in each Unit could be challenged by the IRS or the courts. Furthermore, the United States federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant included in the units is unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our shares of common stock suspend the running of a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized by such holder on the sale or exchange of common stock is long-term capital gain or loss and for determining whether any dividend we pay would be considered \u201cqualified dividends\u201d for federal income tax purposes. See the section titled \u201cTaxation\u201d for a summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences of an investment in our securities. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these and other tax consequences when purchasing, holding or disposing of our securities.\nGlobal business risks and costs could materially adversely affect the Blue Impact business.\nThe Blue Impact business is a global business that as of September 30, 2019 has operations in 13 countries, spanning across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. A global platform subjects the Blue Impact business to many challenges associated with supporting a rapidly growing business across a multitude of cultures and customs, including:\n\u25cf higher costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations and complying with varying tax, monetary, commercial, legal and regulatory systems and infrastructures;\n\u25cf pressure on its ability to efficiently provide its clients with integrated service offerings;\n\u25cf laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u25cf rates of inflation;\n\u25cf cultural and language differences;\n\u25cf local labor and employment regulations;\n\u25cf tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u25cf differing protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf varying social, political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf greater exposure to civil disturbances, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and wars; and\n\u25cf potential government appropriation of assets.\nThe Blue Impact business\u2019 ability to manage its business and conduct its operations globally thus requires considerable attention and resources. The Blue Impact business may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If it is unable to do so, its operations might suffer, which may adversely impact its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe Blue Impact business\u2019 global business also subjects it to the impact of global and regional recessions, especially in the regions in which it operates, and economic and political instability, including those arising as a result of the U.K.\u2019s anticipated exit from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), recent political unrest in Hong Kong and trade disputes such as that between the United States and China. The Blue Impact business is also subject to the costs and difficulties in managing a distributed workforce. The Blue Impact business\u2019 failure to manage the foregoing risks and challenges successfully could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could adversely affect the Blue Impact business. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions have limited value as precedents. Since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties. Since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting, implementing and enforcing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection that Madhouse and the Blue Impact business\u2019 other operations in China may enjoy than some more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may affect the Blue Impact business\u2019 decisions on the policies and actions to be taken to comply with Chinese laws and regulations, and may affect its ability to enforce its contractual rights or tort claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits from the Blue Impact business.\nFurthermore, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have a retroactive effect. As a result, the Blue Impact business may not be aware of its violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nAdditionally, laws regarding foreign investments may impact the Blue Impact business\u2019 plan to expand its geographic reach. For example, the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cM&A Rules\u201d), adopted by six Chinese regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. Such regulation requires, among other things, that the competent regulatory authorities such as the Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (\u201cSAMR\u201d) be notified in advance of any change of control transaction in which a foreign investor acquires control of a Chinese domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or Chinese time honored brand. In the future, the Blue Impact business may seek to acquire complementary businesses in China. Complying with the requirements of the M&A Rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval from MOFCOM and SAMR, may delay or inhibit the Blue Impact business\u2019 ability to complete such transactions, which could materially adversely affect its ability to expand its business or maintain its Chinese market share. In addition, antitrust filings with SAMR would also be required for deals in which the parties involved satisfy reporting threshold under Chinese law and any such filings will also be very time consuming.\nMoreover, post-Closing, Blue Impact\u2019s operations and actions may also be subject to additional restrictions or approval requirements given Blue Valor\u2019s direct, and in turn BlueFocus\u2019s indirect, post-Closing ownership interest in Blue Impact and ability to nominate Blue Impact directors. BlueFocus is organized in China and its shares are traded in China on the SSE. As a result, Blue Impact will be considered a controlled company for the purposes of PRC regulations and the rules of the SSE, and certain corporate actions proposed to be undertaken by Blue Impact will require reporting to and approval of BlueFocus. For example, in the context of a proposed future acquisition of a U.S. business, these restrictions or approval requirements may require (i) making specified security filings in the United States. (ii) obtaining any required clearances or implementing remedial measures or other safeguards as a condition to receiving any required approval and (iii) for larger acquisitions (in the United States or otherwise) receiving approval from BlueFocus\u2019s board of directors and, for much larger acquisitions, possibly receiving approval from BlueFocus\u2019s shareholders. Any failure by Blue Impact to comply with such rules and regulations, or to obtain the required approval from BlueFocus\u2019s board of directors or shareholders, could prevent or delay Blue Impact from consummating proposed corporate actions.\nAny of the foregoing, to the extent it affects the Blue Impact business, could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Blue Impact business.", "PERMNO": 17090, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "LGC"}
