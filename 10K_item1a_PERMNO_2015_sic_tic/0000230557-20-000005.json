{"cik": "230557", "company": "SELECTIVE INSURANCE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAny of the following risk factors could (i) significantly impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings, and (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. At this time, these are the significant risk factors which might affect, alter, or change our actions in executing our long-term capital strategy. These actions include, but are not limited to, contributing capital to any or all of the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt or equity securities, repurchasing our equity securities, repurchasing our existing debt, or increasing or decreasing stockholders\u2019 dividends.\nRisks Related to our Insurance Operations\nWe are subject to losses from catastrophic events.\nOur financial results can be significantly negatively impacted by losses from natural and man-made catastrophes including, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, floods, and fires, some of\nwhich may be related to climate change, and terrorism, including cyber-attacks and explosions. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. In recent years, the global insurance industry has seen an escalation in losses from catastrophes.\nThe United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u201cIPCC\u201d) is an international body responsible for assessing climate change science. In 2018, the IPCC reported that human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.8\u00b0F of global warming above pre-industrial levels and that, if the trend continues at the current rate, it will reach 2.7\u00b0F above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. Climate change models project robust differences in global regional climate characteristics between 1.8\u00b0F and global warming of 2.7\u00b0F up to 3.6\u00b0F. These differences, whether attributable to human activities or natural, include increases in (i) mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions, (iii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions. These differences and increases can impact weather patterns and the frequency and severity of catastrophes.\nOur insurance operations primarily write risks in the Eastern, Midwestern, and Southwestern regions of the U.S., and our most significant catastrophe exposures are (i) hurricanes impacting the Eastern U.S., (ii) terrorism events, and (iii) severe convective storms, including tornadoes. Single storms could adversely impact our financial results, but it is also possible that we could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given calendar year. We track our severe weather and catastrophe losses using definitions and information we obtain from ISO\u2019s Property Claim Services unit, an internationally recognized expert on U.S. and U.S.-territory storm losses.\nCertain factors can impact our estimates of ultimate costs for catastrophes. Among these factors are the following:\n\u2022\nInability to access portions of the impacted areas following a catastrophic event;\n\u2022\nScarcity of necessary labor and materials that delay repairs and increase our loss costs;\n\u2022\nRegulatory uncertainties, including new or expanded interpretations of coverage;\n\u2022\nResidual market assessment-related increases in our catastrophe losses;\n\u2022\nPotential fraud and unscrupulous contractors inflating repair costs;\n\u2022\nHigher loss adjustment expenses due to shortages of claims adjusters available to appraise damage;\n\u2022\nLate claims reporting;\n\u2022\nEscalation of business interruption costs due to infrastructure disruption; and\n\u2022\nWhether the U.S. Secretary of Treasury certifies that a terrorist event is an act of terrorism under TRIPRA.\nAn increase in catastrophe losses could reduce our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt ratings. In addition, if a catastrophe occurs near the end of a reporting period, it is possible we may have limited information available to estimate loss and loss expense reserves, which adds greater uncertainty. More detailed claims information may become available later, resulting in reserve changes in subsequent periods.\nOur loss and loss expense reserves may not be adequate to cover actual losses and expenses.\nWe maintain reserves for our estimated liability for loss and loss expense associated with reported and unreported insurance claims. We base our estimates of loss and loss expense reserve amounts on known facts and circumstances, including our expectations of ultimate settlement and claim administration expenses, trends in claims severity and frequency, medical inflation trends, predictions of future events, and other subjective factors relating to our in-force insurance policies. There is no method for precisely estimating the ultimate liability for the settlement of claims.\nReserve estimates may be impacted by a variety of broad economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends, such as inflation, judicial tort decisions, and various state legislative initiatives. Because of our inability to predict the timing and impact of these economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends, and the inherent uncertainty in estimating loss and loss expense reserves, we cannot be certain that the reserves we establish are adequate or will be so in the future.\nWe regularly review our reserve adequacy and increase reserves if we believe they are inadequate or reduce them if we believe they are redundant. An increase in reserves (i) reduces net income and stockholders\u2019 equity for the period in which the reserves are increased, and (ii) could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt ratings. As we underwrite new business and renew existing business in future periods, we estimate future loss cost trends to help price our products to generate an adequate risk-adjusted return. To the extent our estimate of future loss cost trends proves to be understated, the pricing of our future new business and renewal business could be inadequate to meet estimated loss costs trends, which could result in our future loss and loss expense reserves being understated.\nThree examples of how reserves might be affected by economic, political, social, or legal developments or trends:\n\u2022\nIf economic inflation is higher than our assumptions, our loss and loss expense reserves associated with our longer tail lines of business may prove to be insufficient. In particular, our workers compensation line of business is susceptible to this risk, given its extended payment pattern, and the current low medical inflationary environment compared to longer term medical inflation rates, which have historically been higher.\n\u2022\nState legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use may significantly impact future claims emergence if marijuana use drives higher claims frequencies or severities.\n\u2022\nSeveral states have expanded or are exploring expanding the statute of limitations for civil actions alleging sexual abuse. By retroactively permitting claims for previously time-barred acts, these \u201creviver\u201d laws may result in insurance claims that could significantly increase loss costs and require re-evaluation of previously-established reserves or the creation of new reserves. Since reviver statutes have been enacted, we have received notices of claims or potential claims for acts alleged to have occurred as far back as the 1950s. With no prior experience, we cannot estimate how many \"reviver\" claims notices we may receive. Most notices we have received are sent on behalf of claimants by attorneys unsure of what insurer or policy (if any) may have covered the alleged assailant or supervising entity and may not implicate insurance policies issued by us or a predecessor. For notices we have determined implicate an insured under a policy issued by us or a predecessor, we (i) have investigated or are investigating facts, (ii) have evaluated policy terms, and (iii) believe we have appropriate coverage defenses and reinsurance protections that have been considered in establishing our reserves. As coverage positions may be challenged through litigation or otherwise, we face litigation risks further discussed below in the Risk Factor entitled, \u201cIncidental to our insurance operations, we are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings that, because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\u201d\nFor further discussion on our loss and loss expense reserves, please see the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d section of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to reduce our risk exposure depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance.\nWe transfer a significant portion of our underwriting risk exposure - specifically a portion of our loss and loss expense - to reinsurance companies in exchange for a specified portion of premiums. Most of our reinsurance contracts have annual terms. The availability, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions, including the capacity of the retrocessional reinsurance market. This may fluctuate significantly and not necessarily correlate to the loss experience of our specific book of business. In general, reinsurance expense can be considered in our rating of insurance premium for our customers. Any increase in our reinsurance expense that cannot be passed on to our policyholders through rate increases will reduce our earnings. If we are unable to obtain reinsurance in amounts or on terms that we expected, our reinsurance expenses could increase, we may assume increased risk for individual or aggregate losses, and our ability to write future business could be adversely affected.\nCatastrophes impact a variety of property and casualty insurance lines, but historically commercial property and homeowners coverages have accounted for most of our catastrophe-related claims. To limit our exposure to catastrophe losses, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance. Catastrophe reinsurance could prove inadequate to our exposures if (i) we purchase an inadequate amount of reinsurance because of deficiencies or inaccuracies in the various modeling software programs we use to analyze the risk of the Insurance Subsidiaries, (ii) a major catastrophe loss exceeds the reinsurance limit or the financial capacity of one or more of our reinsurers, (iii) the frequency of catastrophe losses results in our Insurance Subsidiaries exceeding the aggregate limits under the catastrophe reinsurance treaty, or (iv) our reinsurance counterparties (a) are unable to access their reinsurance markets, or retrocessions, (b) suffer significant financial losses, (c) are sold, (d) cease writing reinsurance business, or (e) are unable or unwilling to satisfy their contractual obligations to us. Even with the benefits of reinsurance, our exposure to catastrophe risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe may be subject to potentially significant losses from acts of terrorism.\nWe are required to participate in TRIPRA, which was extended to December 31, 2027, for our Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines business. TRIPRA rescinded all previously-approved coverage exclusions for terrorism and requires private insurers and the U.S. government to share the risk of loss on future acts of terrorism certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Under TRIPRA, each participating insurer is responsible for paying a significant deductible of specified losses before federal assistance is available. Our deductible of $359 million is based on a percentage of our prior year\u2019s applicable\nStandard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines premiums. For losses above the deductible in 2020, the federal government will pay 80% of losses to an industry limit of $100 billion, and the insurer retains 20%. Although TRIPRA\u2019s provisions provide some mitigation to our loss exposure to a large-scale terrorist attack, our deductible could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. If the U.S. Secretary of Treasury does not certify certain future terrorist events, as was the case with the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the 2015 San Bernardino shootings, we could be required to pay terrorism-related covered losses without TRIPRA's risk-sharing benefits.\nUnder TRIPRA, terrorism coverage is mandatory for all primary workers compensation policies. TRIPRA also applies to cyber liability insurance policies reported under a Terrorism Risk Insurance Program-eligible line of insurance. Insureds with non-workers compensation commercial policies have the option to accept or decline our terrorism coverage or negotiate with us for other terms. In 2019, 87% of our Standard Commercial Lines non-workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage that included nuclear, biological, chemical, and radioactive (\"NBCR\") events.\nMany of the states in which we write commercial property insurance mandate that we cover fire following an act of terrorism - regardless of whether the insured opted to purchase terrorism coverage. We also sometimes elect to provide terrorism coverage for lines of business not included in TRIPRA, such as Commercial Automobile. Personal lines of business have never been covered under TRIPRA. Homeowners policies we offer in Standard Personal Lines exclude nuclear losses but do not exclude biological or chemical losses. Our current reinsurance programs generally provide coverage for conventional acts of foreign and domestic terrorism, but afford no coverage for NBCR events.\nWe are exposed to credit risk.\nWe have credit risk in several areas of our insurance operations, including from:\n\u2022\nOur reinsurers, which are obligated to make payments to us under our reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance credit risk can fluctuate over time, increasing during periods of high catastrophe loss activity. Reinsurers generally manage their large loss exposure through their own reinsurance programs, known as retrocessions, to which we sometimes do not have full visibility. If our reinsurers experience any difficulty in collecting on their retrocession programs, or in reinstating retrocession coverage after a large loss, it could impede timely and full payment of our reinsurance claims. This means that we have direct and indirect counterparty credit risk from our reinsurers, which operate in a relatively small global community.\n\u2022\nCertain life insurance companies from which we have purchased annuities for our customers under structured claims settlement agreements, if they fail to fulfill their obligations under the annuity contracts.\n\u2022\nSome of our distribution partners, who we allow to collect premiums due to us from our customers.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers, who are obligated to make premium and/or deductible payments directly to us.\n\u2022\nThe invested assets in our defined benefit plan. If financial risk adversely impacts the valuation and performance of the invested assets in our defined benefit plan, the funded status of the defined benefit plan could be negatively impacted and the plan's expense, and our obligation to fund it, could increase.\nOur exposure to credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe depend on distribution partners.\nWe market and sell our insurance products through independent, non-employee distribution partners. Insurance law and regulation makes us responsible for the business practices and customer interactions of our distribution partners. Independent distribution partners have, and we expect will continue to have, a significant role in overall insurance industry. While our customers find advantages in using independent distribution partners, our reliance on independent distribution partners presents risks and challenges, including the following:\n\u2022\nAs independent distribution partners have access to products from multiple carriers and markets, we face competition in our distribution channel and must market our products and services to our distribution partners before they sell them to our mutual customers.\n\u2022\nOur customers rely on our independent distribution partners, and some customers do not differentiate between their insurance agent and their insurance carrier. Developing brand recognition, particularly with these types of customers can be challenging and requires us to coordinate with our distribution partners.\n\u2022\nGrowth in our market share is principally dependent on growth in the market share controlled by our distribution partners. Independent retail insurance agencies control 84% of standard commercial lines business and 35% of standard personal lines business in the U.S. Consequently, expansion of our Standard Personal Lines market opportunity could be more limited than our Standard Commercial Lines business. To address the discrepancy in agency control of Standard Personal Lines business, more competitors have focused on lower-cost \"direct-to-the-customer\" distribution models that emphasize digital ease and technological efficiencies. Continued advancements in \"direct-to-the-customer\" distribution models may impact the overall market share controlled by our independent distribution partners and make it more difficult for us to grow, or require us to establish relationships with more distribution partners.\n\u2022\nOver the past several years, some publicly-traded and private equity-backed independent distribution partners have employed consolidation strategies to acquire other independent distribution partners and increase their market share (\"Aggregators\"). As more of our independent distribution partners become Aggregators, or are acquired by Aggregators, their influence and demands on our business could increase. It is possible that Aggregators could develop and implement strategies to consolidate their business with fewer insurance carriers and demand higher base and supplemental commissions. Aggregators accounted for approximately 28% of our DPW at December 31, 2019. Currently, no one distribution partner is responsible for 10% or more of our combined insurance operations' premium.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the success of our independent distribution partners in marketing and selling our products and services.\nNational and global economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth.\nUnfavorable economic developments could adversely affect our earnings if our customers have less need for insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify coverage, or choose not to renew with us. An economic downturn could also lead to increased credit and premium receivable risk, the failure of reinsurance counterparties and other financial institutions, limitations on our ability to issue new debt, reduced liquidity, and declines in the fair value of our financial strength. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth. During 2019, 31% of DPW in our Standard Commercial Lines business was based on payroll/sales of our underlying customers. An economic downturn in which our customers experience declines in revenue or employee count could adversely affect our audit and endorsement premium in our Standard Commercial Lines.\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant financial strength rating downgrade, particularly from A.M. Best, would affect our ability to write new or renewal business with customers, some of whom are required under various third-party agreements to maintain insurance with a carrier with a specified minimum rating. In addition, downgrades in our credit ratings could make it more expensive for us to access capital markets. We cannot predict the possible rating actions NRSROs might take that could adversely affect our business or our potential actions in response. Any significant downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. For additional information on our current financial strength and credit ratings, refer to \"Overview\" in Item 1. \"Business.\" of this Form 10-K.\nMarkets for insurance products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe offer our insurance products and services in a highly competitive market characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product pricing based on performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and services to the marketplace through digital platforms.\nWe face substantial competition from a wide range of property and casualty insurance companies for customers, distribution partners, and employees. Competitors include public, private, and mutual insurance companies. Many competitors are larger and may have lower operating costs, lower cost of capital, or the ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings. Other competitors, such as mutual or reciprocal companies, are cooperatively owned by insureds and do not have shareholders who evaluate return on equity performance. Consequently, some competitors may be able to price their products more competitively.\nBecause of its relatively low cost of entry, the Internet has emerged as a significant competitive new marketplace where existing and new competitors have platforms. Established insurance competitors, such as Chubb Limited and The Progressive Corporation, are beginning to explore broader offerings through this digital platform, while new insurance competitors, such as Lemonade and Next, continue to emerge. Reinsurers also have entered certain primary property and casualty insurance markets to diversify their operations and compete with us. Because the Internet makes it easier to bundle products and services, it is also possible that companies conducting business on the Internet could enter the insurance business in the future or form strategic alliances with insurers. Changes in competitors and competition, particularly on the Internet, could cause changes in the supply or demand for insurance and adversely affect our business.\nWe have less loss experience data than our larger competitors.\nInsurers rely on access to reliable data about their customers and loss experience to build complex analytics and predictive models that assess risk profitability, reserve adequacy, adverse claim development potential, recovery opportunities, fraudulent activities, and customer buying habits. We expect the use of data science and analytics will continue to increase and become more complex and accurate, particularly with the use of larger amounts of relevant data. Some of our larger competitors have significantly larger volumes of data about the performance of the risks they have underwritten. It is possible that the loss experience from our insurance operations may not be sufficiently large or granular in all circumstances to analyze and project our future costs as accurately as our larger competitors. To supplement our data, we use industry loss experience data from ISO, AAIS, and NCCI. While relevant, industry data may not correlate specifically to the performance of risks we have underwritten and may not be as predictive as if we had more data from a larger book of our own business. Because we use and rely on the aggregated industry loss data assembled by ISO, AAIS, NCCI and other similar rating bureaus under the anti-trust exemptions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we likely would be at a competitive disadvantage to larger insurers with more loss experience data on their book of business if Congress repealed the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\nWe are subject to a variety of modeling risks that could have a material adverse impact on our business results.\nWe rely on internally and third-party developed complex financial models, such as those that predict (i) underwriting results on individual risks and our overall portfolio, (ii) claims fraud, (iii) impacts from catastrophes, (iv) enterprise risk management capital scenarios, and (v) investment portfolio changes. We rely on these financial models to analyze historical loss costs and pricing, trends in claims severity and frequency, the occurrence of catastrophe losses, determining reinsurance attachment and exhaustion points, investment performance, portfolio risk, and our economic capital position. Flaws in these financial models, or in the assumptions made in them, could lead to increased losses. We believe that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method for monitoring and controlling risk, and are tools that do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management.\nRisks Related to Our Investments Segment\nOur investments are exposed to credit risk, interest rate fluctuation, and changes in value.\nWe depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenue and earnings. Our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations, or other factors. The value of our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk from the issuers, and/or guarantors and insurers, of the securities we hold, and other counterparties in certain transactions. Defaults on any of our investments by any issuer, guarantor, insurer, or other counterparty could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains - or result in investment losses. We are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities we own may default on principal and interest payment obligations. Additionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to the market price, and cash flow variability, associated with changes in interest rates.\nAs a result of these items, the value and liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Future fluctuations in the value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nSignificant future declines in investment value also could require further OTTI charges. For more information regarding market interest rate, credit, and equity price risk, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe have securities tied to LIBOR, which is being eliminated by the end of 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 19% of our fixed income securities portfolio was comprised of investment securities that have a non-fixed rate. Included in this 19% is a 12% allocation to floating rate securities that are primarily tied to the U.S. dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), which will be eliminated by the end of 2021. LIBOR is used to calculate interest rates for numerous types of debt obligations, including personal and commercial loans, interest rate swaps,\nand other derivative products, making it a primary metric in the global banking system. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") determined that LIBOR should no longer be used as a benchmark rate. In anticipation of the elimination of LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Reserve established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") to select a replacement index for U.S. Dollar LIBOR. ARRC, comprised of a group of large domestic banks and regulators, voted to use a benchmark, known as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is based on short-term loans backed by Treasury securities, known as repurchase agreements or \"repo\" trades. ARRC announced a paced transition plan for this new rate, including specific steps and timelines designed to encourage adoption of SOFR. We are unclear whether the elimination of LIBOR and the transition to SOFR will have any material impact on the performance of our floating rate investments.\nWe are subject to the types of risks inherent in investing in private limited partnerships.\nOur other investments include investments in private limited partnerships that invest in various strategies, such as private equity, private credit, and real assets. As the primary assets and liabilities underlying the investments in these limited partnerships generally do not have quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets, the valuation of our interests in these limited partnerships is subject to a higher level of subjectivity and unobservable inputs than substantially all of our other investments. Because these limited partnership investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting, any valuation decreases could negatively impact our results of operations. We currently expect to increase our allocation to these investments, which may result in additional variability in our net investment income.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or our financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on our periodic evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments when the evaluations are made. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken as reflected in our Financial Statements. For further information about our evaluation and considerations for determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, please refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Evolving Laws, Regulation, and Public Policy Debates\nWe are subject to complex and changing laws, regulations, and public policy debates that expose us to regulatory scrutiny, potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business.\nOur operations are subject to complex and changing state and federal laws, regulations, and public policy debates on subjects, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nPricing and underwriting practices;\n\u2022\nClaims practices;\n\u2022\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves;\n\u2022\nExiting geographic markets and/or canceling or non-renewing policies;\n\u2022\nAssessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds, and other mandatory assigned risks and reinsurance;\n\u2022\nThe types, quality, and concentration of investments we make;\n\u2022\nMinimum capital requirements for the Insurance Subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nDividends from our Insurance Subsidiaries to the Parent;\n\u2022\nPrivacy and data security;\n\u2022\nTax;\n\u2022\nAntitrust;\n\u2022\nConsumer protection;\n\u2022\nAdvertising;\n\u2022\nSales;\n\u2022\nBilling and e-commerce;\n\u2022\nIntellectual property ownership and infringement;\n\u2022\nDigital platforms;\n\u2022\nInternet, telecommunications, and mobile communications;\n\u2022\nMedia and digital content;\n\u2022\nAvailability of third-party software applications and services;\n\u2022\nLabor and employment;\n\u2022\nAnti-money laundering; and\n\u2022\nEnvironmental, health, and safety.\nWe continue to monitor and be actively involved in the industry and public policy discussions around changes in legislation and regulation on these issues. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect our business by increasing our costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers.\nIf Congress were to enact a law that directly regulates insurance, particularly related to oversight of insurer solvency, and state regulators remained responsible for rate approval, it is possible that we could be subject to a conflicting and inconsistent regulatory framework that could impact our profitability and capital adequacy.\nIf the NAIC were to adopt a specific group capital adequacy standard, it is possible that minimum capital requirements for insurers could be increased and adversely impact our growth and return on equity.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we can provide no assurance that our employees, contractors, or independent distribution partners will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. To some degree, we have multiple regulators whose authority may overlap and may have different interpretations and/or regulations related to the same legal issues. This creates the risk that one regulator's position or interpretation may conflict with that of another regulator on the same issue. The cost of complying with various, potentially conflicting laws and regulations, and changes in those laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nInsurers are subject to intense regulatory, political, and media scrutiny. We are subject to government market conduct review and investigations, legal actions, and penalties. There can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of such examinations, investigations, or media scrutiny in the future. If we are found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business is subject to a variety of state, federal, and other laws, rules, policies, and other obligations regarding data protection.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). Federal laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the policies of the Federal Trade Commission. Several states, such as New York, Nevada, and California, have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or creating new rights concerning PII. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant reputational harm, penalties, and legal liability.\nWe make statements about our use and disclosure of PII through our privacy policy, information provided on our website, and other public statements. If we fail to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state, and international privacy-related and data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and others. Such proceedings could impact our reputation and result in penalties, including ongoing audit requirements, and significant legal liability.\nIncidental to our insurance operations, we are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings that, because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nWe are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that include:\n\u2022\nDefense of or indemnity for third-party suits brought against our insureds;\n\u2022\nDefense of actions brought against us by our insureds who disagree with our coverage decisions, some of which allege bad faith claims handling and seek extra-contractual damages, punitive damages, or other penalties;\n\u2022\nActions we file, primarily for declaratory judgment, seeking confirmation that we have made appropriate coverage decisions under our insurance contracts;\n\u2022\nActions brought against us or competitors alleging improper business practices and sometimes seeking class status. Such actions historically have included issues and allegations, without limitation, related to (i) unfairly discriminatory underwriting practices, including the impact of credit score usage, (ii) managed care practices, such as provider reimbursement, and (iii) automobile claims practices; and\n\u2022\nActions we file against third parties and other insurers for subrogation and recovery of other amounts we paid on behalf of our insureds.\nFrom time-to-time, legal proceedings in which we are involved may receive attention from media based on their perceived newsworthiness and/or relationship to a variety of broad economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends. Such media stories could negatively impact our reputation.\nWe expect that any potential ultimate liability for ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance business, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to our consolidated financial condition. Litigation outcomes, however, are inherently unpredictable even with meritorious defenses. The time a case is in litigation also is unpredictable, as state court dockets are increasingly overcrowded. Generally, the longer a case is in litigation the more expensive it can become. Because the amounts sought in certain of these actions are large or indeterminate, any adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Governance\nWe are a holding company and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders, pay indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions may be limited because our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated.\nRestrictions on the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or advances to the Parent, or enter into transactions with affiliates may materially affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repay our indebtedness.\nIn 2020, the Insurance Subsidiaries have the ability to provide the Parent with $267 million in ordinary annual dividends under applicable state regulation; but their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances is subject to the approval or review of their domiciliary state insurance regulators. For additional details regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 20. \u201cStatutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" of this Form 10-K.\nThe Parent\u2019s ability to pay dividends to shareholders is also impacted by covenants in its credit agreement (the \u201cLine of Credit\u201d) among the Parent, the lenders named therein (the \u201cLenders\u201d), and the Bank of Montreal, Chicago Branch, as Administrative Agent, that obligate it to, among other things, maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. For additional details about the Line of Credit\u2019s financial covenants, see Note 10. \u201cIndebtedness\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nBecause we are a New Jersey corporation and an insurance holding company, we may be less attractive to potential acquirers and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe are a New Jersey company and provisions of the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may discourage, delay, or prevent us from being acquired. A supermajority of our shareholders must approve (i) certain business combinations with interested shareholders, or (ii) any amendment to the related provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless certain conditions are met. These conditions may relate to, among other things, the interested stockholder\u2019s acquisition of stock, the approval of the business combination by disinterested members of our Board and disinterested stockholders, and the price and payment of the consideration proposed in the business combination. In addition to considering the effects of any action on our shareholders (including any offer or proposal to acquire the Parent) , our Board may consider, in determining the best interests of the Parent: (i) the long-term, as well as the short-term, interests of the Parent and our shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may best be served by the continued independence of the Parent; (ii) the effects of the action on the Parent's employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers; and (iii) the effects of the action on the community in which the Parent operates.\nThese provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and New Jersey law could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over our common stock\u2019s prevailing market price in the event of a hostile takeover and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nBecause we own insurance subsidiaries, any party seeking to acquire 10% or more of our stock must seek prior approval from the domiciliary insurance regulators of the subsidiaries and file extensive information regarding their business operations and finances.\nRisks Related to Our General Operations\nWe are subject to attempted cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity risks.\nOur business heavily relies on information technology and application systems that may be accessed from, or are connected to, the Internet. As a result, we may be impacted by a malicious cyber-attack. Our systems also contain proprietary and confidential information, including PII, about our operations, employees, agents, and customers and their employees and\nproperty. A malicious cyber-attack on (i) our systems, (ii) our distribution partners or their key operating systems, and (iii) any other of our third-party partners or vendors and their key operating systems may interrupt our ability to operate and impact our results of operations.\nWe have implemented systems and processes intended to mitigate or secure, through encryption and authentication technologies, our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to, or loss of, sensitive data. Our security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities, as cyber-attacks are continuing to evolve daily. We may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management, or other irregularities. Any disruption or breach of our systems or data security could damage our reputation and result in monetary damages that are difficult to quantify, but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. To mitigate this risk, we have and expect to continue to (i) conduct employee education programs and tabletop exercises, and (ii) develop and invest in a variety of controls to prevent, detect, and appropriately react to cyber-attacks, including frequently testing our systems' security and access controls. We have insurance coverage for certain cybersecurity risks, including privacy breach incidents, that provides coverage up to $20 million above a $1 million deductible. Such coverage may be insufficient to indemnify all losses or types of claims that may arise.\nOur long-term strategy to deploy operational leverage is dependent on the success of our risk management strategies, and their failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an insurer, we assume risk from our customers. Our long-term strategy includes the use of above average operational leverage, which can be measured as the ratio of NPW to our equity or policyholders' surplus. We balance operational leverage risk with a number of risk management strategies within our insurance operations to achieve a balance of growth and profit, including purchasing significant amounts of reinsurance, a disciplined approach to reserving and a conservative investment philosophy, and to help mitigate our exposure to this risk. These strategies have inherent limitations. We cannot be certain that an event or series of unanticipated events will not occur and result in losses greater than we expect and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.", "PERMNO": 68292, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "SIGI"}
