You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our common stock and growth prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nRisks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a limited operating history, have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have had only one product candidate in clinical trials and no commercial sales, which, together with our limited operating history, make it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of non-absorbed polymeric drugs to treat disorders in the areas of renal, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases with a limited operating history. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused principally on developing our lead product candidate, Patiromer for Oral Suspension, or Patiromer FOS, which is our only product to have reached clinical development. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in August 2007. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $79.9 million, $73.8 million and $43.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $305.7 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next two years as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize, Patiromer FOS. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to the nonclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidate, Patiromer FOS. As of January 31, 2015, we had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $174.5 million. Subsequently, we completed an at-the-market offering of our common stock in February 2015 and an underwritten public offering of our common stock in March 2015 pursuant to which we received additional net proceeds of approximately $170.2 million. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future as we continue development, seek regulatory approval, and prepare for the commercialization of, Patiromer FOS and develop any other product candidates we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and supply, preparing for commercial launch and sales and marketing. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any clinical trial and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development, regulatory approval process and commercialization of Patiromer FOS and any future product candidates. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for Patiromer FOS and the costs of post-marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe findings of the FDA during their routine inspections of our facilities and the facilities of our contract manufacturers and clinical trial sites during the NDA review process and our ability to promptly and adequately address any such findings;\n\u2022\nthe costs of obtaining commercial supplies of Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing, selling and marketing costs associated with Patiromer FOS, including the cost and timing of expanding our sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe amount of sales and other revenues from Patiromer FOS, if approved, including the sales price and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to draw down up to $20.0 million in the second tranche of our term loans pursuant to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement we entered into with our existing lenders in May 2014, which will be available to us beginning on July 1, 2015 and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2015 and (ii) an event of default under the agreement;\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner for potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate:\n\u2022\nclinical trials or other development activities for Patiromer FOS or any future product candidate;\n\u2022\nour research and development activities; or\n\u2022\nour establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize Patiromer FOS or any future product candidate.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, Patiromer FOS.\nTo date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the research, development and potential commercialization of Patiromer FOS, which is currently our lead product candidate and only product candidate to reach clinical trials. Our near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our operations and generate revenue, will depend heavily on FDA approval of Patiromer FOS and its commercial success. The commercial success of Patiromer FOS will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe timely review and approval of our NDA for Patiromer FOS by the FDA;\n\u2022\nwhether we are required by the FDA to conduct additional clinical trials prior to any approval to market Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects of Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify, recruit, hire, train, incentivize and retain a commercial and medical affairs organization, including sales representatives, with appropriate technical expertise;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture quantities of Patiromer FOS using commercially sufficient processes and at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and enable us to reduce our cost of manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to continue to develop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs;\n\u2022\nour ability to ensure that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers Patiromer FOS to meet anticipated demand in both inpatient and outpatient prescribing settings;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively execute our plans for potential commercial launch, including, for example, raising awareness regarding the need for hyperkalemia management and the benefits, administration and use of Patiromer FOS, ensuring acceptance of Patiromer FOS as safe and effective by the medical community as well as government and commercial payers, ensuring adoption of Patiromer FOS by target physicians, ensuring healthcare professionals and patients have timely access to Patiromer FOS, ensuring affordability of Patiromer FOS for patients, and developing effective education and support programs to enable patient initiation and adherence;\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nreceiving a product label that allows for the successful promotion of Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\naccess to a sufficient number of target physicians to prescribe Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and sustain an adequate level of formulary coverage for Patiromer FOS by government and commercial payers;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our own or any future strategic collaborators\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference or patent infringement claims; and\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile of Patiromer FOS following any regulatory approval.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will ever be able to generate revenue through the sale of Patiromer FOS. If we are not successful in commercializing Patiromer FOS, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for Patiromer FOS under applicable regulatory requirements.\nTo gain approval to market a drug product, we must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that adequately demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the product for the intended indication applied for in the NDA or other respective regulatory filing. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in, or following, clinical trials even after promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical studies. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct.\nOur business currently depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our lead product candidate, Patiromer FOS. Based on the results of our eight clinical trials, including our Phase 2b and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, we submitted our NDA to the FDA in October 2014 seeking marketing approval for the use of Patiromer FOS for the treatment of hyperkalemia and the FDA accepted our NDA for filing in December 2014.\nHowever, Patiromer FOS may not receive marketing approval despite having achieved its specified endpoints in clinical trials. Although the design of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial was agreed to under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, with the FDA, the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in evaluating the results of this trial and our earlier trials. For example, notwithstanding our view to the contrary, the FDA may determine that the efficacy data and/or safety data from our Phase 2b and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials do not support approval of our NDA for Patiromer FOS. Clinical data often is susceptible to varying interpretations and many companies that have believed that their products performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval for their products. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Upon the FDA\u2019s review of the data in our NDA, it may request that we conduct additional analyses and, if it believes that such data are not satisfactory, could advise us that Patiromer FOS is not approvable with the filed data package.\nBased on these factors, the FDA may request additional information from us, including data from additional clinical and/or non-clinical trials, and, ultimately, may not grant marketing approval for Patiromer FOS.\nThe denial or delay of regulatory approval for Patiromer FOS would prevent or delay commercialization of Patiromer FOS and adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.\nIf we do not receive approval of our NDA or foreign marketing authorization for Patiromer FOS, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed and we may need to curtail or cease operations. We currently have no drug products approved for sale, and we may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize Patiromer FOS. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market Patiromer FOS in the U.S. until we receive approval of our NDA from the FDA.\nThe FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval to market Patiromer FOS for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that Patiromer FOS is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with the interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of Patiromer FOS outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirement for additional nonclinical or clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s non-approval of the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s failure to approve our processes/systems at our corporate facility, or the manufacturing processes or third-party manufacturers with which we contract, which will also be inspected by the FDA in connection with the review of our NDA; or\n\u2022\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized.\nEven if we receive approval of our NDA or foreign marketing authorization for Patiromer FOS, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials which may be required after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may also approve Patiromer FOS for a more limited indication and/or a narrower patient population than we originally request, and the FDA, or applicable foreign regulatory agency, may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of Patiromer FOS. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of Patiromer FOS and would have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects.\nWe currently have limited commercial and medical affairs capabilities and no sales capabilities. If we are unable to build these capabilities on our own or through third parties, we will not be able to successfully commercialize Patiromer FOS, if approved, or any future product candidates or generate product revenue.\nWe currently have limited commercial and medical affairs capabilities and no sales capabilities, and we have no experience commercializing a pharmaceutical product. Our ability to build effective commercial, medical affairs, marketing, sales, market access, managerial and other non-technical capabilities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify, recruit, hire, train, incentivize and retain a significant number of commercial and medical affairs personnel, including a specialty sales force with appropriate technical expertise;\n\u2022\ntrain our sales representatives, who will have no prior experience with our company or Patiromer FOS, to deliver clear and compelling messages regarding Patiromer FOS and to be credible and persuasive in educating physicians on the appropriate situations to consider prescribing it;\n\u2022\nensure our commercial customer-facing team, including sales, market access, and field logistics professionals, effectively build relationships with their respective customers;\n\u2022\nmanage a geographically dispersed national commercial customer-facing organization; and\n\u2022\nmanage our significant projected growth and the integration of new personnel.\nBuilding our commercial and medical affairs capabilities may be more expensive and time consuming than we anticipate, requiring us to divert resources from other intended purposes or preventing us from building these capabilities to the desired levels. Any failure or delay in building these capabilities will adversely impact the successful commercialization of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidate.\nIn addition, given our lack of prior experience in marketing, selling and distributing pharmaceutical products, our initial specialty sales force may be materially less than the actual number of sales representatives required to successfully commercialize Patiromer FOS. As such, we may be required to hire substantially more sales representatives to adequately support the commercialization of Patiromer FOS. We may choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to\nenter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Patiromer FOS, and any such arrangements may result in lower product revenue than if we directly sold and distributed Patiromer FOS and some or all of the product revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, and these efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to build our commercial and medical affairs capabilities, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, we may be unable to successfully commercialize Patiromer FOS or any future product candidate, and our revenue will suffer and we will incur significant additional losses.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of nonclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in clinical studies for Patiromer FOS do not ensure that future clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. As part of our NDA for Patiromer FOS, we requested a partial waiver and deferral for submission of pediatric data until after approval of Patiromer FOS for use in adults.\nWe do not know whether future clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory approval to commence a trial, if applicable;\n\u2022\nreach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u2022\nrecruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\nhave patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nensure that clinical sites observe trial protocol or continue to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\naddress any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022\naddress any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022\ninitiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u2022\nmanufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we have historically done, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of physicians or enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocols as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries. In addition, the FDA may determine that our clinical trial results obtained in foreign subjects do not represent the safety and efficacy of Patiromer FOS when administered in US patients and are thus not supportive of our NDA approval in the US.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some of our nonclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials and, in some cases, nonclinical studies. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, collaborative partners and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct clinical trials on our drug candidates. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct some of our nonclinical studies and all of our clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, including some regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or cGCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials.\nIn addition, the execution of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. Moreover, these third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. These third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon as little as 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. Some of these agreements may also be terminated by such third parties under certain other circumstances, including our insolvency. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nWe rely completely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our clinical drug supply of Patiromer FOS, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supply of Patiromer FOS and nonclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidate.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or internal capability to produce our commercial supply of Patiromer FOS and we lack the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any product candidates on a nonclinical, clinical or commercial scale. The FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies must, pursuant to inspections that will be conducted now that our NDA has been accepted for filing or after we submit relevant foreign regulatory applications, approve our contract manufacturers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product for Patiromer FOS, or any future product candidates.\nWe do not directly control the manufacturing of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with the cGMP for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Furthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the\nregulatory clearance of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facility. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe and our third-party suppliers continue to refine and improve the manufacturing process, certain aspects of which are complex and unique, and we may encounter difficulties with new or existing processes, particularly as we seek to significantly increase our capacity to commercialize Patiromer FOS. For example, we have analyzed the impurities identified in the manufactured registration batches of Patiromer FOS and we believe the levels of impurities, including the levels of genotoxic and special toxicological concern impurities, are below the suggested guidance recommendations; however, toxicological assessments might change based on our future findings. Our reliance on contract manufacturers also exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may appropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nOur current drug substance is acquired from only two suppliers and our finished drug product is acquired from a single-source supplier. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us with the drug substance or the finished drug product, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe currently operate under a multi-year Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Lanxess Corporation, or Lanxess, and a multi-year Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with DPx Fine Chemicals Austria GmbH & Co KG, or DPx Fine Chemicals, formerly DSM Fine Chemicals Austria NFG GMBH & Co. KG, for the manufacture and supply of drug substance. However, we do not currently have additional suppliers of drug substance under contract, and we have submitted only Lanxess as a drug substance supplier with our NDA for Patiromer FOS. We currently operate under a multi-year Supply Agreement with Patheon Inc., or Patheon, for the manufacture and supply of finished drug product. However, we do not have an alternative supplier of finished drug product under contract, and we have submitted only Patheon as a finished drug product supplier with our NDA for Patiromer FOS. Although we have entered into long-term commercial supply agreements with Lanxess, DPx Fine Chemicals and Patheon, we may be unable do so with alternative suppliers and manufacturers or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse impact upon our business.\nIn addition, we currently rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce Patiromer FOS, including all of the starting/raw materials and excipient, such as methyl-2-fluoro-acrylate monomer, or MFA. We do not have direct control over the acquisition of those materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, outside of our drug substance suppliers, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of those materials.\nWe are dependent on the approval of additional drug substance and drug product suppliers to ensure sufficient supply to meet our anticipated market demand and to reduce the manufacturing cost of Patiromer FOS. Our inability to obtain approval for additional suppliers and/or the inability of our suppliers to achieve larger scale production, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nPolymeric-based drugs like Patiromer FOS generally require large quantities of drug substance, as compared to small molecule drugs. Thus, we will require larger scale and/or multiple suppliers of drug substance and drug product in order to produce sufficient quantities of Patiromer FOS to meet our anticipated market demand. Our current suppliers of drug substance, Lanxess and DPx Fine Chemicals, do not currently have the capacity to manufacture Patiromer FOS in the quantities that we believe will be sufficient to meet anticipated market demand. Our business plan assumes that we are able to develop a supply chain with multiple suppliers and significantly decrease our cost of goods within the first several years of commercialization of Patiromer FOS, enabling us to achieve gross margins similar to those achieved by other companies that produce non-absorbed polymeric drugs. If we are unable to reduce the manufacturing cost of Patiromer FOS, our operating results will suffer and our ability to achieve profitability will be significantly jeopardized.\nBecause we submitted our NDA with single source suppliers for drug substance and drug product, we will need to obtain approval from the FDA for these additional suppliers, including approval for the testing necessary to prove equivalence of drug substance and product produced by the additional suppliers. Further, we are dependent on our drug substance and product suppliers to be able to fully scale up the production of Patiromer FOS as well as validate certain process improvements in order to reach the quantities we anticipate needing.\nWe are also dependent upon the appropriate sourcing of starting/raw material, including large quantities, measured in metric tons, of MFA. While we believe there are multiple alternative suppliers of MFA, we will need our drug substance suppliers to qualify these alternate MFA suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the starting materials necessary to produce Patiromer FOS. If our drug substance manufacturer is unable to source, or we are unable to purchase, MFA on acceptable terms, of sufficient quality, and in adequate quantities, if at all, the ability of Patiromer FOS to reach its market potential, or any future product candidates to be launched would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates.\nIf there is a disruption to our contract manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 relevant operations, we will have no other means of producing Patiromer FOS until they restore the affected facilities or we or they procure alternative manufacturing facilities. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our contract manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture Patiromer FOS on a timely basis.\nIf we fail to establish an effective distribution process utilizing cold chain logistics for Patiromer FOS, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products to patients. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse these products and distribute them to pharmacies and wholesale distributors who will supply Patiromer FOS to the market. We will require that Patiromer FOS be maintained at a controlled refrigerated temperature throughout the distribution chain. This distribution chain will require significant coordination among our manufacturing, supply-chain and finance teams, as well as commercial departments, including market access, sales, and marketing. In addition, failure to secure contracts with appropriate pharmacy providers and/or wholesale distributors could negatively impact the distribution of Patiromer FOS, and failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of Patiromer FOS will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, the use of cold chain logistics and a distribution network for Patiromer FOS involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that distributors or pharmacies may:\n\u2022\nnot effectively manage inventory creating delays in product fulfillment to patients or hospitals and/or inventory loss;\n\u2022\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using Patiromer FOS, or any product related complaints;\n\u2022\nnot effectively sell or support Patiromer FOS with sufficient cold storage or accordance with class of trade rules;\n\u2022\nreduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell Patiromer FOS in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nPatiromer FOS has a limited room temperature shelf life, and if we do not effectively maintain our cold chain supply logistics, then we may experience an unusual number of product returns or out of date product. Any such failure may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our business.\nEven if Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success, which will depend, in part, upon the degree of acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payers and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals, Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians and patients, and may not be commercially successful. Patiromer FOS may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payers and the medical community. Market acceptance of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects and overall safety profile of the product;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u2022\nadvantages over existing therapies, such as, in the case of Patiromer FOS, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (e.g., Kayexalate\u00ae) and competitive products that may receive regulatory approval in the future;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective chronic daily treatment;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration of our products;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over current treatment options or alternative treatments, including future alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for our products, if approved, on the part of payers and patients;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe availability of products and their ability to meet market demand, including a reliable supply for long-term daily treatment;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our marketing and distribution organizations; and\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nAny failure by our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our results of operations.\nPatiromer FOS, if approved, may face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\nThe pharmaceutical market is highly competitive and dynamic, and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. We are seeking regulatory approval of Patiromer FOS for the treatment of hyperkalemia. While current options for the chronic management of hyperkalemia are limited, we expect to compete against well-known treatment options, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate (e.g., Kayexalate\u00ae). In addition, ZS Pharma, Inc., or ZS Pharma, is developing a zirconium silicate particle to treat hyperkalemia referred to as ZS-9, which recently completed a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. ZS Pharma has announced that it intends to submit a NDA for ZS-9 to the FDA in the first half of 2015. In order to compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia with Patiromer FOS is worthwhile and is a superior alternative to existing or new therapies for hyperkalemia.\nWe face significant competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address these markets. Many of our competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in nonclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.\nFailure to effectively compete against established treatment options for hyperkalemia or in the future with new products currently in development would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of payer formulary access and/or reimbursement for our products, sales would be adversely affected.\nWe expect patients who have hyperkalemia to need treatment with Patiromer FOS throughout their lifetimes, but anticipate that most patients will not be capable of paying for the entire cost of treatment themselves. There will be no commercially viable market for Patiromer FOS without formulary access and reimbursement from third-party government and commercial payers. Additionally, even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of access and/or reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nObtaining formulary approval can be an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell Patiromer FOS or any future products into our target markets. Even if we do obtain formulary approval, third-party payers, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. A current trend in the U.S. health care industry is toward cost containment. Large government and commercial payers and pharmacy benefits managers are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of and access to particular treatments. Such third-party payers, including Medicare, are questioning the coverage of, and challenging the prices charged for medical products, and many third-party payers limit coverage of, or reimbursement for, newly approved health care products.\nCost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. If the prices for our products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis.\nOur clinical drug development program may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take Patiromer FOS may experience. The number of subjects exposed to Patiromer FOS treatment and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events, or chance findings, that may only be detected after Patiromer FOS is administered to more patients and for greater periods of time.\nClinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. However, with a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, we cannot be fully assured that rare and severe side effects of Patiromer FOS may not be uncovered after a significantly larger number of patients are exposed to the drug. Further, we have not designed our clinical trials to determine the effect and safety consequences on total body potassium levels of lowering serum potassium over a multi-year period or to measure the safety of immediate reductions in serum potassium.\nAlthough we have monitored the subjects in our studies for certain safety concerns and we have not seen evidence of significant safety concerns in our clinical trials, patients treated with Patiromer FOS, if approved, may experience adverse reactions. For example, we have seen some reductions in blood pressure in some of our clinical trials, which can lead to hypotension, and some reductions in serum magnesium in some patients in our clinical trials, which can lead to weakness, muscle cramps, cardiac arrhythmia, increased irritability of the nervous system with tremors and jerking, confusion or seizures.\nAlthough we have not seen any evidence of these reductions causing a safety concern in our clinical programs, it is possible that the FDA may ask for additional data regarding such matters. Further, a degradant of Patiromer FOS is calcium fluoride, which may lead to increased levels of fluoride in patients who take Patiromer FOS. Although none of the symptoms associated with acute fluoride toxicity have been reported in Patiromer FOS clinical studies, patients may experience this side effect. If safety problems occur or are identified after Patiromer FOS reaches the market, the FDA may require that we amend the labeling of Patiromer FOS, recall Patiromer FOS, or even withdraw approval for Patiromer FOS.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations, product recalls or withdrawals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Patiromer FOS or any future products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering use in our clinical trials in the amount of $5.0 million for each occurrence and $5.0 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If and when we obtain approval for marketing Patiromer FOS, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of Patiromer FOS. However, we may be unable to obtain this liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe will need to significantly increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in achieving and managing our projected growth.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 115 full-time employees. We will need to significantly increase the size of our organization, including our commercial personnel, in order to manage our operations, regulatory filings, manufacturing and supply activities, clinical trials and commercialization activities. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we:\n\u2022\nexpand our general and administrative and sales and marketing organizations;\n\u2022\nidentify, recruit, hire, train, incentivize, retain and integrate a significant number of additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to third parties; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur management, personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to achieve and manage our projected growth.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management, we may be unable to successfully develop Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent upon our experienced senior management. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our senior management team, these agreements do not provide for a fixed term of service.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. In addition, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses. We have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach; however, such measures cannot provide absolute security, and we have taken, and will take, additional security measures to protect against any future intrusion. Any failure to protect against breakdowns, malicious intrusions and computer viruses may result in the impairment of production and key business processes. In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees or others, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. Such disruptions and breaches of security could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our business.\nOur loan and security agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur loan and security agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions without our lenders\u2019 prior consent. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell, transfer, lease or dispose of our assets;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nencumber or permit liens on certain of our assets;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including paying dividends on, repurchasing or making distributions with respect to our common stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified investments (including loans and advances);\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nThe covenants in our loan and security agreements may limit our ability to take certain actions and, in the event that we breach one or more covenants, our lenders may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts outstanding, plus penalties and interest, terminate their commitments to extend further credit and foreclose on the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Such repayment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. We may fail to comply with the rules that apply to public companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could result in sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel must devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we maintain compliance with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. Any changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms.\nIn addition, we expect that we will need to implement an enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system for our company. An ERP system is intended to combine and streamline the management of our financial, accounting, human resources, sales and marketing and other functions, enabling us to manage operations and track performance more effectively. However, an ERP system would likely require us to complete many processes and procedures for the effective use of the system or to run our business using the system, which may result in substantial costs. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using an ERP system could adversely affect our controls and harm our business, including our ability to forecast or make sales and collect our receivables. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, and the related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2014, Section 404 requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering of our common stock, or IPO (December 31, 2018), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than an aggregate of $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nDuring the course of our review and testing, we may identify deficiencies and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. Furthermore, if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, as a public company we are required to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The NASDAQ Global Select Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring or commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing, potential approval and commercialization of Patiromer FOS, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize a portfolio of products utilizing proprietary discovery and development technology. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and/or by selectively pursuing commercially synergistic in-licensing or acquisition of additional compounds. All of our other potential product candidates remain in the discovery stage. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payers, if applicable.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing Patiromer FOS.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize Patiromer FOS and potential future product candidates.\nWe may seek collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of Patiromer FOS and potential future product candidates. We may enter into these arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for our product candidates, both in the U.S. and internationally. We will face, to the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we so chose to enter into such arrangements. The terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nAny future collaborations that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority.\nCollaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.\nIf we engage in acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nAlthough we currently have no intent to do so, we may attempt to acquire businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. If we do undertake any acquisitions, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, products or product candidates into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from our core business. In addition, we may fail to retain key executives and employees of the companies we acquire, which may reduce the value of the acquisition or give rise to additional integration costs. Future acquisitions could result in additional issuances of equity securities that would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. Future acquisitions could also result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or the amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition.\nIf we seek and obtain approval to commercialize Patiromer FOS outside of the U.S., a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf Patiromer FOS is approved for commercialization outside the U.S., we may enter into agreements with third parties to market Patiromer FOS outside the U.S. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into these international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems, and different competitive drugs indicated to treat hyperkalemia;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product and product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters and other facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which in the past has experienced severe earthquakes. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor any future collaboration partner is permitted to market Patiromer FOS or any future product candidate in the U.S. until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA. Although our NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA, we have not obtained marketing approval for Patiromer FOS anywhere in the world. Obtaining regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other actions, including:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of regulatory approval of products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production; and\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a drug candidate in the U.S. or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. The number of nonclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our drug candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of a drug candidate for any or all targeted indications.\nUnder the policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as reauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012, the FDA reviews new drugs on two distinct timelines for standard review and priority review. For certain drugs subject to standard review, such as Patiromer FOS, the FDA has a goal to complete its review of the NDA and respond to the applicant within ten months from the 60 day filing date of an NDA. The FDA assigned a target action date of October 21, 2015 for the Patiromer FOS NDA. However, the review process and the PDUFA target action date may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the original NDA submission. The FDA\u2019s review goals are subject to change, and the duration of the FDA\u2019s review may depend on the number and type of other NDAs that are submitted with the FDA around the same time period.\nThe FDA may also refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an Advisory Committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In connection with the acceptance of our NDA for Patiromer FOS, the FDA has indicated it does not currently plan to convene an Advisory Committee for advice regarding our NDA; however, this decision is not guaranteed and the FDA may revisit its position upon further review of our NDA.\nAs part of its review of the NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities where the drug is manufactured to ensure compliance with cGMPs. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the Sponsor to assure compliance with GCPs before approving an NDA based on clinical data. Depending on the outcome of any FDA inspections and the FDA\u2019s findings, we may receive, and be required to respond to, observations contained in an FDA Form 483 issued by the FDA setting forth conditions observed which the investigator believes constitute deviations from applicable law or regulations. Depending on the results of the FDA\u2019s evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for a specified indication, or a Complete Response Letter, containing the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. These conditions may include deficiencies identified in connection with the FDA\u2019s evaluation of the NDA submission or the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities. Until any such conditions or deficiencies have been resolved, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA.\nRegulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process and we may encounter matters with the FDA that requires us to expend additional time and resources and delay or prevent the approval of our product candidates. For example, the FDA may require us to conduct additional studies or trials for Patiromer FOS either prior to or post-approval, such as additional drug-drug interaction studies or safety or efficacy studies or trials, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program such as the number of subjects in our current clinical trials from the U.S. Further, there have been subject deaths in our clinical programs. While the incidence of subject deaths are not unexpected in view of the morbidity and mortality for the patient populations in our trials and have been determined by the study investigators and by us as unrelated to Patiromer FOS, the FDA may require us to perform additional studies or otherwise delay regulatory approval of Patiromer FOS. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na drug candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not find the data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA might not approve our third party manufacturers\u2019 processes or facilities; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf Patiromer FOS or any future product candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed. Additionally, if the FDA requires that we conduct additional clinical studies, places limitations on Patiromer FOS in our label, delays approval to market Patiromer FOS or limits the use of Patiromer FOS, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nAlthough we have entered into an SPA agreement with the FDA relating to our pivotal Phase 3 trial of Patiromer FOS, this agreement does not guarantee any particular outcome with respect to regulatory review of the pivotal trial or with respect to regulatory approval of Patiromer FOS.\nThe protocol for our pivotal Phase 3 trial of Patiromer FOS was reviewed and agreed upon by the FDA under an SPA, which allows for FDA evaluation of whether a clinical trial protocol could form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in support of an NDA. The SPA is an agreement that a Phase 3 trial\u2019s design, clinical endpoints, patient population and statistical analyses are sufficient to support the efficacy claim. Agreement on an SPA is not a guarantee of approval, and there is no assurance that the design of, or data collected from, the trial will be adequate to obtain the requisite regulatory approval. The SPA is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns unrecognized at the time the SPA was entered into become evident or other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise. In addition, upon written agreement of both parties, the SPA may be changed. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA and any resulting trial data in determining whether a drug is safe and effective and whether it will be approved. As a result, we do not know how the FDA will interpret the parties\u2019 respective commitments under the SPA, how it will interpret the data and results from the pivotal Phase 3 trial, whether the FDA will require that we conduct or complete one or more additional clinical trials to support potential approval, or whether Patiromer FOS will receive any regulatory approvals.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, any product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nEven if a drug is FDA-approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays or increased costs to assure compliance. If Patiromer FOS is approved it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the U.S. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have FDA approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues from Patiromer FOS. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate revenues from the sale of Patiromer FOS our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nCurrently we are seeking regulatory approval to market Patiromer FOS solely for the treatment of hyperkalemia and, unless we seek regulatory approval for additional indications, we will be prohibited from marketing Patiromer FOS for any other indication.\nWe are seeking approval to market Patiromer FOS for the treatment of hyperkalemia. We do not have plans to seek approval of Patiromer FOS for any other indication at this time. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market Patiromer FOS with an indication statement for the treatment of hyperkalemia, we will likely be prohibited from marketing Patiromer FOS using any promotional claims relating to maintaining more patients on, or enabling the increased or optimized usage of, RAAS inhibitors. The exploratory endpoints analyzing the modification of RAAS inhibitor medication due to recurrent hyperkalemia in the pivotal Phase 3 trial will not be sufficient to support FDA approval of a RAAS inhibitor enabling indication. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. While Patiromer FOS has been studied in the setting of hyperkalemia associated with the use of RAAS inhibitors, Patiromer FOS may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in its approved labeling. Under applicable regulations, the ability of a company to make marketing statements about the effectiveness of its drug outside of the statements made in the label, referred to as \u201coff-label\u201d marketing, is prohibited. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability.\nIf we fail to comply or are found to have failed to comply with FDA and other regulations related to the promotion of Patiromer FOS before it is approved or for unapproved uses, we could be subject to criminal penalties, substantial fines or other sanctions and damage awards.\nThe regulations relating to the promotion of products before approval or for unapproved uses are complex and subject to substantial interpretation by the FDA and other government agencies. We may not promote Patiromer FOS before we receive marketing approval from the FDA. Even if we receive marketing approval for Patiromer FOS, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. We intend to implement compliance and training programs designed to ensure that our sales and marketing practices comply with applicable regulations. Notwithstanding these programs, the FDA or other government agencies may allege or find that our practices constitute prohibited promotion of Patiromer FOS for unapproved uses. We also cannot be sure that our employees will comply with company policies and applicable regulations regarding the promotion of products before approval or for unapproved uses. Over the past several years, a significant number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including the Department of Justice and various U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have alleged violations of various federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products before approval or for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. Many of these investigations originate as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions under the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, any individual can bring a claim on behalf of the government alleging that a person or entity has presented a false claim, or caused a false claim to be submitted, to the government for payment. The person bringing a qui tam suit is entitled to a share of any recovery or settlement. Qui tam suits, also commonly referred to as \u201cwhistleblower suits,\u201d are often brought by current or former employees. In a qui tam suit, the government must decide whether to intervene and prosecute the case. If it declines, the individual may pursue the case alone.\nIf the FDA or any other governmental agency initiates an enforcement action against us or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such fines, awards or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects and reputation.\nIf approved, Patiromer FOS or any future products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory agencies and if we fail to do so we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nSome participants in our clinical studies have reported adverse effects after being treated with Patiromer FOS. If we are successful in commercializing Patiromer FOS or any other products, FDA and foreign regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe.\nWe may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency could take action, including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nIf third-party manufacturers fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBefore they can begin commercial manufacture of Patiromer FOS, contract manufacturers must obtain regulatory approval of their manufacturing facilities, processes and quality systems. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner.\nIf a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, Patiromer FOS may not be approved, or we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWe are currently only seeking regulatory approval to market Patiromer FOS in the U.S., and if we want to expand the geographies in which we may market Patiromer FOS, we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals.\nWe are seeking regulatory approval for Patiromer FOS in the U.S. for the treatment of hyperkalemia. In the future, we may attempt to develop and seek regulatory approval to promote and commercialize Patiromer FOS outside of the U.S. For example, we plan to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for Patiromer FOS in late 2015 or early 2016. In order to obtain approvals outside of the U.S., we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or studies to support our applications, which would be time consuming and expensive, and may produce results that do not result in regulatory approvals. Further, we will have to expend substantial time and resources in order to establish the commercial infrastructure or pursue a collaboration arrangement that would be necessary to promote and commercialize Patiromer FOS outside of the U.S. If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for Patiromer FOS in foreign jurisdictions, our ability to expand our business outside the U.S. will be severely limited.\nOur failure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions for Patiromer FOS would prevent us from marketing our products internationally.\nIn order to market any product in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, separate regulatory approvals are required. In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a MAA. Before granting the MAA, the EMA, or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nThe approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or to do so on a timely basis, and even if we do file we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nWe may be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nAlthough we do not currently have any products on the market, once we begin commercializing our products, we may be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate as a commercial organization include:\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; and\n\u2022\nU.S. and European reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and adversely impact our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and\ntheir provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nThe PPACA also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on drug manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. In addition, drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers were required to begin data collection on August 1, 2013 and report such data to the government by March 31, 2014 and by the 90th calendar day of each year thereafter.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the U.S. may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u2022\nadditional clinical trials to be conducted prior to obtaining approval;\n\u2022\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022\nrecall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u2022\nadditional record keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may become subject to claims alleging infringement of third parties\u2019 patents or proprietary rights and/or claims seeking to invalidate our patents, which would be costly, time consuming and, if successfully asserted against us, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates.\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings asserting patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We cannot be certain that Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates will not infringe existing or future third-party patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that we may infringe by commercializing Patiromer FOS or future product candidates. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. In addition, Patiromer FOS has a complex structure that makes it difficult to conduct a thorough search and review of all potentially relevant third-party patents. We may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of Patiromer FOS.\nWe may be subject to third-party claims in the future against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents. We may be required to indemnify future collaborators against such claims. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to redesign it, or to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, such litigation can be expensive and time consuming to litigate and would divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology similar or identical to ours, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, to determine which party is entitled to a patent on the disputed invention. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. Since patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates.\nIf our intellectual property related to Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates is not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to Patiromer FOS and our development programs. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, patents granted by the European Patent Office may be opposed by any person within nine months from the publication of the grant. Similar proceedings are available in other jurisdictions, and in some jurisdictions third parties can raise questions of validity with a patent office even before a patent has granted. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. For example, a third party may develop a competitive product that provides therapeutic benefits similar to Patiromer FOS but has a sufficiently different composition to fall outside the scope of our patent protection. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates is successfully challenged, then our ability to commercialize Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates could be negatively affected, and we may face unexpected competition that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market Patiromer FOS or any future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced.\nEven where laws provide protection, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. If we or one of our future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering Patiromer FOS or one of our future products, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability against our intellectual property related to Patiromer FOS, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on Patiromer FOS. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. Moreover, our competitors could counterclaim that we infringe their intellectual property, and some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios than we do.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable, processes for which patents may be difficult to obtain and/or enforce and any other elements of our product development processes that\ninvolve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and endeavor to execute confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our agreements will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the U.S. and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our IP License and Assignment Agreement, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to an IP License and Assignment Agreement with Ilypsa, Inc., or Ilypsa, which is a subsidiary of Amgen Inc., pursuant to which we license key intellectual property relating to our drug discovery and development technology. Although our obligations under the license are limited, the license agreement does impose certain diligence, notice and other obligations not currently applicable to us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, Ilypsa (Amgen) may have the right to terminate the license, other than in respect of Patiromer FOS.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the U.S. has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. Noncompliance with these requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe have not yet registered trademarks for a commercial trade name for Patiromer FOS in the U.S. or elsewhere and failure to secure such registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have not yet registered trademarks for a commercial trade name for Patiromer FOS in the U.S. or elsewhere. Our trademarks have been approved for registration in the U.S., but our trademark applications may be rejected during trademark registration proceedings outside the U.S. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties can oppose pending trademark applications and seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidates in the U.S. must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign\njurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market Patiromer FOS or any future products. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the U.S. and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our technology.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory approval or a complete response letter to Patiromer FOS, or specific label indications or patient populations for its use, or changes or delays in the regulatory review process;\n\u2022\nannouncements of therapeutic innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nchanges or developments in laws or regulations applicable to Patiromer FOS;\n\u2022\nfuture capital raising transactions;\n\u2022\nany adverse changes to our relationship with any manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe success of our testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe success of our efforts to acquire or license or discover additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical industry in general;\n\u2022\nachievement of expected product sales and profitability;\n\u2022\nmanufacture, supply or distribution shortages;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business, which could seriously harm our financial position. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock (December 31, 2018), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th and we have been a public company for at least one year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, including in future financings or similar arrangements. For example, we have issued approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock through registered offerings pursuant to our shelf-registration statement filed in December 2014. If we issue additional shares of our common stock, our stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nIf we do not achieve our publicly disclosed milestones or goals within the expected timing, our stockholders may lose confidence in our ability to achieve future success and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose information related to certain anticipated company milestones or goals and estimated timing for achieving them, including clinical, regulatory, commercial and partnering milestones or goals. However, we may fail to achieve these milestones or goals, or fail to do so within the expected timing or as projected by the analysts who follow us, and our stockholders and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our ability to achieve future success. As a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 45% of our outstanding voting stock. These stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that certain stockholders may believe are in their best interest.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the lapse of legal restrictions on resale, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Based upon the number of shares outstanding as of March 1, 2015, and after giving effect to our underwritten public offering of 4,485,000 shares in March 2015, we have outstanding a total of approximately 41.3 million shares of common stock. Of these shares, the shares of our common stock sold in our IPO, our public offering in April 2014, our at-the-market offering, and our public offering in March 2015 are currently freely tradable, without restriction (except as otherwise applicable), in the public market.\nThe lock-up agreements pertaining to our public offering in March 2015 will expire on or before May 26, 2015, following which up to 8.9 million additional shares of common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market, subject to any additional restrictions, all of which shares are held by current directors, executive officers and other affiliates and may be subject to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 5.4 million shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options, issuable upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans or subject to\noutstanding warrants are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could significantly reduce the value of our shares to a potential acquirer or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. The provisions in our charter documents include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote to remove a director for cause, and the prohibition on removal of directors without cause;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, these provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction. For a description of our capital stock, see the section titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d\nIn addition, certain provisions in our IP License and Assignment Agreement may discourage certain takeover or acquisition attempts, including that in the event we undergo a change of control, we shall pay to Ilypsa (Amgen) an increasing amount of the purchase price, less certain expenses, of such transaction, ranging from approximately 6.7% to 10% of such amount, up to a cap of $30.0 million.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nWe may be required to pay severance benefits to our employees who are terminated in connection with a change in control, which could harm our financial condition or results.\nEach of our executive officers is party to an employment agreement, and each of our other employees is party to an agreement or participates in a plan, that provides change in control severance benefits including cash payments for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock units in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control of us. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial condition and results. The accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock units could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our common stock. In addition, these potential severance benefits may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Additionally, the terms of our loan and security agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, our stockholders are not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders\u2019 ability to receive a return on their investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $240.1 million and $234.3 million for both U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and 2017 for California income tax purposes. If a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the corporation may be subject to annual limits on its ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. An ownership change is, as a general matter, triggered by sales or acquisitions of the corporation\u2019s stock in excess of 50 percentage points on a cumulative basis during a three-year period by persons owning 5% or more of the corporation\u2019s total equity value. We have performed an initial analysis under Section 382 of the Code and believe that we have in the past experienced ownership changes that will result in a limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of this analysis, we have removed the deferred tax assets for net operating losses of $28.6 million generated through December 31, 2014 from our deferred tax asset schedule and have recorded a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance. Our net operating loss carryforwards may also be subject to further limitations in the future as a result of additional ownership changes, including if we experience an ownership change as a result of our public offering in March 2015.", "PERMNO": 14321, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "RLYP"}
