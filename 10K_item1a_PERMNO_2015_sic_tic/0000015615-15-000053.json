If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to the Conclusion of the Independent Internal Investigation of the Audit Committee and Related Restatements of Our Financial Statements, Our Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting and Our Failure to Timely File Periodic Reports with the SEC.\nMatters relating to or arising from our Audit Committee investigation of certain accounting matters, including regulatory proceedings, litigation matters and potential additional expenses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Audit Committee has been undertaking an independent investigation primarily with respect to cost-to-complete estimates regarding certain projects within a service line in the Company\u2019s Electrical Transmission segment accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Utilizing a process established and observed by the Audit Committee, the Company undertook a detailed review of certain projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, as well as a detailed review of accounting judgments, estimates and entries over a multi-year period across the balance of the Company\u2019s segments selected to further test the reliability of the previously issued financial statements. The Company has concluded that certain accounting adjustments are appropriate with respect to interim periods during the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. The Company believes the appropriate accounting adjustments have been determined; however, the Audit Committee\u2019s independent investigation is ongoing and has not reached any findings or conclusions with respect to the underlying causes of these adjustments.\nAs a result, the Company\u2019s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014 should be restated. In this 2014 Form 10-K, we have provided restated financial statements for each of the affected 2014 interim periods and related disclosures in Note 2 - Independent Investigation of the Audit Committee and Related Restatements in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. The financial information that has been previously filed or otherwise reported for these periods is superseded by the information in this 2014 Form 10-K. We believe that presenting all of the amended and restated information regarding the 2014 interim periods in this 2014 Form 10-K allows investors to review all pertinent data in a single presentation. To date, we have incurred significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the investigation, the restatements and related matters, and may continue to incur significant additional expenses with regard to these matters and our remediation efforts. In addition, our CEO and CFO, as well as senior members of our finance and accounting departments, as well as senior management of our Electrical Transmission segment, have spent substantial amounts of time and effort with regard to the investigation and related accounting analyses, the restatements and related matters. The significant amount of time and effort spent by our management team on these matters has diverted, and is expected to continue to divert, their attention from the operation of our business. The expenses incurred, and expected to be incurred, on the investigation, the restatements and related matters and the diversion of the attention of the management team that has occurred, and is expected to continue, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.\nOur restatement of prior financial statements has exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. We have self-reported to the staff of the SEC (the \u201cStaff\u201d) regarding the Audit Committee\u2019s independent investigation and are cooperating with the Staff\u2019s requests for additional information regarding the investigation. We intend to continue full cooperation with the SEC. While we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in adjusting our consolidated financial statements, the SEC may disagree with our conclusions and adjustments. Accordingly, there is a risk that we may have to further restate our prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, we are subject to a federal securities purported class action related to the Audit Committee\u2019s investigation and there is a risk that additional such actions could be filed against us, our directors and officers. See \u201cWe are subject to a shareholder class action lawsuit, and this lawsuit and any future such lawsuits or investigations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\u201d below.\nIn March 2015, we received a New York Stock Exchange ( \u201cNYSE\u201d) letter, stating that as a result of the delayed filing of the Company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in the NYSE listed company manual and were therefore, subject to delisting from the NYSE. With the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, which we expect to file shortly after the filing of this 2014 Form 10-K, we believe that we will have remedied our non-compliance with the NYSE continued listing requirements.\nManagement has identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC rules require that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on management\u2019s assessment, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014. The specific material weakness is described in Part II - Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this 2014 Form 10-K in \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\u201d A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected. We cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. These misstatements could result in a further restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nWe have work remaining to remedy the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of developing and implementing our remediation plan for the identified material weakness, and we expect that this work will continue during the year ending December 31, 2015 and thereafter. There can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed, when it will be fully implemented and the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, we will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that our future financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. Until the remediation plan is complete and implemented, we will rely upon additional interim control procedures prescribed by management, including the use of manual mitigating control procedures and the utilization of external consultants, to help ensure that we fairly state our financial statements in all material respects. However, the establishment of these interim controls does not provide the same degree of assurance as a fully remediated control environment. For more information relating to our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, and the remediation plan undertaken by us, see Part II - Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this 2014 Form 10-K.\nOur failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital.\nWe did not file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 or our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 within the time frame required by SEC rules. Because of our failure to have timely filed our periodic reports with the SEC, we are currently ineligible to use SEC Form S-3, which is a short-form registration statement, to register our securities for public offer and sale, until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for a period of twelve months and any portion of a month from the due date of the last untimely report. Our inability to use Form S-3 limits our ability to access the public capital markets rapidly, including in reaction to changing business needs or market conditions. While we may currently register an offering of our securities on Form S-1 in a capital raising effort, whether to complete an acquisition or otherwise, doing so would likely increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete such acquisition in a timely manner.\nContinuing negative publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and related matters, the internal investigation conducted by the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the securities class action lawsuit, we have been the subject of negative publicity. This negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and may harm our reputation and our relationships with current and future investors, lenders, customers, suppliers and employees. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a shareholder class action lawsuit, and this lawsuit and any future such lawsuits or investigations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and certain of our executive officers are defendants in a federal securities class action lawsuit, which is described in Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. This lawsuit may divert our attention from our ordinary business operations, and we may incur significant expenses associated with it (including, without limitation, substantial attorneys\u2019 fees and other fees of professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers or directors who are or may become parties to or involved in such matters). We are unable at this time to predict the outcome of our potential liability in this matter, including what, if any, action the SEC might take in connection with this matter or the related internal investigation conducted by the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Depending on the outcome of the class action lawsuit, we may be required to pay material damages and fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, and/or suffer other penalties, remedies or sanctions, some or all of which may not be covered by insurance. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to meet our debt obligations and, consequently, could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. In addition, there is the potential for additional shareholder litigation and/or governmental investigations and we could be similarly materially and adversely affected by such matters. Any existing or future shareholder lawsuits and governmental investigations and/or any future governmental enforcement actions could also adversely impact our reputation, our relationships with our customers, and our ability to generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Our Customers\u2019 Industries\nDemand for pipeline construction services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil, natural gas and other fuel prices and the cost of energy infrastructure projects.\nDemand for our pipeline construction services is sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies and demand by industrial and utility customers. Prices for oil and natural gas are potentially subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas, as well as market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. An example is the recent volatility experienced by the oil markets due to declining oil prices beginning in the latter part of 2014. Decreasing prices for oil and natural gas generally depress levels of exploration, development and production activity, which could result in a corresponding decline in demand for, and/or our customers\u2019 ability to finance, pipeline construction services. Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:\n\u2022\nworld-wide levels of supply and demand for oil and natural gas generally, and demand for natural gas in the United States in particular;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, including policies regarding the exploration, production, development and transportation of oil and natural gas, as well as environmental laws and initiatives to control global warming;\n\u2022\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nworldwide political, military, and economic conditions; the level of oil production by non-Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) suppliers and available excess production capacity within OPEC;\n\u2022\noil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of producing and delivering oil and gas; and\n\u2022 potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.\nHistorically and recently, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. Spending on exploration and production activities by large oil and gas companies has a significant impact on the demand for pipeline construction services. Furthermore, pipelines have competition from rail and trucking companies that also transport hydrocarbons. In addition, demand for pipeline construction services may be affected by the costs of energy exploration and the construction of energy infrastructure projects. For example, while high oil and gas prices may increase oil and gas exploration, production and transportation activity, the associated increase in demand for equipment, materials and labor required for such exploration and activity may increase their costs and dampen demand for our services. Furthermore, increased costs for raw materials such as steel and other commodities may make some projects uneconomical despite robust oil and gas prices, thus reducing demand for our pipeline construction services. A decrease in demand for our pipeline construction services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nMany of the industries we serve are subject to customer consolidation, rapid technological and regulatory changes, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers\u2019 changing needs could result in decreased demand for our services.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the communications, utilities and power generation industries, which are subject to consolidation, rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Consolidation could result in the loss of one or more of, or affect spending by, our significant customers, including, for example, the July 2015 acquisition of DIRECTV\u00ae by AT&T, which could have an adverse effect on demand for our services. Changes in technology may reduce demand for the services we provide. For example, new or developing telecommunications technologies could displace existing technologies, such as the wireline systems used for the transmission of voice, video and data. Furthermore, improvements in existing technologies could allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Technological advances may also result in lower costs for sources of energy, which may render existing renewable energy and natural gas projects and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are developed in any of the industries we serve could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Furthermore, our customers in the communications, utilities and power generation industries face stringent regulatory and environmental requirements and permitting processes as they implement plans for their projects, which could result in delays, reductions and cancellations of some of their projects and which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nEconomic downturns could reduce capital expenditures in the industries we serve, which could result in decreased demand for our services.\nThe demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the U.S. economy and the economies of other countries in which we operate. During economic downturns, our customers may not have the ability to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure, or may have difficulty obtaining financing for planned projects. This has resulted, and in the future could result in cancellations of projects or deferral of projects to a later date. Such cancellations or deferrals could result in decreased demand for our services and could materially adversely affect the results of our operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, our customers are negatively affected by economic downturns that decrease the need for their services or the profitability of their services. Slow-downs in real estate, fluctuations in commodity prices and decreased demand by end-customers for services could affect our customers and their capital expenditure plans. We continually monitor our customers\u2019 industries and their relative health compared to the economy as a whole because we have previously been negatively impacted by economic downturns. Reductions in new housing starts, for example, have negatively affected our customers who utilize our services to construct their \u201clast mile\u201d of communications infrastructure, and such reductions have also had negative impacts on other industries we serve, including electrical utility transmission and grid connection as well as pipeline construction. Additionally, our customers who provide satellite and other communications services to consumers could be adversely impacted by an economic downturn if new subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumers are not ordered at the rate that our customers anticipate. During an economic downturn, our customers also may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure or may outsource less work. A decrease in any of these projects, new subscriptions or upgrades could negatively impact demand for the services we provide and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAdditionally, in the past, we incurred significant losses after a number of customers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial difficulties following a general economic downturn, in which certain industry factors worsened the impact of the overall economic downturn on those customers. In difficult economic times, some of our clients may find it difficult to pay invoices for our services on a timely basis, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it may be difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets. We also face competition from existing and prospective\ncustomers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the services we provide. There are relatively few barriers to entry into certain of the markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become a competitor. Most of our customers\u2019 work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often the principal factor that determines which service provider is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors sometimes win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements. However, our bids for certain projects may not be successful because of a customer\u2019s perception of our relative ability to perform the work as compared to our competitors or a customer\u2019s perception of technology advantages held by our competitors as well as other factors. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding for projects or renewing our master service agreements, or if our ability to win such projects or agreements requires that we accept lower margins. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers. As such, we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur failure to properly manage projects, or project delays, may result in additional costs or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nCertain of our engagements involve large-scale, complex projects that may occur over extended time periods. The quality of our performance on such a project depends in large part upon our ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees, or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones. Additionally, delays on a particular project, including delays in designs, engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from a customer\u2019s failure to timely obtain permits or rights-of-way or to meet other regulatory requirements, weather-related delays, permitting delays and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, may cause us to incur costs for standby pay, and may lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date. We also may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests to the siting of electric power, natural gas or oil transmission lines, solar or wind projects, or other facilities. In addition, some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines; therefore, any failure to properly estimate or manage cost or delays in the completion of projects, could subject us to penalties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers\u2019 expectations could result in large damage claims against us, and because of the substantial cost of, and potentially long lead-times necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used in our complex projects, such as pipeline and power generation, including renewable energy, damage claims may substantially exceed the amount we can charge for our associated services.\nWe may not accurately estimate the costs associated with services provided under fixed price contracts, which could impair our financial performance.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed-price master service and other service agreements. Under these contracts, we typically set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that costs associated with our performance may be greater than anticipated. In addition to master or other service agreements, we enter into contracts for specific projects or jobs that may require the installation or construction of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system. Under those agreements, we contractually agree to a price per unit. Profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates. We are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any expected losses on these projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the projects exceed the revenue to be earned on such units. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services. A variety of factors affect these costs, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, may cause actual project revenue and profits to differ from original estimates. As a result, if actual costs exceed our estimates, certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated, or losses, which could reduce our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can often occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays, changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost, both direct and indirect, or from project or contract terminations. From time to time, these claims can be the subject of lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.\nOur business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments, which could cause delays, increase our costs and reduce profitability.\nWe perform work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, challenging and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions. Performing work under such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations, potentially causing us to incur additional, unanticipated costs, reductions in revenue or the payment of liquidated damages. In addition, some of our contracts require that we assume the risk should actual site conditions vary from those expected. Some of our projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases, which may occur over extended time periods. We may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and material delivery delays, schedule changes, delays from customer failure to timely obtain rights-of-way, weather-related delays, delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of the project and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, but which impact our ability to\ncomplete a project as originally scheduled. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of such costs. Any such delays or cancellations or errors or other failures to meet customer expectations could result in damage claims substantially in excess of the revenue associated with a project. Delays or cancellations could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts.\nWe recognize revenue from installation/construction fixed price contracts, as well as for certain projects pursuant to master and other service agreements, using the percentage-of-completion method; therefore, variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability.\nWe recognize revenue from installation/construction fixed price contracts, as well as for certain projects pursuant to master and other service agreements, using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is the percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method, therefore, relies on estimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions, judgment and experience, but are subject to the risks inherent in estimates, including unanticipated delays or technical complications. Variation of actual results from estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller projects could be material. We immediately recognize the full amount of an estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss. Such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability, which could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations. See discussion of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in Part II - Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this 2014 Form 10-K.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers and the loss of one or more of these customers, or a reduction in their demand for our services, could impair our financial performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we derived approximately 21%, 12% and 8% of our revenue from AT&T, DIRECTV\u00ae and Enbridge, Inc., respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we derived approximately 18%, 18% and 14% of our revenue from AT&T, Enbridge, Inc. and DIRECTV\u00ae, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we derived approximately 18% and 17% of our revenue from AT&T and DIRECTV\u00ae, respectively. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 65%, 69% and 65% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In July 2015, AT&T acquired DIRECTV\u00ae. On a combined basis, AT&T and DIRECTV\u00ae represented 33%, 32% and 34% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Taking into consideration the acquisition of DIRECTV\u00ae by AT&T, our top ten customers would have accounted for 66%, 71% and 67% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers, and certain of our services are provided on a non-recurring, project by project basis, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be negatively affected if these customers reduce the amount of business they provide to us, or if we complete the required work on our projects for these customers and cannot replace them with similar projects. Just over half of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was derived from non-recurring project specific work. In addition, many of the contracts with our largest customers may be canceled on short or no advance notice. Any of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads. If we do not receive future contract awards, if these awards are delayed, or if there is a significant reduction in the level of work we provide under master service agreements, we could incur significant costs and reduced profitability from underutilization of our workforce.\nOur estimates of future performance and results of operations depend on, among other matters, whether and when we will receive certain new contract awards, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is impacted by a variety of factors including our ability to manage attrition, our ability to forecast our need for services, which allows us to maintain an appropriately sized workforce, our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new projects or between internal business groups and our need to devote resources to non-chargeable activities such as training or business development. While our estimates are based upon our good faith judgment, these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information. In the case of large-scale projects where timing is often uncertain, it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award. The uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contract needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could reduce our profits and cash flows.\nMost of our contracts may be canceled on short or no advance notice, which could reduce our revenue, and certain of our contracts with customers are subject to their ability to secure financing or other conditions and therefore may not result in revenue or profits.\nMost of our contracts are cancelable on short or no advance notice, ranging from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon 180 days notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Many of our contracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to public bid. We may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also provide a significant portion of our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction in our revenue, profitability and liquidity if: (i) our customers cancel a significant number of contracts; (ii) we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid; or (iii) we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into contracts that contain financing or other conditions, which must be satisfied before we may begin work; therefore, certain of these contracts may not result in revenue or profits if our customers are unable to obtain financing or to satisfy any other conditions associated with such projects.\nClaims, lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, liquidated damages, consequential damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, pursuant to our service agreements, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide. Claimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs. When appropriate, we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to case developments. See Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. If our legal reserves are inadequate, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or becomes unavailable, or our self-insurance liabilities are higher than expected, we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, an adverse determination on any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business, and cause us to incur significant expenses. There can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay, or delay paying us for the related services.\nWe use subcontractors to perform portions of our services. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. We could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity if we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers that fail to pay, or delay paying us for the related work.\nOur subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these relationships, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe depend on subcontractors to perform work on some of our projects. There is a risk that we may have disputes with subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractors, customer concerns about the subcontractors or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract. If any of our subcontractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services, then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. In addition, the absence of qualified subcontractors with which we have satisfactory relationships could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials for certain projects. We also rely on equipment manufacturers and lessors to provide us with the equipment we require to conduct our operations. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier or equipment manufacturer or lessor, any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers or equipment could negatively affect our operations. Market and economic conditions may contribute to a lack of available suppliers or equipment. To the extent we cannot acquire materials or equipment, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur participation in investment arrangements, including contractual joint ventures, exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.\nAs part of our business, we have entered into various investment arrangements, including contractual joint ventures, and may enter into additional such arrangements in the future. The purpose of these joint ventures is typically to combine our skills and resources with those of others to allow for the performance of particular projects. Success on these jointly performed projects depends in large part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner\u2019s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to adequately address our partner\u2019s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. for discussion pertaining to certain of our equity method and other investment arrangements.\nOur operations in existing international markets, or expanding into additional international markets, may not be successful and could expose us to risks, including the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery laws, which could harm our business and prospects.\nWe derived 15% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 from international markets, and we may further expand the volume of international services we provide as well as the foreign geographic territories in which we operate. Our international operations are presently conducted primarily in Canada, Mexico and in other countries in Latin America, but we have performed work in various other foreign countries, and revenue derived from, or the number of countries in which we operate, could expand over the next few years. Economic conditions, including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts, or volatility in the global markets may adversely affect our customers, their demand for our services and their ability to pay for our services. In addition, there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally, including, but not limited to, potential instability in international markets, changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations, foreign currency fluctuations, exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings, political, economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including tax laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). These risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers or to operate our international business profitably, and our overall business and results of operations could be negatively affected by our foreign activities.\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and our agents comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged FCPA violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\nWe are subject to foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations, and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations, as well as mitigate our foreign exchange risk through hedging transactions may be limited.\nWe generally attempt to denominate our contracts in U.S. dollars or in the currencies of our costs. In the past, however, we have entered, and in the future we may enter, into new contracts in Canada, Mexico and in other countries in Latin America and/or other foreign locations that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, subjecting us to currency risk exposure, particularly when the contract revenue is denominated in a currency different from the contract costs. Certain portions of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating expenses are in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to significant foreign currency risks, including risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.\nOur business is labor intensive, and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover. In addition, given the nature of the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees are trained in and possess specialized technical skills. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve, it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a sufficiently skilled labor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. We may also be forced to incur significant training expenses if we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills. Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages, increased labor or training costs, or the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe renewable energy industry is heavily reliant on tax incentives, the availability of which may be uncertain and could adversely affect demand for our services.\nBecause the unsubsidized cost of electric power from renewable resources such as wind and solar often exceeds that of fossil fuel and nuclear generating facilities, the renewable energy industry is heavily reliant on tax incentives. These tax incentives effectively reduce the market price at which renewable energy can be sold, which spurs investment in renewable energy facilities. These tax incentives, however, have a finite duration. The finite duration of these tax incentives creates uncertainty for developers of renewable energy facilities and may adversely affect investment in them and, accordingly, demand for our services. Accordingly, we cannot predict the impact that tax incentive legislation will have on the demand for our services. For example, the current election to claim the investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit is available only for qualified wind facilities on which construction commenced prior to January 1, 2015, and generally must be completed by December 31, 2015. Additionally, the 30% investment tax credit for qualified solar projects will only be available for projects placed in service prior to January 1, 2017. The production tax credit for wind projects applies to qualifying projects for which the construction commencement date was prior to January 1, 2015, with a required completion date prior to January 1, 2017, and will not be available for energy generated from wind facilities on which construction commences after that date, unless the production tax credit is extended or renewed. Whether the investment tax credit will be effective in the future for wind, solar or other renewable energy projects is uncertain, as are any future efforts to extend or renew the production tax credit and the investment tax credit. Furthermore, the provisions regarding any extension or renewal may not be as favorable as those that currently exist. We cannot assure you that any extension or renewal of the production tax credit and/or the investment tax credit would be enacted prior to its expiration or, if allowed to expire, that any extension or renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive effect. We also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for accelerated and bonus depreciation with respect to wind or solar energy generation assets will not be modified, amended or repealed in the future. If the investment tax credit is not effective or if the federal production tax credit is not extended or renewed, or is extended or renewed at a lower rate, these generating facilities may be less profitable to build and operate and the ability of our customers to obtain financing for these projects may be impaired or eliminated. As a result, our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if demand for our services or the tax incentives were reduced.\nChanges to renewable portfolio standards could, and decreased demand for renewable energy projects would, negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nA portion of our business provides construction and/or installation services to owners and operators of wind power, solar power and other renewable energy facilities. The development of wind, solar and other renewable energy facilities is highly dependent upon federal tax credits, the existence of renewable portfolio standards and other tax or state incentives. Renewable portfolio standards are state specific statutory provisions requiring that electric utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources or devote a certain portion of operational/development capacity to renewable energy sources. Additionally, certified renewable energy generators earn certificates for every megawatt hour of electricity they produce and can sell these along with their electricity to their customers. In the past, these standards have spurred growth in the renewable energy industry and demand for renewable energy infrastructure construction services. However, revenue from renewable energy projects in the past have been, and in the future are expected to continue to be, highly volatile. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories,\nhave adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals. Elimination of, or changes to, existing renewable portfolio standards or similar environmental policies may negatively affect demand for our services. Additionally, renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup. The locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are not viable unless connection to the grid to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available, particularly during periods of tight credit markets. These factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated or a delay in the timing of construction of these projects and the related infrastructure, which would negatively affect demand for our services.\nOur failure to comply with the regulations of OSHA, the U.S. DOT and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by OSHA and various recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards and safety in excavation and demolition work, may apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of business in complying with OSHA and other state and local laws and regulations, and could incur penalties and fines in the future, including, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions.\nWhile we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability. Although we have taken what we believe to be appropriate precautions, we have had employee injuries and fatalities in the past and may suffer additional injuries or fatalities in the future. Serious accidents of this nature may subject us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Personal injury claims for damages, including for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record were to deteriorate, or if we suffered substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, customers could cancel existing contracts and not award future business to us, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. We have, from time to time, received notice from the DOT that our motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges. If we were not able to successfully resolve such issues, our ability to service our customers could be damaged, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nMany of our customers are highly regulated and new regulations or changes in existing regulations may adversely impact demand for our services and/or the profitability of those services. In addition, the adoption of any future federal, state, or local laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on growth in oil and gas related infrastructure development.\nMany of our communications customers are regulated by the FCC, and our energy customers are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d). In addition, our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions. These agencies could change the way in which they interpret the application of current regulations and/or may impose additional regulations. Interpretative changes or new regulations having an adverse effect on our customers and the profitability of the services they provide could reduce demand for our services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAdditionally, various federal, state, local, or foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken, which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. These regulations, and any future restrictions which might be adopted, could lead to operational delays and increased operating costs for our customers in the oil and gas industry that could result in reduced capital spending. The Company could also be negatively impacted by delays and/or cancellations of future oil and gas infrastructure projects.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.\nSome of the work we perform is in underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we may be liable for fines and damages. We own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines. Additionally, we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials. These releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThere are also other legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions. These proposals, if enacted, could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. Any of these actions could result in increased costs associated with our operations and impact the prices we charge our customers. For example, if new regulations are adopted regulating greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks, we could experience a significant increase in environmental compliance costs in light of our large fleet and amount of construction machinery owned. In addition, if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could suffer.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, polychlorinated biphenyls (\u201cPCBs\u201d), fuel storage and air quality. Certain of our current and historical construction operations have used hazardous materials and, to the extent that such materials are not properly stored, contained or recycled, they could become hazardous waste. Additionally, some of our contracts require that we assume the environmental risk of site conditions and require that we indemnify our customers for any damages, including environmental damages, incurred in connection with our projects. We may be subject to claims under various environmental laws and regulations, federal and state statutes and/or common law doctrines for toxic torts and other damages, as well as for natural resource damages and the investigation and clean up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media under laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). Such claims may arise, for example, out of current or former conditions at project sites, current or former properties owned or leased by us, and contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties. Liability may be imposed without regard to fault and may be strict and joint and several, such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share, and may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties causing the contamination.\nOur inability to enforce non-competition agreements with former principals and key management of the businesses we acquire may adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we generally require that key management and former principals of the businesses we acquire enter into non-competition agreements in our favor. Enforceability of these non-competition agreements varies from state to state, and state courts will generally examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a non-competition agreement; consequently, we cannot predict with certainty whether, if challenged, a court will enforce any particular non-competition agreement. If one or more former principals or members of key management of the businesses we acquire leave and the courts refuse to enforce the non-competition agreement entered into by such person or persons, we might be subject to increased competition, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may incur goodwill impairment charges, which could harm our profitability.\nWhen we acquire a business, we record goodwill equal to the excess of the amount we pay for the business, including anticipated future liabilities, over the fair value of the acquired net assets of that business. As a result of our acquisitions, we have $1.3 billion of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2014. We expect to continue to record additions to goodwill in future periods in connection with completed acquisitions, including goodwill resulting from future earn-out payments for acquisitions that closed prior to January 1, 2009, in accordance with U.S. GAAP for such acquisitions. We periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether such carrying values exceed their fair market values. We may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with any of our acquisitions in the future if the markets they serve or their businesses deteriorate.\nOur business is subject to physical hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition.\nConstruction projects undertaken by us expose our employees to electrical lines, pipelines carrying potentially explosive or toxic materials, heavy equipment, mechanical failures, transportation accidents, adverse weather conditions and the risk of damage to equipment and property. These hazards can cause personal injuries and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations and large damage claims which could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount we charge for the associated services. In addition, if serious accidents or fatalities occur, or our safety records were to deteriorate, we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining other new contracts and certain existing contracts could be terminated. Our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus. The occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities, employee turnover, increase the costs of our projects, or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers, which could materially adversely affect our revenue, profitability and liquidity.\nIncreases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins.\nThe price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Any increase in fuel costs could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity because most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing.\nOur business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers, exposing us to variable quarterly results.\nSome of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the calendar year. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, can also affect our ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of North America. As a result, we generally experience reduced revenue in the first quarter of each calendar year. Natural catastrophes such as hurricanes or other severe weather could also have, and have had, a negative impact on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAcquisitions involve risks that could negatively affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe have made, and in the future may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment opportunities, or may be unable to obtain any required consent of our lenders and therefore may not be able\nto complete such acquisitions or strategic investments. We may pay for acquisitions or strategic investments with our common stock or with convertible securities, which may dilute the ownership interests of our common shareholders, or we may decide to pursue acquisitions with which our investors may not agree. In connection with most of our acquisitions, we have agreed to substantial earn-out arrangements. To the extent we defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition through a cash earn-out arrangement, it will reduce our cash flows in subsequent periods. In addition, acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business\u2019 operations, financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business;\n\u2022\nthe expense of integrating acquired businesses including, for example, our recent acquisition of WesTower Communications Inc. (\u201cWesTower\u201d), which resulted in acquisition integration costs in 2014 and is expected to result in additional integration costs in 2015;\n\u2022\nincreased indebtedness and contingent earn-out obligations;\n\u2022\nthe ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties;\n\u2022\nthe availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.\nIn addition, acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations. We cannot assure you that the indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties we assume upon consummation of an acquisition. We may learn additional information about our acquired businesses that could materially adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities, unprofitable projects and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Borrowings or issuances of convertible debt associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms.\nWe may incur restructuring charges, which could reduce our profitability.\nFrom time to time, we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability. In the past, we have, and in the future, could incur charges as a result of eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business plan, charges associated with the integration of acquired businesses, reducing or eliminating services or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margins, reducing costs of reporting units that need margin improvements, or as a result of identification of business opportunities that utilize our existing human and physical resources. Any charges related to restructuring or impairment would be reflected as operating expenses and could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity.\nWe rely on information, communications and data systems in our operations. Systems and information technology interruption and breaches in data security could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.\nWe are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays. Our operations could be interrupted or delayed or our data security could be breached if we are unable to add software and hardware, effectively maintain and upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of and protect our systems. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, acts of war or terrorism, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions, including breaches by computer hackers and cyber-terrorists. Any of these or other events could cause system interruption, delays and/or loss of critical data including private data, could delay or prevent operations including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results, loss of data, processing inefficiency, downtime, or could result in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information and could adversely affect our operating results. Similar risks may affect our customers and vendors, indirectly affecting us. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nMany of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us.\nApproximately half of our revenue is derived from multi-year master service agreements and other service agreements. Under our multi-year master service agreements and other service agreements, we contract to provide customers with individual project services through work orders within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis. Under these agreements, our customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. A significant decline in the projects customers assign us under these service agreements could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAmounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits. Our backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments and therefore is an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\nA significant portion of our 18-month backlog as of December 31, 2014 was composed of master service agreements and other service agreements, none of which require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short or no advance notice. The\nbalance of our backlog is our estimate of work to be completed on long-term installation/construction fixed price agreements. These backlog amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period, or at all. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions, other project deferrals or delays, scope adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. If our backlog fails to materialize, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future earnings.\nCertain of our businesses have employees who are represented by a union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements; the unionized workforce and any related obligations could adversely affect our operations.\nCertain of our employees are represented by labor unions and collective bargaining agreements. Although all such collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur despite the terms of these agreements. Strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue. Additionally, as current agreements expire, the labor unions may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements on terms favorable to their members, or at all, or avoid strikes, lockouts or other labor actions from time to time that may affect their members. Therefore, it cannot be assured that new agreements will be reached with employee labor unions as existing contracts expire, or on terms that we find desirable. Any labor action against us relating to failure to reach an agreement with employee labor unions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our union and collective bargaining agreements require us to participate with other companies in multi-employer pension plans. To the extent that U.S.-registered plans are underfunded defined benefit plans, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (\u201cERISA\u201d), may subject us to substantial liabilities if we withdraw from such multi-employer plans or if they are terminated. Under current law pertaining to employers who are contributors to U.S.-registered multi-employer defined benefit plans, a plan\u2019s termination, an employer\u2019s voluntary partial or complete withdrawal from, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from, an underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan requires participating employers to make payments to the plan for their proportionate share of the multi-employer plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits of the plan for all plan participants, not only for benefits payable to participants of the contributing employer. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if the other participating employers cease to contribute to, or withdraw from, the plan. The allocable portion of liability to participating employers could be more disproportionate if employers that have withdrawn from the plan are insolvent, or if they otherwise fail to pay their proportionate share of the withdrawal liability. We currently contribute, and in the past have contributed to, plans that are underfunded, and, therefore, could have potential liability associated with a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from, or termination of, these plans. While we do not currently have plans to withdraw from, and are not aware of related liabilities associated with these plans, there can be no assurance that we will not be assessed liabilities in the future. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (\u201cPPA\u201d) added funding rules to U.S.-registered plans classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered,\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. The PPA requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on their level of underfunding. If plans are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or participating employers could be required to make additional contributions. In addition, if a multi-employer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may impose on the employers contributing to such a plan a nondeductible excise tax of 5% of the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency.\nBased upon the information available to us from plan administrators as of December 31, 2014, several of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate are underfunded and, as a result, the Company could be required to increase its contributions. We have also been notified that certain plans to which our subsidiaries contribute are in \u201ccritical\u201d status and require additional contributions in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. As a result, we expect our required contributions to these plans to increase in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. The amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts are based on future levels of work employees of the union covered by these plans, investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans.\nIn November 2014, we, along with other members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association (\u201cPLCA\u201d), voluntarily terminated our participation in several defined benefit multi-employer pension plans for which there was no withdrawal liability assessed as of the date we terminated our participation. Although we do not believe we have any material liability associated with our termination of participation, there can be no assurance that these plans, which were in critical status as of the date we terminated our participation, will not assess penalties in the future. Additionally, in November 2011, we, along with other members of the PLCA, voluntarily withdrew from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (\u201cCentral States\u201d), a defined benefit multi-employer pension plan. In connection with this withdrawal, we established a withdrawal liability reserve of $6.4 million based on an estimate provided by the Central States administrator as of the date of withdrawal. We withdrew from Central States in order to mitigate our liability in connection with the plan, which is in critical status. The plan, however, has asserted that the PLCA members did not effectively withdraw in 2011 and are responsible for a withdrawal liability that includes 2011 contribution amounts. By letter dated March 14, 2013, Central States demanded from us approximately $11 million in withdrawal liability, which included 2011 contribution amounts. We are vigorously opposing this demand because we believe that we legally and effectively withdrew from Central States on November 15, 2011. If Central States were to prevail in its assertion that we withdrew after that date, then the initial amount of our withdrawal liability could increase to approximately $11 million. In addition, if Central States or other plans from which we have withdrawn were to undergo a mass withdrawal, as defined by ERISA and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, within the three-year period commencing with the beginning of the calendar year during which the Company effectively withdrew from the plan, we could have additional liability. Given the uncertain nature of these factors, the ultimate withdrawal liability can only be estimated. Withdrawal liabilities,\nrequirements to pay increased contributions, and/or excise taxes in connection with any of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate could negatively impact our cash flows, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur financial results are based, in part, upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Key estimates include: the recognition of revenue and project profit or loss (which we define as project revenue less project costs of revenue, including depreciation) in particular, on long-term construction contracts or other projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, for which the recorded amounts require estimates of costs to complete projects, ultimate project profit and the amount of contract price adjustments that are probable; allowances for doubtful accounts; estimated fair values of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition-related contingent consideration, investments in cost and equity method investees; asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization; accrued self-insured claims; share-based compensation; other reserves and accruals; accounting for income taxes; and the estimated impact of contingencies and ongoing litigation. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 2 - Independent Investigation of the Audit Committee and Related Restatements in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities associated with our domestic and international operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Management must exercise significant judgment in determining our provision for income taxes due to lack of clear and concise tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions. Tax laws may be changed or clarified and such changes may adversely affect our tax provisions. We are audited by various U.S. and foreign tax authorities and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in our financial statements.\nWe are self-insured against many potential liabilities.\nWe are effectively self-insured for substantially all claims because most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including losses incurred but not reported, and reflect the present value of those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. The determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the related liability is reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or if costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.\nWarranty claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe generally warrant the work we perform for a one to two-year period following substantial completion of a project, subject to further extensions of the warranty period following repairs or replacements. We have not historically accrued reserves for potential warranty claims as they have been immaterial, but such claims could potentially increase. While we generally require that the materials suppliers provide us have warranties that are consistent with those we provide to our customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are not reimbursed. The costs associated with such warranties, including any warranty-related legal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur revolving credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders. The prohibited actions include, among other things:\n\u2022\nbuying back shares in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\nmaking investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\npaying cash dividends;\n\u2022\ncreating certain liens against our assets;\n\u2022\nprepaying subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengaging in certain mergers or combinations;\n\u2022\nfailing to satisfy certain financial tests; and\n\u2022\nengaging in transactions that would result in a \u201cchange of control\u201d (as defined in the credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes).\nOur credit facility requires that we comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility, we would be required to obtain consents from our bank group, further modify the credit facility or secure another source of financing to continue to operate our business, neither of which may be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. A default could also result in the acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility or under the indentures relating to our senior notes. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed. Our business is capital intensive and, to the extent we need additional financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms, which may materially decrease our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings, and the need for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility.\nSome of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. If we are not able to renew or obtain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, we may be precluded from being able to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds, which would reduce availability under our credit facility. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding.\nWe may incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the U.S. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. The changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and other costs, although we do not expect any material short-term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation. We are continuing to assess the extent of any long-term impact from the legislation.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Common Stock\nThere may be future sales of our common stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In connection with certain completed acquisitions, we have issued shares of our common stock, and we additionally have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash as consideration for future earn-out obligations. We may agree to issue additional securities in connection with other future acquisition or financing transactions, which, if issued, would dilute your share ownership and could lead to volatility in our common stock price.\nWe grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of equity securities. In connection with certain completed acquisitions, we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of paying cash for certain earn-out obligations. Such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that we may issue up to a total 145,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 84,738,644 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2014.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions, convertible securities or other issuances of our common stock, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and/or options, or otherwise, will dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $100 million share repurchase program, under which we repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares of our common stock in the first of half of 2015, for an aggregate purchase price of $100 million, which completed the share repurchase program. We cannot predict the impact of such repurchases on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which could trigger events of default that result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate requirements, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to increased interest expense related to our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under our credit facility;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and\n\u2022\npreventing us from paying dividends.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, and some of these activities may be on terms that are unfavorable or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange has been volatile in recent years. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our customers' industries;\n\u2022\ncapital spending plans of our significant customers;\n\u2022\nglobal and domestic energy prices;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or one of our competitors of new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities, including any shares issued in connection with business acquisitions or earn-out obligations for any past or future acquisitions.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years, which have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. Volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause shareholders to lose some or all of their investment in our common stock.\nA small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions.\nJorge Mas, our Chairman, Jos\u00e9 R. Mas, our Chief Executive Officer, and other members of the Mas family employed by MasTec, beneficially owned approximately 18.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2014. Accordingly, they are in a position to influence:\n\u2022\nthe vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe nomination of individuals to our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\na change in our control.\nThese factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests or that might result in shareholders receiving a premium for their common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and certain provisions of Florida law contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws and the Florida Business Corporation Act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock. For example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our Board of Directors. Consequently, it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our Board of\nDirectors, which may discourage hostile takeover bids. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of holders of our common stock, including the granting of voting control to others, which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control.", "PERMNO": 19880, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "MTZ"}
