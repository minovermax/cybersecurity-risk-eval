Additional risks not presently known to or understood by us may also negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur recurring losses from operations, negative operating cash flows and need to obtain cash flow from operations or adequate funding to fund our comprehensive recovery plan raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.\nIn their report dated March 9, 2017, which is also included in this Form 10-K, our independent registered public accounting firm stated that our consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming we would continue as a going concern; however, our recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and liquidity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after issuance date of the financial statements. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern (which contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future). These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7 for further discussion.\nReduction in cash flow from operations in 2017 may limit our ability to make the desired level of investment in our businesses and may result in a continuation of our liquidity issues.\nWe are taking steps to address and correct the primary causes of recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and liquidity concerns primarily through the acquisition of AHS and raising additional equity. We used approximately $4.4 million of cash in operations in 2016. If revenue growth does not continue as expected, our cost reduction measures are not successful, or we are unable to maintain our current receivable collection results, we may be unable to make needed investments in our operations or to comply with our debt covenants and have sufficient eligible receivables to maintain borrowing capacity under our Credit and Security Agreement, as amended on August 15, 2016, and November 15, 2016, (the \"2016 Credit and Security Agreement\") with SCM Specialty Finance Opportunities Fund, L.P. (\"SCM\"). In addition, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Merger Agreement signed on March 7, 2017.\nOur liquidity may be adversely affected by the terms of our 2016 Credit and Security Agreement and the Credit Agreement.\nIf we need to borrow in the future under our 2016 Credit and Security Agreement, the amount available for borrowing may be less than the $7 million under this facility at any given time due to the manner in which the maximum available amount is calculated. We have an available borrowing base subject to reserves established at the lender's discretion of 85% of Eligible Receivables up to $7 million under this facility. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $3.6 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit and Security Agreement, with unused borrowing capacity of $0.1 million. As of February 28, 2017, the Company had $3.1 million of outstanding borrowings with unused borrowing capacity of $0.2 million.\nThe 2016 Credit and Security Agreement, as amended, contains customary representations and warranties and various affirmative and negative covenants including minimum aggregate revenue, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization), and consolidated unencumbered liquid assets requirements. Noncompliance with these covenants constitutes an event of default. As of December 31, 2016, we met the required minimum covenants. Refer to Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. There can be no assurance that cash flows from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be obtainable in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Merger Agreement signed on March 7, 2017.\nWe incurred additional indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of AHS, and such increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations and did result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nIn order to fund the Acquisition, we entered into and consummated a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with SWK Funding LLC (\"SWK\") on April 17, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides us with a $5.0 million term loan (the \"Term Loan\"). As a result, we have indebtedness that is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the Acquisition of AHS. This higher level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other investments, and use for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates on our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates or when such indebtedness is being refinanced;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges related to our business and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\nWe cannot assure you that cash flows from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be obtainable in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The Credit Agreement, as amended, contains customary representations and warranties and various affirmative and negative covenants including minimum aggregate revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and consolidated unencumbered liquid assets requirements. Noncompliance with these covenants constitutes an event of default. As of December 31, 2016, we met the required minimum covenants. Refer to Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. There can be no assurance that cash flows from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be obtainable in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Merger Agreement signed on March 7, 2017.\nFailure to complete the Merger may result in us paying a termination fee or reimbursing expenses to Provant and could harm our common stock price, future business and operations.\nIf the merger is not completed, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we would be required to pay Provant a termination fee equal to the greater of $500,000 or the third-party expenses incurred by Provant, up to a maximum of $750,000;\n\u2022\nthe price of our stock may decline and remain volatile; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided to us in the Merger on a timely basis, or at all. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Merger Agreement signed on March 7, 2017.\nWeakness in the economy in general, or the financial health or performance of the healthcare industry and healthcare sponsors in particular, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive our revenues from customers in the healthcare industry, including healthcare sponsors. If the condition of the U.S. economy weakens in certain areas, such as an increase in unemployment rates, demand for biometric screenings may decline in the future, resulting in less business for our Company. If some of our healthcare customers fail or curtail operations in the healthcare industry, such failures or curtailments of operations would result in less business for our Company. Either event would negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actions taken by Congress with respect to repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act could have a detrimental impact on the healthcare industry and our healthcare customers that could lead to or worsen the effects of the events described in this paragraph.\nOur business results would be adversely affected if we were alleged or found to have violated certain regulatory requirements.\nOur business is subject to varying degrees of state and federal regulation. For example, our operations are subject to regulations regarding licensing (supervision of phlebotomists, the conduct of certain specimen draws, and requirements for conducting health screening fairs). We are subject to federal and state laws, including testing and collection regulations and HIPAA rules, regarding security and privacy of personal health information and other personal information. Although we devote substantial effort to comply with these regulatory requirements, there is a continuing risk that regulators may find compliance violations, which could subject us to significant liability and/or damage our relationship with our customers.\nOur business results may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and deploy health professionals and other medical personnel.\nWe believe a key to growth in our health and wellness operations is maintaining and managing a large, national network of highly trained medical personnel who can meet our customers' needs in markets nationwide. Although many of our health professionals also work for competitors, our goal is to offer them equal or greater opportunities so that they will be available to provide services to our customers. If we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriate base of health professionals, it may limit our ability to maintain and/or grow our screening operations.\nFuture claims arising from the sale of our business units (discontinued operations) could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf claims for which we may be liable arise related to our previous discontinued operations in the future, this may result in additional cost to us which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a limited number of customers and a loss of some or all of the business of one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMuch of our business is derived through our relationships with our channel partners. Our two largest channel partners, combined, account for just over 30% of our consolidated revenue. While we have agreements with each of our channel partners, the vast majority of the agreements do not provide for any specified minimum level of purchases of services from us. If one or more of our channel partners was to significantly reduce its purchases of biometric screening and other sample collection services from us, it could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. If this were to occur, we would face significant challenges in replacing the lost revenues.\nA number of circumstances could prompt the loss of one or more of our key customers or a substantial portion of its or their business. For example, if one of our customers were to be acquired by or merged into another company for whom we do not provide services, we could lose the acquired company\u2019s business. We could lose one or more significant customers if they perceive one or more of our competitors to be superior in price or quality and choose not to renew our contract.\nCompetition could negatively impact our business.\nThe health and wellness industry is competitive, which could result in loss of our market share due to pressure to reduce prices or increase services without charging additional fees. For screenings, we compete primarily with private companies who provide screenings in certain geographic areas in the United States with few having the ability to service customers nationally like we do. For health and wellness, we compete primarily with established wellness and care management providers, startup companies, and health plans that offer their own proprietary solutions. We are one of the only health and wellness providers that offers a fully integrated, end-to-end screening and wellness solution to our customers which we believe gives us an advantage over our competitors who also serve companies with 500 to 5,000 employees, our primary target market. If one of the national health and wellness companies that currently focuses on larger employers were to develop a service offering in our target market at a lower price point than we offer, we could lose market share or be forced to cut our prices and lose margin in order to retain customers.\nWe are dependent on Clinical Reference Laboratory, Inc. as our exclusive laboratory services provider. If CRL fails to perform adequately under the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement or we face difficulties in managing our relationship with CRL, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement (\"LLASA\") between the Company and CRL, which became effective August 31, 2014, CRL is the Company\u2019s exclusive provider, with certain limited exceptions, of laboratory testing and reporting services in support of our screening services. The LLASA has a term of 5 years and will automatically renew for an additional 5 year period unless sooner terminated. Our dependence on CRL makes our operations vulnerable to CRL\u2019s failure to perform adequately under our contract with them. In addition, the services that CRL renders to us are services that we are required to provide under contracts with our clients, and we are responsible for such performance and could be held accountable by the client for any failure to perform. The LLASA has service level requirements of CRL and we perform ongoing oversight activities to identify any performance or other issues related to our relationship with CRL. If CRL were to fail to provide the services that we require or expect, or fails to meet its contractual requirements, such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to serve our customers and/or subject us to regulatory or litigation risk. Such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we cannot successfully implement, maintain and upgrade our information technology platforms so that we can meet customer requirements, the competitiveness of our businesses will suffer.\nThe speed and accuracy with which we make information available to our customers is critical. As a result, we are dependent on our information technology platforms and our ability to store, retrieve, process, manage and enable timely and secure customer access to the health-related and other data we gather on behalf of our customers. Disruption of the operation of our IT systems for any extended period of time, loss of stored data, programming errors or other system failures could cause customers to turn elsewhere to address their service needs. In addition, we must continue to enhance our IT systems, with potentially substantial cost, as the need for service, product and technology requirements advances. In addition, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, and spamming could harm our business and results of operations.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health professionals or other personnel could result in claims against us and/or our incurring expenses to indemnify our clients.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health or other medical professionals could result in claims against us, require us to indemnify our clients for any harm they may suffer, or damage our reputation and relationships with important clients. Our clients rely on the accuracy of the medical data we gather on their behalf in aggregated form to manage their wellness program. We maintain professional liability insurance and such other coverage as we believe appropriate, but such insurance may prove insufficient. Regardless of insurance, any such claims could damage our reputation and relationships with important clients.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income or future tax may be limited due to the changes in ownership (within the meaning of IRC Section 382) that have occurred in the past and will occur upon the consummation of the Merger.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income, and an ownership change is generally defined as a cumulative change of 50% or more in the ownership positions of certain shareholders during a rolling three year period. The ownership change occurring as a result of the Merger is likely to eliminate or restrict our ability to use our NOL carry forwards.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by the effects of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism.\nOur operations would be adversely affected in the event of a natural disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, or an act of terrorism. A natural disaster or act of terrorism could disrupt our ability to provide testing services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address that weakness or if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe have identified certain deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for non-routine transactions that we deemed to be a material weakness. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. We determined that the complexities of the accounting for these non-routine transactions adversely affected management\u2019s review of the accounting for non-routine, complex technical accounting matters to ensure proper application of generally accepted accounting principles in a timely manner.\nWhile the material weakness continues to exist, we have taken steps to address this weakness in internal control. We plan to enhance our controls related to non-routine transactions by supplementing with additional resources as necessary, enhancing the design and documentation of management review controls, and improving the documentation of internal control procedures. Despite these measures and planned improvements, our remediation efforts could be insufficient to address the material weakness in the future.\nWe must increase our shareholders\u2019 equity by May 8, 2017, to avoid a delisting action by the NYSE MKT.\nThe NYSE MKT notified us on April 1, 2016, that we have fallen out of compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide because we reported shareholders\u2019 equity of less than $6.0 million in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and we have had net losses in our five most recent fiscal years. As a result, we were required to submit a\nplan to regain compliance prior to May 8, 2017. The NYSE MKT accepted the plan. If we fail to fulfill it in the allotted time, our shares may be delisted from the Exchange.", "PERMNO": 42455, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "HPHWQ"}
