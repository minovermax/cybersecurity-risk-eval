{"cik": "22252", "company": "COMARCO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-05-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks continue or newly occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would further suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely further decline and you might lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our operations and business results.\nWe effectively suspended our traditional operations as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Our ability to generate positive cash flow, if any, from these activities is speculative and subject to a number of uncertainties. If we do not improve our cash position in the near term, we may be forced to cease operations, in which event you may lose your entire investment in us.\nWe are now focused on potentially realizing value from our ongoing or future IP enforcement actions and other litigation as well as further exploring opportunities to expand, protect, and monetize our patent portfolio, including through the potential sale or licensing of some of all of our patent portfolio. While we have little experience or track record in generating revenues from these non-traditional methods, we have executed two settlement agreements through fiscal 2016 and one additional settlement agreement in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There can be no guarantees that we will execute additional agreements in the future.\nOur ability to generate revenue from ongoing or future litigation is subject to a number of significant uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our ability to retain counsel on an alternative fee structure basis or otherwise fund the cost of litigation and litigation counsel, the validity of our claims, our ability to succeed on the merits of our claims, interpretation of applicable contracts and laws (which in many cases are complex and potentially subject to competing interpretations), our ability to sustain operations through the final adjudication of our various litigation proceedings, and other uncertainties inherent in the litigation process. In addition, it is likely that we will become subject to counterclaims in any litigation to which we are a party, which may result in us being subject to damages or other obligations.\nSimilarly, our ability to monetize our technology through licensing or sale is speculative and subject to a number of factors, including the outcome of litigation concerning our patent portfolio and the actual and perceived value of our intellectual property in the marketplace. To date, we have entered into three agreements to license our intellectual property to third parties, which have resulted in nominal revenues to date.\nAny failure to realize value from our ongoing or future litigation or efforts to monetize our patent portfolio is expected to have a material adverse impact on our already limited financial resources, which could cause us to cease operations or otherwise cause you to lose your entire investment in us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating revenue from any of these non-traditional sources.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation, settlement or licensing costs and expenses.\nThird parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. These intellectual property infringement claims, whether we ultimately are found to be infringing on any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights or not, are time-consuming, costly to defend, and divert resources and management attention away from our other priorities. We have previously been subject to litigation alleging that our products infringed on a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nInfringement claims by third parties also could subject us to significant damage awards or fines or require us to pay large amounts to settle such claims.\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may be required to spend significant resources enforcing these rights or otherwise suffer competitive injury.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to monetize our proprietary technology. We generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and in certain other countries, and upon confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, and partners to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology. Our future and pending patent applications may not be issued with the scope we seek, if at all. In addition, we may not have sufficient capital to continue to prosecute and maintain our existing patents or new or existing patent applications. Others may independently develop similar proprietary technology or otherwise gain access to and disclose our proprietary information and technology, and our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by competitors or others, whether in the United States or in foreign countries. Our employees, customers, or partners also could breach our confidentiality agreements, for which we may not have an adequate remedy available. We also may not be able to timely detect the infringement of our intellectual property rights. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries may not afford the same protection to intellectual property rights as do the laws of the United States. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position.\nDuring fiscal 2012, we notified 11 companies, including Kensington, Targus, Best Buy Co. Inc. (\u201cBest Buy\u201d) and Apple, Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d), that we believed they were manufacturing and distributing products that infringe on one or more of our patents. One of the companies entered into a license agreement with us shortly after being notified of the infringement. Subsequently, in February 2014, Kensington entered into license agreement with us in settlement of time consuming and costly infringement litigation. Also, on March 26, 2016, we entered into a confidential settlement and license agreement with Targus that resolves all claims arising from our litigation with Targus in exchange for a confidential lump sum settlement payment from Targus to us plus per-unit royalty payments to us if Targus exceeds the limit on licensed products that Targus may sell to OEMs under the settlement agreement. In February 2015, we initiated litigation against Best Buy and Apple. The complaint alleges that certain Best Buy power charging products sold in the United States under the Rocketfish brand infringe our patented intellectual property. Best Buy\u2019s supplier Battery Biz filed a petition with the PTAB requesting an Inter Partes Review. Their request was granted. The parties subsequently settled resulting in a dismissal of the action against Best Buy and termination of the Inter Partes Review. In September of 2015, Apple filed a petition with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cPTAB\u201d) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office requesting inter partes review of our U.S. Patent No. 8,492,933 B2 (the \u201c933 Patent\u201d). On February 22, 2017, the PTAB issued its finding, ruling that Apple had shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the claims made by Comarco under the 933 Patent are unpatentable under United States law. To date, we have not taken any formal action against the remaining prior noticed alleged infringers, and at present we are in the process of evaluating if or when we will do so. Whether or not we are successful in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights, litigation is time-consuming and costly, and may result in our intellectual property rights being held invalid or unenforceable. We plan to appeal the PTAB\u2019s ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We estimate that the appeals process will require approximately 12 months to run its course and that we may require incremental financing in order to pursue the appeal to conclusion. We currently have no commitments for any additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain requisite financing on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe cannot be certain of the ultimate costs required to conclude our current litigation and may not be able to continue these proceedings.\nIn February 2015, we filed a lawsuit against Apple for patent infringement under the patent laws of the United States. We are unable to determine the future expenditures related to these matters. The costs incurred for the current litigation may continue to significantly adversely impact our operating results and we may determine that due to the unpredictable nature of the costs and timing of the outcomes, we will no longer be able to pursue these actions.\nOur strategy to license and/or monetize the value of our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property through enforcement actions may not be successful.\nAs noted above, during fiscal 2012, we notified 11 companies, including Kensington, Targus, Best Buy and Apple, that we believe they are manufacturing and/or distributing products that infringe on one or more of our patents. One of the companies entered into a license agreement with us shortly after being notified of the infringement. Subsequently, on February 4, 2014, Kensington entered into a settlement agreement and licensing agreement with us with an effective date of February 1, 2014 that dismissed all claims arising from litigation between us and Kensington. Also, on March 26, 2016, we entered into a confidential settlement and license agreement with Targus that resolves all claims arising from our litigation with Targus in exchange for a confidential lump sum settlement payment from Targus to us plus per-unit royalty payments to us if Targus exceeds the limit on licensed products that Targus may sell to OEMs under the settlement agreement.\nIn February 2015, we initiated separate litigation against both Best Buy and Apple based on our belief that they have manufactured and/or distributed and/or sold products that infringe on one or more of our patents. The complaint alleges that certain Best Buy power charging products sold in the United States under the Rocketfish brand infringe our patented intellectual property. Best Buy\u2019s supplier Battery Biz filed a petition with the PTAB requesting an Inter Partes Review. Their request was granted. The parties subsequently settled resulting in a dismissal of the action against Best Buy and termination of the Inter Partes Review. In September of 2015, Apple filed a petition with the PTAB requesting inter partes review of our 933 Patent. On February 22, 2017, the PTAB issued its finding, ruling that Apple had shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the claims made by us under the 933 Patent are unpatentable under United States law. We cannot predict the ultimate timing, course or outcome of actions taken against the remaining prior noticed infringers and we may not be successful in our efforts to monetize our intellectual property through these enforcement actions.\nA majority of our common stock is held by just a few shareholders, which will make it possible for them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and which influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of other shareholders.\nAs of April 1, 2017, our two largest shareholders owned an aggregate of approximately 60% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Elkhorn Partners Limited Partnership (\u201cElkhorn\u201d) owned approximately 49% and Broadwood Partners, L.P. (\u201cBroadwood\u201d) owned approximately 11%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock at April 1, 2017. These shareholders, and Elkhorn in particular, will have significant influence over all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. In addition, such influence by one or more of these shareholders could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting to purchase us, take us over, and/or reducing the market price offered for our common stock in such an event.\nWe are highly dependent on continuing to receive the services of our CEO and President.\nTom Lanni, who is our Chief Executive Officer and President, has extensive knowledge concerning the technology underlying our patent portfolio as a result of his 20-year tenure with us. The loss of Mr. Lanni\u2019s services could adversely impact our ability to maximize the value of our patent portfolio or otherwise negatively affect our operations.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and, if our operating results decline or are worse than expected, or if our litigation prospects decline materially, our stock price could fall.\nWe do not expect significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue as we have effectively suspended traditional operations. However, as we are now focused on potentially realizing value from our ongoing IP enforcement actions and other litigation as well as exploring further opportunities to expand, protect, and monetize our patent portfolio, including through the potential sale or licensing of some or all of our patent portfolio, our expenses may vary considerably from month to month, which would directly impact our operating results. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many additional reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nOur suspension of historic, traditional business operations, which leaves us with no material, regular revenue sources, and leaves us vulnerable to any short or longer term increases in legal or other expense levels;\n\u25cf\nOur investment in or proceeds from our ongoing and any future litigation;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to obtain settlement proceeds or awards of damages in our patent infringement litigation; and\n\u25cf\nOur ability to sell or license some or all of our patent portfolio.\nDue to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, a certain portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed including operations in support of our administrative expense. If our operating results decline or are below expectations of investors, the market price of our stock may decline significantly.\nWe have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be not effective through January 31, 2017, which could cause deficiencies in our financial reporting and investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and result in a decrease in the value of our securities.\nOur management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\u201d in Item 9A of this report. Specifically, our management has concluded that due to a lack of accounting and information technology staff there is a lack of segregation of duties necessary for an appropriate system of internal controls.\nWhile we will continue to implement our internal controls over financial reporting, because of inherent limitations, our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all material misstatements, errors or omissions. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate. We cannot be certain in future periods that other control deficiencies that may constitute one or more \u201csignificant deficiencies\u201d or \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d (as defined by the relevant auditing standards) in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified. If we fail to implement adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls, our business and results of operations could be harmed, the results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments, we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our securities. Moreover, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions which may discourage attempts by others to acquire or merge with us, which could reduce the market value of our common stock.\nProvisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire or merge with us, which could reduce the market value of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nthe authorization of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by the Board of Directors, without the approval of our shareholders;\n\u25cf\nthe prohibition of action by the written consent of the shareholders;\n\u25cf\nthe establishment of advance notice requirements for director nominations and other proposals by shareholders for consideration at shareholder meetings;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding common stock entitled to vote at a meeting are required to approve certain business combinations with interested shareholders; and\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding common stock entitled to vote at a meeting are required to approve certain changes to specific provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (including those provisions described above).\nOur stock price has been and will likely remain highly volatile.\nThe stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology companies in particular, have experienced fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry stock price fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock. The market price of our stock has exhibited significant price fluctuations, which makes our stock unsuitable for many investors. Our stock price may also be affected by the following factors:\n\u25cf\nOur quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nRealizing value from our ongoing or future litigation as well as the results of our exploring opportunities to expand, protect, and monetize our patent portfolio, including through the potential sale or licensing of some or all of our patent portfolio.\n\u25cf\nOther events affecting other companies that investors deem relevant to us.\nAll of these factors, as well as others not discussed above, may contribute to the volatility of our stock price.\nBecause our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, you may find it difficult to buy or sell or obtain quotations for our common stock\nOur common stock trades under the symbol \u201cCMRO\u201d on the over-the-counter market OTCQB. Because our stock trades in small quantities and trades over-the-counter, rather than on a national securities exchange, you may find it difficult to either economically purchase, sell, or obtain quotations on the price of our common stock.\nSubject to our future financial performance and condition, our Board of Directors may consider voluntarily suspending our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would materially reduce the availability of publicly available information concerning the Company and make it more difficult or impossible for our shareholders to purchase, sell or obtain quotations on the price of our common stock.\nSubject to our future financial performance and condition, our Board of Directors may consider voluntarily suspending our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act as a further cost-cutting measure. If our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act are suspended, it would materially reduce the availability of publicly available information concerning the Company. In addition, upon suspension of our reporting obligations, we would no longer satisfy the requirements for our common stock to be traded on the over-the-counter market OTCQB. It is possible that other trading avenues, such as the OTC Pink Marketplace, may be available for parties interested in trading in our common stock. However, there can be no assurance that any broker-dealer would make or continue to make a market in our common stock, which would be required for trading on the Pink Sheets. Accordingly, our shareholders\u2019 ability to effectuate trades in our common stock following a suspension of our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act would likely to be materially adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions, which could make it difficult for shareholders to sell their shares of our common stock.\nSEC regulations generally define \u201cpenny stocks\u201d as equity securities that have a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If we do not fall within any exemptions from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d definition, we will be subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which regulations are commonly referred to as the \u201cPenny Stock Rules.\u201d The Penny Stock Rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers prior to selling penny stocks, which may make it burdensome to conduct transactions involving our shares. If our shares are subject to the Penny Stock Rules, it may be difficult to buy or sell shares of our stock, and because it may be difficult to find quotations for shares of our stock, it may be impossible to accurately price an investment in our shares. In addition to the Penny Stock Rules, as an issuer of \u201cpenny stock\u201d we are unable to utilize the safe harbor provisions of the Forward Looking Statements sections of the Exchange Act. There can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for an exemption from the Penny Stock Rules, or that if an exemption currently exists, that we will continue to qualify for such exemption. In any event, we are subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of a penny stock if the SEC determines that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, sales practice requirements may also limit a shareholder's ability to buy or sell our common stock.\nIn addition to the Penny Stock Rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.", "PERMNO": 24951, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "CMRO"}
