RISK FACTORS\nThis Form 10-K and the information we are incorporating by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including information regarding our financial outlook, future plans, objectives, business prospects, products and services, trends and anticipated financial performance including with respect to: the timing and expected completion and impact of the proposed merger with United Technologies Corporation (UTC); our revenue; our liquidity and capital resources; our bookings and backlog; our international sales, including our ability to do business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and future delays in the Congressional Notification process and/or other potential challenges related to sales to certain foreign customers; cybersecurity sales; our pension, other postretirement benefit (PRB), nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans expense and funding; our recognition of revenue on certain performance obligations; our expectations regarding customer demand and contracts; seasonality of our business; our capital expenditures; our amortization expense; the impact of new accounting pronouncements and tax regulations; our expected tax payments; our unrecognized tax benefits; our reclassifications of gains or losses on cash flow hedges; the impact of acquisitions, investments and other business arrangements and the tax deductibility of goodwill; the impact and outcome of audits and legal and administrative proceedings, claims, investigations, commitments and contingencies; the impact of certain regional developments; delays and disruptions in delivery of materials and services from suppliers; the impact of changes in fair value of our reporting units; delays and disruption in delivery of materials and services from Turkish suppliers; the impact of changes in foreign currency rates; the impact of Brexit; the impact of competition; growth in our cyber business; as well as information regarding domestic and international defense spending, budgets and business practices. You can identify these statements by the fact that they include words such as \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d or variations of these words, or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts and represent only our current expectations regarding such matters. These statements inherently involve a wide range of known and unknown uncertainties. Our actual actions and results could differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these statements. Specific factors that could cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those set forth below and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Given these factors, as well as other variables that may affect our operating results, you should not rely on forward-looking statements, assume that past financial performance will be a reliable indicator of future performance, or use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. We expressly disclaim any obligation or intention to provide updates to the forward-looking statements and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, except as required by law.\nWe depend on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in U.S. government defense spending and priorities could impact our financial position, results of operations and overall business.\nIn 2019, U.S. government sales, excluding foreign military sales, accounted for approximately 69% of our total net sales. Our U.S. government revenues largely result from contracts awarded under various U.S. government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and a broad range of programs with the U.S. Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. Our programs are subject to U.S. government policies, budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including: (1) geopolitical events; (2) macroeconomic conditions; and (3) the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills.\nIn recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) established specific limits on annual appropriations for fiscal years (FY) 2012-2021, but was amended a number of times leading to fluctuations and unpredictability in annual DoD funding levels. As compared to the relevant preceding year, the DoD budget fell in FY 2013, remained essentially flat for FY 2014 and 2015, and increased each year from FY 2016 to 2020. BCA caps were raised for FY 2021 from their original level, and FY 2021 DoD funding is expected to be similar to FY 2020. Further, the DoD budget requires the agreement and action of both Congress and the President. In addition, in previous years the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both governmental shut-downs and Continuing Resolutions (CRs) providing only enough funds for U.S. government agencies to continue operating at prior year levels. Further, if the U.S. government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its debts.\nAs a result, U.S. government defense spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes and are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future governmental priorities and the state of governmental finances. Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur financial results largely are dependent on our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding and timing, as well as termination. Our financial results could also be affected by performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages, or definitization delays in connection with these contracts, as well as by the mix of our contracts and programs.\nOur financial results largely are dependent on our performance under our U.S. government contracts. Although we have thousands of U.S. government contracts, the termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages, or contract definitization delays could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nU.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. government\u2019s convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor on some contracts. In these arrangements, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. Further, we can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination of any of our contracts.\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations, which are made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. In addition, regular appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer\u2019s desired delivery dates or other requirements but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program.\nOur U.S. government contracts typically involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. New technologies may be untested or unproven and in some instances, product requirements or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. With the U.S. government\u2019s greater focus on new technologies, such as interceptors, space-based sensors, high-energy lasers, hypersonics, and counter-hypersonics, we have more development programs. Our failure to execute effectively on these programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investment amounts may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for new contract awards.\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts represent approximately 65% of our backlog, and are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated cost ceiling. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the cost ceiling amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations. Contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost reimbursable, but can be FFP or FPI. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated.\nOver the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards research and development work without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract cost sharing (e.g., one-third of program costs). They may also require non-traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. For example, we were awarded an OTA contract for the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) in late 2019. If we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements, it could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nDue to the nature of our work under many of our U.S. government contracts, we may experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. Some of our U.S. government contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts it could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations, which are discussed in more detail below.\nFrom time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract award with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability.\nIn addition, we are involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. government which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes and claims.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop new offerings and technologies for our current and future markets.\nTo continue achievement of our growth strategy, we must successfully develop new offerings and technologies or adapt existing offerings and technologies for our current and future markets including new international, civil, and commercial markets. Accordingly, our future performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability in current, emerging and future growth markets to:\n-\nIdentify market needs and growth opportunities;\n-\nIdentify emerging technological and other trends;\n-\nIdentify additional uses for our existing technology to address customer needs;\n-\nDevelop and maintain competitive products and services at competitive prices;\n-\nEnhance our offerings by adding innovative features that differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors;\n-\nDevelop, manufacture and bring solutions to market quickly at cost-effective prices;\n-\nEnhance product designs for export and releasability to international markets; and\n-\nEffectively structure our businesses to reflect the competitive environment including through the use of joint ventures, collaborative agreements and other forms of alliances.\nWe believe that in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to invest significant financial resources to develop new, and adapt existing, offerings and technologies. We fund this investment through customer funded and internal research and development, acquisitions and joint ventures or other teaming arrangements. We believe this investment is needed to meet demands and expand in our domestic and international markets, including emerging opportunities within the DoD market and the commercial cybersecurity market in which our Forcepoint business segment competes. Our investments to develop new offerings and technologies, or adapt existing offerings and technologies, could divert our attention and resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot be sure that these investments will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies or identification of and expansion into new or growth markets.\nDue to the design complexity of our products, we may experience future delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or deflect resources from other projects. These risks are heightened by recent increases in new development programs. Further, our competitors may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products. In addition, there can be no assurance that: (1) the market for our offerings will develop or continue to expand; (2) we will be successful in newly identified markets as we currently anticipate; or (3) the acquisitions, joint ventures or other teaming arrangements we may enter into in pursuit of developing new offerings and technologies will be successful. The failure of our technology to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our business.\nOur existing technology and offerings may become obsolete due to new competitive technology or offerings. If we fail in our new product development efforts or our products or services fail to achieve market acceptance faster than our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nCompetition within our markets may reduce our revenues and market share and limit our future market opportunities.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. We anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against us in our core markets as a result of continued domestic and cross-border defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitors\u2019 capabilities throughout the supply chain through vertical integration. We are also facing heightened competition in our domestic and international markets from foreign and multinational firms. In addition, as discussed in more detail above, U.S. defense spending and U.S. government procurement strategies may limit our future market opportunities. For example, the DoD continues to award contracts through competitive bidding. Highly competitive pricing, in which a bidder may anticipate making a substantial investment in a program in order to win the work, has been seen in certain cases. In addition, bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards are more frequent. Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a re-bid of the contract. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other support work.\nIn addition, the U.S. government has been awarding more development programs due to changing U.S. government priorities. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core markets, we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition, our Forcepoint cybersecurity business segment faces significant competition due to rapid changes in technology, products, customer specifications and industry standards. It also has a wide range of market competitors, some that are significantly larger with broader product and service offerings or have best-of-breed products and/or maintain stronger customer relationships. In order to compete effectively, Forcepoint must successfully execute on its growth strategy, including the development of new products and services. If Forcepoint is unable to compete successfully, it may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise benefit our other operations.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to extensive procurement rules and regulations. Changes in rules, regulations and business practices could negatively affect current programs and potential awards. Our business could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with any procurement rules and regulations.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements including: (1) export-import control; (2) security; (3) contract pricing and cost; (4) contract termination and adjustment; and (5) audit and product integrity requirements. These requirements impact our performance and compliance costs. In addition, the U.S. government has and may continue to implement initiatives focused on efficiencies, affordability and cost growth and other changes to its procurement practices which may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. This could also affect whether we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to pursue them.\nFor example, in recent years the DoD has increasingly included contractual payment and cost reimbursement terms such as incentive-based contracts that require contractors to share cost overruns and underruns with the U.S. government.\nIn addition, failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could result in: (1) reductions in contract value; (2) contract modifications or termination; (3) cash withholds on contract payments; (4) forfeiture of profits; and (5) the assessment of civil and criminal penalties and fines. Any of these could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to: (1) procurement integrity; (2) export control; (3) U.S. government security regulations; (4) employment practices; (5) protection of the environment; (6) accuracy of records and the recording of costs; and (7) foreign corruption. Penalties or sanctions resulting from any failure to comply with applicable requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. This could also have a negative impact on our reputation, lead to contract terminations and reduce our ability to procure other U.S. government contracts in the future.\nIssues with component availability, subcontractor performance or key supplier performance may affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products and services.\nWe depend on our suppliers delivering materials, and on our subcontractors assembling major components and subsystems for our products in a timely and satisfactory manner and in full compliance with applicable terms and conditions. We are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials we use which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. These procurement rules include requirements for genuine original equipment manufacturer parts. As we continue to seek further cost efficiencies throughout our business, we may centralize procurements in order to attain better pricing through strategic sourcing, which may increase our dependency on certain suppliers. In some instances, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers. In recent years, our supplier pool has become further limited in some areas due to consolidation and supplier business closures.\nIn addition, our suppliers may experience materials or components shortages. In recent times, the industry has experienced shortages of certain microelectronic components. Tariffs currently imposed on certain materials and other trade issues may create or exacerbate existing materials shortages and drive-up material prices. These developments may also result in further supplier business closures. Some products require relatively scarce raw materials, including some which are largely controlled by a single country, and the ability to source those materials is dependent on U.S. relations with the country. Materials or\ncomponents sourced from a particular country may become subject to sanctions or other bans imposed by the United States or other countries. In addition, some of our suppliers or subcontractors may be susceptible to changes in global economic conditions that could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nIf certain component materials are not available or if any of our suppliers or subcontractors otherwise fails to meet our needs or becomes insolvent, we may not have readily available alternatives or alternatives at prices that meet the demands of our customers. We enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and take other actions, such as accelerating supplier payments commensurate with value delivered, to ensure the financial viability of our suppliers and the availability of needed materials, components and subsystems. However, we cannot be sure that such items will be available at all or in the needed quantities. In addition, we require our suppliers to deliver components and services that are free from viruses and malicious code that may damage or destroy such components and interrupt such services, and include in our contracts with our suppliers the DoD requirements mandating the reporting of breaches to information technology systems containing critical government information. If we experience a material supplier or subcontractor problem, it could negatively impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our customer obligations. This could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts and damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers. We could also incur additional costs in addressing this type of problem. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, we must conduct diligence and provide disclosure regarding the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, which may impact our procurement practices and increase our costs.\nOur international business is subject to geopolitical and economic factors, regulatory requirements and other risks.\nOur international business exposes us to geopolitical and economic factors, regulatory requirements, increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers. These risks differ from and may be greater than those associated with our domestic business. In 2019, our sales to customers outside the U.S. (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government) accounted for 29% of our total net sales. Our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate. Any significant impairment of our ability to conduct business outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur international business is sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by: (1) changes in threat environments; (2) geopolitical uncertainties; (3) volatility in worldwide economic conditions; and (4) various regional and local economic and political factors, including volatility in energy prices, changes in U.S. foreign policy, changes in existing free trade laws and regulations and other risks and uncertainties. Our international sales are subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other anti-corruption, sanctions, and export laws and regulations. Any failure by us or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal, civil or administrative penalties including fines, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our ability to export our products.\nIn addition, due to the nature of our products, we must obtain licenses and authorizations from various U.S. government agencies before selling our products outside of the U.S. Our ability to obtain these licenses and authorizations timely or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. government policies or laws or delays in Congressional action due to geopolitical and other factors. Some of our direct commercial sale contracts with international customers have requirements relating to these licenses and authorizations and may permit the customer to terminate the contract if we fail to receive these approvals in a timely manner. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be reversed, prevented or delayed. In the recent past, we had several direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with certain Middle Eastern customers for which U.S. government approvals had been delayed until the Administration directly approved these sales. At December 31, 2019, we had pending $1.2 billion of total contract value of these contracts that require U.S. government approvals. Additionally, one of those contracts, which has a contract value of $835 million, also requires U.K. government approval. In addition, new sales to these customers may face similar delays and/or potential challenges given the geopolitical issues.\nCertain events have caused increased attention on U.S. defense sales to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Although we currently do not expect to be prevented from doing business in KSA, which represents less than 5% of our sales, if government\naction impairs our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations or otherwise to continue to do business in KSA, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur international sales are also subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices which may differ from U.S. government requirements. These include regulations relating to export-import control, technology transfer, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Further, our international sales contracts may be subject to non-U.S. contract laws and regulations and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted differently under foreign laws. Delays, cost overruns and product failures, or technological or other difficulties could also affect our ability to perform on our international contracts and negatively affect our profitability. In addition, these contracts may be subject to termination for default based on performance or failure to obtain U.S. government export approvals. These contracts may also be subject to termination at the customer\u2019s convenience, and may be subject to funding risks. In connection with our international business, we also operate subsidiaries domiciled in non-U.S. locations that are subject to local government laws and regulations which may differ from U.S. government requirements. In addition, the timing of orders, customer negotiations, governmental approvals and notifications from our international customers can be less predictable than from our domestic customers. This may lead to variations in international bookings and sales each year.\nWe must also manage a certain degree of exposure to the risk of currency fluctuations. Our international sales in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately $1.4 billion in both 2019 and 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2017, the majority of which were in British pounds and Australian dollars with the remainder primarily in euros and Canadian dollars. See \u201cNote 16: Business Segment Reporting\u201d within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for total net sales and property, plant and equipment by geographical area.\nOur international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans, marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies.\nOur international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements or financial support obligations, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements. Approvals of offset or ICIP thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay contract awards. Offset requirements may, in certain countries, include the creation of a joint venture with a local company which may control the venture. This could result in liability for violations of law for actions taken by these entities, including laws related to anti-corruption, sanctions, export, or local laws which may differ from U.S. laws and requirements. In addition, the ability to recover investments that we make may be dependent upon the success of ventures that we do not control. Such offset obligations are generally multi-year arrangements and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. In addition, certain customers\u2019 demands are increasing for greater offset or ICIP commitment levels, higher-value content, including the transfer of technologies and capabilities, and local production and economic development. We also are exposed to risks associated with using third-party foreign representatives and consultants for international sales, and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers in connection with international programs. As a result of the above factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected, and we could incur losses on these programs which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract, train and retain such personnel and to maintain our corporate culture and high ethical standards could seriously harm our business.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key technical personnel and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Our continued growth increases the need for qualified personnel. Competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, training or retaining qualified personnel with the requisite skills or security clearances. In addition, certain personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed, which may impact our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts. Further, a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel and successfully\nmanage the transfer of critical knowledge. We face competition in attracting new qualified personnel, especially in a low unemployment environment. In addition, new qualified personnel may have different expectations from our current workforce, which could result in difficulties attracting and retaining new employees. Loss of key employees, failure to attract new qualified employees or adequately train them, delays in receiving required security clearances, or delays in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe believe that a critical component of our ability to successfully attract, train and retain qualified personnel has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, collaboration and a focus on execution, all in an environment of high ethical standards. Our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract, train and retain essential qualified personnel who are vital to our business. Further, we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards. To the extent any of our leaders were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values, we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber attacks, other security breaches and other disruptions.\nWe routinely experience cyber and other security threats including: threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary, sensitive or classified information, and attempts to infiltrate our products and services and sabotage or disable their use by our customers. We also encounter threats to our physical security, including our facilities and personnel, and threats from terrorism or similar acts. In addition, our business could be disrupted by natural disasters, including the impacts of climate change.\nAs a defense contractor that protects national security information, we are the target of advanced and persistent cyber attacks from a variety of assailants, including nation states, in addition to attacks similar to those encountered in other industries. Our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely experience similar security threats. Cybersecurity threats include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to access information, online extortion attempts, disruption or denial of service attacks, insider threat attacks, and other cybersecurity events that could lead to disruptions of our systems or unauthorized access to our data. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. In addition, in some cases we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats. Cyber attacks could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personal, other protected information (which may belong to us, our employees, or third parties) or national security information, and corruption of data, networks or systems. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures and controls and have invested in significant resources to appropriately identify and monitor these threats and mitigate potential risks, including risks involving our customers and suppliers. However, due to their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in preventing or defending against all cyber attacks and preventing or mitigating associated losses. In addition, because cybersecurity and related data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, our compliance costs could increase.\nIn addition, we provide cybersecurity, defense and other products and services to government and commercial customers, as well as products in which cybersecurity capabilities are embedded. As a result, these products and services are subject to attacks targeting their security, integrity and/or availability. Our cybersecurity products and services ultimately may not be able to effectively detect, prevent, or protect against cyber attacks or otherwise mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In addition, some products and services that we provide to customers, particularly those related to public security, may raise potential liabilities related to privacy and intellectual property.\nThe impact of a future cyber incident cannot be predicted, particularly because these threats evolve quickly, their seriousness and scale vary widely, and national security information or other sensitive government functions may be involved. The impact of other business disruptions, such as those related to our physical security or resulting from natural disasters or other events, is also difficult to predict. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. We maintain internal controls and procedures on cybersecurity incident prevention, detection, mitigation, response, recovery and disclosure. However, we may be unsuccessful in detecting, reporting or responding to these events adequately in a timely manner. Cyber attacks, security breaches, and other events could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties, and cause harm to facilities or personnel. They could require significant management attention and resources and could result in the loss of business,\nregulatory actions and potential liability. They could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public. Any one of these outcomes could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a negative audit or investigatory finding by the U.S. government.\nWe are subject to audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the DoD and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Congressional Committees, in large part because we are a government contractor. From time to time, these and other agencies conduct investigations or audits to determine whether our operations are in compliance with applicable requirements. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government. In some cases, the DOJ has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against us, we could suffer serious reputational harm which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\nAccounting for long-term contracts requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements. Due to the size and long-term nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (including estimates of award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complexity of the work to be performed; (3) the availability of materials; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) execution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; and (7) overhead cost rates, among other variables. Because of the significance of management\u2019s judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nFor a detailed discussion of how our financial statements can be affected by contract accounting policies, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nSignificant changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates and assumed long-term return on plan assets (ROA), as well as our actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our earnings, equity and pension contributions in future periods.\nWe must determine our pension and PRB plans\u2019 expense or income which involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to our discount rate, long-term ROA and other actuarial assumptions. The discount rate assumption is set annually and we determine on an annual basis whether it is appropriate to change our long-term ROA assumption. These assumptions and other actuarial assumptions may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions could result in negative changes to our pension and PRB plans\u2019 expense and funded status, and our cash contributions to such plans, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, differences between our actual investment returns and our long-term ROA assumption would result in a change to our pension and PRB plans\u2019 expense and funded status and our required contributions to the plans. They may also be impacted by changes in regulatory, accounting and other requirements applicable to pensions.\nFor a detailed discussion of how our financial statements can be affected by pension and PRB plan accounting policies, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nIf we fail to manage our acquisitions, investments, divestitures, joint ventures and other transactions successfully, these activities could adversely affect our future financial results.\nIn pursuing our business strategies, we continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other teaming and collaborative arrangements. We undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base, as well as expand our offerings and market reach into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities. In evaluating such transactions, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Further, these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including: (1) the risks involved with entering new markets; (2) the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements; (3) challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; (4) unidentified issues not discovered in Raytheon\u2019s due diligence; (5) the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives; (6) the potential impairment of acquired assets; (7) the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies; and (8) the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses. In addition, future transactions may impact our deployment of capital, including dividends, stock repurchases, pension contributions, and investments.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets, and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $15.4 billion which represented 45% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. In the event of an impairment any excess goodwill must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business which will require us to record goodwill and intangible assets based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an impairment evaluation. Future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor a detailed discussion of how our financial statements can be affected by goodwill accounting policies, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nThe outcome of litigation in which we have been named, or may in the future be named, as a defendant is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are the defendant in a number of litigation matters and are subject to various other claims, demands and investigations. In addition, we may be subject to future litigation matters, claims, demands and investigations. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims, demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or obtain certain rights in third party intellectual property on reasonable terms, which could affect our ability to compete.\nOur efforts to gain awards of contracts and ensure a competitive position in the market depends in part on our ability to ensure that our intellectual property is protected, that our intellectual property rights are not diluted or subject to misuse, and that we are able to license certain third party intellectual property on reasonable terms. We own many U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, and have rights in unpatented inventions, know-how, data, software, trademarks and copyrights. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses under certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in performance of government contracts. Governments may use or authorize others (including our competitors) to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes. Governments may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights, which could reduce our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to compete. There can be no assurance that any\nof our patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or circumvented by third parties. In addition, the laws concerning intellectual property vary among nations and the protection provided to our intellectual property by the laws and courts of foreign nations may differ from those of the U.S. Further, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights can be costly, and even if successful, can distract our attention from other areas of our business. All of the above could diminish the value of our intellectual property, affecting our ability to procure future business or maximize the use of our intellectual property to increase our revenue.\nIn some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. Intellectual property obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. In addition, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. In other instances, our ability to procure and perform government contracts requires us to obtain certain rights in the intellectual property of others through government grants. Governments may deny us the right to obtain such rights in the intellectual property of others which may affect our ability to perform government contracts.\nThe confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements we enter into with our employees and non-disclosure obligations and agreements we enter into with our suppliers, consultants and appropriate customers may not adequately protect our proprietary information, deter misappropriation and misuse of our proprietary information, or prevent third-party development of similar technologies, all of which may negatively impact our ability to compete. We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, use our intellectual property for a competitive advantage, or continue to access licensed intellectual property of third parties, any of which could have a negative impact on our ability to win and perform on contracts, our reputation, and our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\nWe use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and, in some cases, have in the past been named as a defendant in related \u201ctoxic tort\u201d claims.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that: (1) impose requirements for the proper management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\nA criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility.\nIn addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance.\nA significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the SAFETY\nAct provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The amount of the insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products and services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It could also affect the cost and availability of available insurance in the future.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Further, changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with UTC\nThe Merger is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Merger could have material adverse effects on Raytheon.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the receipt of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) private letter ruling regarding certain tax matters and certain tax-related opinions and solvency opinions from outside legal counsel, the completion by UTC of the Separation and the Distributions, and a certain amount of net indebtedness of UTC following the Separation and the Distributions (UTC RemainCo), which make the completion and timing of the Merger uncertain.\nThe failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed.\nIf the Merger is not completed, Raytheon may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n-\nthe market price of Raytheon common stock could decline;\n-\nRaytheon could owe a substantial termination fee to UTC in specified circumstances;\n-\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Raytheon Board of Directors seeks another business combination, Raytheon stockholders cannot be certain that Raytheon will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that UTC has agreed to in the Merger Agreement;\n-\ntime and resources, financial and other, committed by Raytheon\u2019s management to matters relating to the Merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n-\nRaytheon may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from its customers, suppliers or employees; and\n-\nRaytheon will be required to pay its costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the Merger is completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, Raytheon could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against Raytheon to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Any of these risks could materially and adversely impact Raytheon\u2019s ongoing business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nSimilarly, delays in the completion of the Merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the Merger, and could materially\nand adversely impact the ongoing business, financial condition, financial results and stock price of Raytheon prior to the Merger and UTC following completion of the Merger (the Combined Company).\nThe Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from several regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Raytheon or the Combined Company or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Merger.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (HSR Act) relating to the completion of the Merger must have expired or been terminated and any authorization or consent from a governmental authority required to be obtained with respect to the Merger under certain other applicable foreign regulatory laws must have been obtained. In deciding whether to grant the required regulatory authorization or consent, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the Merger within their relevant jurisdiction, including, among other things, the impact on the parties\u2019 respective customers and suppliers and the applicable defense ministry and the impact of the parties\u2019 foreign investment in the jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the Combined Company\u2019s business or may materially delay the completion of the Merger.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, UTC and Raytheon have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorizations and consents, and each of UTC and Raytheon has agreed to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust laws that may be asserted by any governmental authority so as to enable the completion of the Merger as promptly as practicable. However, UTC\u2019s and Raytheon\u2019s obligations to take such actions are subject to limitations, including that neither UTC nor Raytheon will be required to commit to or effect any sale, divestiture, lease, holding separate pending a sale or other transfer or disposal, or certain other restrictions or actions if such actions, in the aggregate would or would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse impact on Raytheon, UTC or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case measured on a scale relative to the size of the Combined Company.\nIn addition, at any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods, the applicable U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities or any state attorney general could take such action under antitrust or applicable foreign investment laws as such party deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include, among other things, seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. In addition, in some circumstances, a third party could initiate a private action challenging, seeking to enjoin, or seeking to impose conditions on the Merger. UTC and Raytheon may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any such action.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement relating to applicable regulatory laws will be satisfied.\nThe exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either UTC\u2019s or Raytheon\u2019s stock price; there is no (and will not be until the completion of the Distributions) trading history with respect to the shares of the UTC aerospace businesses on a standalone basis after giving effect to the Separation and the Distributions.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Raytheon common stock (other than excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger consideration, which is equal to 2.3348 fully paid and nonassessable shares of UTC common stock (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares). This exchange ratio was fixed in the Merger Agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either UTC common stock or Raytheon common stock.\nAs of the date of this filing, it is impossible to accurately predict the market price of UTC common stock at the completion of the Merger (including as a result of, among other things, the Separation and the Distributions), and therefore, impossible to accurately predict the market value of the shares of UTC common stock that Raytheon stockholders will receive in the Merger. There is no (and will not be until the completion of the Distributions) trading history with respect to the shares of the UTC aerospace businesses on a standalone basis after giving effect to the Separation and the Distributions. The market price for UTC common stock may fluctuate both prior to the completion of the Merger and thereafter for a variety of reasons, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the demand for UTC\u2019s or Raytheon\u2019s products and services, the Separation and the Distributions, changes in laws and regulations, other changes in UTC\u2019s and Raytheon\u2019s respective businesses, operations, prospects and financial results of operations, market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will\nbe completed, and the expected timing of the Merger. Many of these factors are beyond UTC\u2019s and Raytheon\u2019s control. As a result, the market value represented by the exchange ratio will also vary.\nAs a result of the Distributions, we expect the market price of shares of UTC common stock to decline because the market price will no longer include the value of the Otis business or the Carrier business. The value of UTC common stock that Raytheon stockholders will receive in the Merger will reflect the combination of the UTC aerospace businesses and Raytheon and will not include the value of the Otis business or the Carrier business as the market price of UTC common stock currently does. We cannot predict the amount of this decline, as the market price of shares of UTC common stock may fluctuate based on the perceived values of the common stock of UTC, the Otis business and the Carrier business in anticipation of the Distributions and the Merger, and it may not be possible to estimate the market value of UTC common stock. In addition, there is no (and will not be until the completion of the Distributions) trading history with respect to the shares of the UTC aerospace businesses on a standalone basis after giving effect to the Separation and Distributions. Therefore, current and historical market prices of UTC common stock are not reflective of the value that Raytheon stockholders will receive in the Merger.\nEach party is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect Raytheon\u2019s, and, following completion of the Merger, the Combined Company\u2019s business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom UTC and/or Raytheon has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with UTC or Raytheon, as the case may be, as a result of the Merger or otherwise, which could negatively affect UTC\u2019s or Raytheon\u2019s respective revenues, earnings and/or cash flows, as well as the market price of UTC common stock or Raytheon common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of UTC and Raytheon is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger that may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness, pay dividends, incur capital expenditures or settle claims. Such limitations could adversely affect each of UTC\u2019s and Raytheon\u2019s business and operations prior to the completion of the Merger.\nEach of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Merger.\nCompletion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain customer and other agreements to which UTC or Raytheon is a party, which may have an adverse impact on the Combined Company\u2019s business and results of operations following completion of the Merger.\nThe completion of the Merger may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which UTC or Raytheon is a party. If UTC or Raytheon is unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, including terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages or equitable remedies. Even if UTC and Raytheon are able to negotiate consents or waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to UTC or Raytheon. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the Combined Company\u2019s business and results of operations following completion of the Merger.\nUncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the Combined Company following completion of the Merger.\nUTC and Raytheon are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The Combined Company\u2019s success after the completion of the Merger will depend in part upon the ability of the Combined Company to retain certain key management personnel and employees of UTC and Raytheon. Prior to the completion of the Merger (as well as the Separations and the Distributions), current and prospective employees of UTC and Raytheon may experience uncertainty about their roles following the completion of the transactions, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of UTC and Raytheon to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Furthermore, UTC expects certain key members of its current management will become employees of the entities holding the\nOtis business and the Carrier business and therefore such persons will no longer be employed by UTC. In addition, no assurance can be given that the Combined Company, after the completion of the Merger, will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees to the same extent that UTC and Raytheon have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees.\nIf either of the Distributions, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of UTC (including pursuant to the Merger), the Combined Company could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nIt is a condition to the Distributions and the Merger that UTC receive (1) a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and the Distributions and (2) an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of each of the Distributions under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Further, it is a condition to each of UTC\u2019s and Raytheon\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger that each of UTC and Raytheon receive an opinion of its respective outside counsel to the effect that (a) the Merger will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) the Merger will not cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to either of the Distributions.\nNotwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel regarding the Distributions, the IRS could determine that the Distributions and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinions of counsel was based are inaccurate or have not been complied with. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling will not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether each of the Distributions, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by UTC of the IRS private letter ruling and receipt by UTC and Raytheon of opinions of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distributions and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including by reason of the Merger) or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, the Combined Company could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.\nRisks Related to the Combined Company\nFollowing the Merger, the composition of the board of directors of the Combined Company will be different than the composition of the current Raytheon Board of Directors.\nThe Raytheon Board of Directors currently consists of 13 directors. Upon completion of the Merger, the board of directors of the Combined Company will consist of 15 directors, including seven independent directors designated by UTC, six independent directors designated by Raytheon and the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman of the Combined Company.\nThe Combined Company may be unable to successfully integrate the UTC aerospace businesses and Raytheon and realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the Combined Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the UTC aerospace businesses and Raytheon, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities and operational efficiencies from the Merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers. If the Combined Company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of the Combined Company common stock may decline. The Combined Company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected.\nThe integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n-\nmanaging a larger, more complex combined aerospace and defense business;\n-\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n-\nretaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the Merger, and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n-\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention as a result of the devoting attention to the Merger, and/or the Separation and the Distributions;\n-\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n-\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n-\nunforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger, including the Separation and the Distributions.\nMany of these factors will be outside of UTC\u2019s and/or Raytheon\u2019s control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect the Combined Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, UTC completed its Merger with Rockwell Collins on November 26, 2018, and the integration of the UTC aerospace businesses and Rockwell Collins remains in process. This ongoing integration may increase the complexity of, and challenges associated with, the integration of the UTC aerospace businesses and Raytheon, which may make it more difficult for UTC and Raytheon to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger fully or at all, or within the anticipated time frame.\nDue to legal restrictions, UTC and Raytheon are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the Merger. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe Combined Company may not be able to engage in desirable capital-raising or strategic transactions following the Merger.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a spin-off that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the parent corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Distributions, the Combined Company may be limited in its ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases, or other transactions that it may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Raytheon stockholders will have different rights under the Combined Company\u2019s governing documents than they do currently under Raytheon\u2019s governing documents.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Raytheon stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Raytheon, but will instead become stockholders of the Combined Company and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the terms of the Combined Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws. The terms of the Combined Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws will be in some respects different than the terms of Raytheon\u2019s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which currently govern the rights of Raytheon stockholders.\nThe Combined Company\u2019s amended and restated by-laws will designate the state courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by Combined Company stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Combined Company and its directors, officers and employees.\nUnder the Combined Company\u2019s amended and restated by-laws, unless the Combined Company determines otherwise, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n-\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Combined Company;\n-\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Combined Company to the Combined Company or to Combined Company stockholders;\n-\nany action asserting a claim against the Combined Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Combined Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Combined Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated by-laws (as either may be amended from time to time); or\n-\nany action asserting a claim against the Combined Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Combined Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), although Combined Company stockholders will not be deemed to have waived the Combined Company\u2019s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of Combined Company stockholders to commence litigation in a forum that they prefer, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Combined Company and its current or former directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, the Combined Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe future results of the Combined Company may be adversely impacted if the Combined Company does not effectively manage its complex operations following the completion of the Merger.\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, the size of the Combined Company\u2019s aerospace and defense business will be significantly larger than the current size of either Raytheon\u2019s business or the UTC aerospace businesses, while at the same time the Otis business and Carrier business will no longer be part of UTC. The Combined Company\u2019s ability to successfully manage this expanded aerospace and defense business while having completed the Distributions will depend, in part, upon management\u2019s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of the UTC aerospace businesses and Raytheon, including UTC\u2019s continuing integration of the Rockwell Collins business, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity, and the loss of certain scale and scope through the Distributions. There can be no assurances that the Combined Company will be successful in integrating the businesses or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nEach of UTC and Raytheon expects to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Merger and the integration of the UTC aerospace businesses and Raytheon.\nEach of UTC and Raytheon will incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the Merger (including, in the case of UTC, with respect to the Separation and the Distributions) to integrate a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of UTC and Raytheon in connection with the Merger. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses related to the transactions and facilities and systems consolidation costs. The Combined Company may incur additional costs or suffer loss of business under third-party contracts that are terminated or that contain change in control or other provisions that may be triggered by the completion of the transactions, and/or losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers, and may also incur costs to retain certain key management personnel and employees. UTC and Raytheon will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the Combined Company, and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. These incremental transaction-related costs may exceed the savings the Combined Company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs. Factors beyond the parties\u2019 control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.\nThe market price of the Combined Company\u2019s common stock after the Merger is completed may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of UTC common stock or Raytheon common stock before the Merger is completed.\nUpon completion of the Merger, holders of Raytheon common stock will be holders of common stock of the Combined Company. As the businesses of UTC and Raytheon are different, the results of operations as well as the price of the Combined Company common stock may, in the future, be affected by factors different from those factors affecting each of UTC and Raytheon as an independent stand-alone company. The Combined Company will face additional risks and uncertainties to which each UTC and Raytheon may currently not be exposed. As a result, the market price of the Combined Company\u2019s shares may fluctuate significantly following completion of the Merger. Additionally, as a result of the Distributions, the market price of shares of the Combined Company\u2019s common stock will generally not be affected by factors relating to the Otis business or the Carrier business.\nThe market price of the Combined Company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the Merger, including as a result of some UTC and/or Raytheon stockholders adjusting their portfolios.\nThe market price of the Combined Company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the Merger if, among other things, the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of the businesses of the UTC aerospace businesses and Raytheon\u2019s businesses are not realized, there are unanticipated negative impacts on UTC\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows from either of the Distributions, or if the transaction costs related to the Merger are greater than expected. The market price also may decline if the Combined Company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger (including the Separation and the Distributions) as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the transactions on the Combined Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nIn addition, sales of the Combined Company\u2019s common stock after the completion of the transactions may cause the market price of such common stock to decrease. It is estimated that UTC will issue approximately 648 million shares, including share equity awards, of UTC common stock in connection with the Merger, based on the number of outstanding shares, including share equity awards, of Raytheon common stock as of July 11, 2019. Raytheon stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of Combined Company common stock they will receive in the Merger. Certain Raytheon stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of Combined Company common stock that they receive in the Merger. UTC stockholders may decide not to continue to hold their shares of common stock following completion of the Merger and/or the Separation and the Distributions. Certain UTC stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell their shares of common stock following completion of the transactions. Such sales of Combined Company common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for the Combined Company\u2019s common stock.\nAny of these events may make it more difficult for the Combined Company to sell equity or equity-related securities, dilute your ownership interest in the Combined Company and have an adverse impact on the price of the Combined Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 85658, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "RTN"}
