{"cik": "1591890", "company": "1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not have future opportunities to participate in take-out programs.\nFrom 2012 to 2017, we have obtained policies from the annual LA Citizens take-outs occurring on December 1st of each year, from which we have approximately 9,900 policies in-force, representing approximately 14% of our total direct and assumed policies as of December 31, 2018. Furthermore, we participated in FL Citizens depopulations in 2017 and 2018, as well as the inaugural take-out of policies from TWIA on December 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2018 we have assumed approximately 6,900 and 630 policies for the coverages of wind and hail only from FL Citizens and TWIA, respectively. During the pendency of the Asset Sale, and in the event we do not consummate the Asset Sale with FedNat, we may not be able to obtain the quantity or quality of policies currently obtained due to changes in the take-out programs, our inability to meet take-out program participation requirements, or due to changes to the market in general. Furthermore, effective August 2018, the State of Louisiana adopted new law which considerably reduced the number of policies available for assumption from LA Citizens. This resulted in our non-participation in the annual depopulation of policies from LA Citizens in December 2018. Additionally, competitors could change their risk profile characteristics, and write these risks directly, which would cause us to lose these policies. The loss of these policies could impact our ability to absorb fixed expenses with lower volumes in the future.\nA substantial portion of our in-force policies have been assumed from state-run insurers and cover losses arising only from wind and hail, which creates a large concentration of our business in wind and hail only coverage and limits our ability to implement our restrictive underwriting guidelines.\nWhile both LA Citizens and FL Citizens write full peril protection policies in addition to wind and hail only policies, the majority of policies that we have obtained through these insurers\u2019 take-out programs cover losses arising only from wind and hail. Furthermore, the policies which we have assumed from TWIA are wind and hail only policies, as TWIA does not write full peril protection policies. Prior to our take-out, some of these LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA policyholders may not have been able to obtain such coverage from any other marketplace. Approximately 22% of our total direct and assumed policies as of December 31, 2018 represent LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA wind and hail only policies. These exposures may subject us to greater risk from catastrophic events. While our voluntary independent agency program includes various restrictive underwriting strategies, we are unable to implement these strategies to the wind and hail only policies that are taken-out from LA Citizens and FL Citizens and TWIA. Pursuant to these depopulation programs, we must offer a minimum number of renewals on any policy taken out under the program, thus limiting our ability to implement some of our underwriting guidelines. Upon renewal of these policies, however, we analyze replacement cost scenarios to ensure the appropriate amount of coverage is in effect. Our results may be negatively impacted by these limitations.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe have a risk posed by the lack of geographic diversification and concentration of policyholders in Louisiana, Florida and Texas.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had covered risks on approximately 69,000 direct and assumed policies. Of these policies, 32,000, or approximately 46% are in Louisiana, 30,000, or approximately 43%, are in Texas, while the remaining 7,000 policies, or 11% of policies, are in Florida. These three states have significant amounts of exposed coastline.\nMaison insures personal property located in 63 of the 64 parishes in Louisiana, 207 of the 254 counties which comprise the State of Texas, and 31 of the 67 counties which comprise the State of Florida. As of December 31, 2018, these policies are concentrated within Saint Tammany Parish, LA (6.2%), Collin County, TX (5.8%), Jefferson Parish, LA (5.7%), and Tarrant County, TX (5.6%); all of which are expressed as a percentage of our total direct and assumed policies in all states. No other parish in Louisiana nor county in Texas or Florida individually has over 5.0% of our total direct and assumed policies in-force as of December 31, 2018.\nIn the event we do not consummate the Asset Sale with FedNat, we may be unable to significantly expand to other states, we may risk higher reinsurance costs and greater loss experience with storm activity occurring in Texas, Florida and Louisiana.\nOur strategy to expand into other states, may not succeed.\nIf we are unable to consummate the Asset Sale with FedNat, our strategy for growth may include potentially entering into new states. This strategy could divert management\u2019s attention. If we do not complete the Asset Sale and instead pursue this strategy, we cannot predict whether we will be able to enter new states or whether applicable state regulators will grant Maison a license to do business in such states. We cannot know if we will realize the anticipated benefits of operating in new states or if there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with such expansion. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, although we may receive authorization from the insurance regulators in certain states to write business, the order authorizing us to write business may stipulate certain conditions. Should we not be able to comply with these conditions, our expansion into such states may not succeed.\nWe have exposure to unpredictable catastrophes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results if they occur.\nWe offer full peril protection and wind/hail-only insurance policies that cover homeowners and owners of manufactured homes, as well as dwelling fire policies for owners of property rented to others, for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes. We are therefore subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, flood, fire, and by man-made events, such as terrorist attacks. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our policyholders are currently concentrated in Louisiana, Florida and Texas. These states are subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms. For example, in late August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Louisiana and Texas, impacting many of our policyholders. This event primarily impacted our Texas policyholders along with a relatively smaller number of Louisiana policyholders. We expect our total gross incurred losses for Hurricane Harvey to be approximately $29.5 million, and expect to recover $24.5 million from our reinsurers from this event. Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for catastrophes until such an event takes place. Therefore, a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes, could exceed our reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nOur results may fluctuate based on many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\nThe insurance business has historically been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted an increase in pricing and, thus, more favorable underwriting profits. An increase in premium levels is often offset over time by an increasing supply of insurance capacity in the form of capital provided by new entrants and existing insurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance risks. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance business significantly. These factors may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe cannot predict whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we are not able to write insurance at appropriate rates, our ability to transact business would be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreased competition could adversely impact our results and growth.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete not only with other stock companies but also with mutual companies, underwriting organizations and alternative risk sharing mechanisms. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and name recognition than us. While our principal competitors cannot be easily classified, Maison considers its primary competing insurers to be: Access Home Insurance Company, American Integrity Insurance Company, Americas Insurance Company, ASI Lloyds, Centauri Specialty Insurance Company, Family Security Insurance Company, FedNat Insurance Company, First Community Insurance Company, Gulfstream Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Imperial F&C Insurance Company, Lighthouse Property Insurance Corporation, Safepoint Insurance Company, Southern Fidelity Insurance, and United Property & Casualty. As we write both full-peril as well as wind/hail only personal lines insurance throughout the states of Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, our principal lines of business are written by numerous other insurance companies. Competition for any one account may come from very large national firms, smaller regional companies or companies that write insurance only in Florida, Louisiana and/or Texas. We compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of financial strength, availability of coverage desired by customers, underwriting criteria and quality of service to our agents and insureds. We may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future.\nIn addition, industry developments could further increase competition in our industry, including:\n\u25cf an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their businesses and new companies attempt to enter the insurance business as a result of better pricing and/or terms;\n\u25cf the creation or expansion of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage;\n\u25cf changing practices caused by the Internet, which has led to greater competition in the insurance business;\n\u25cf changes to the regulatory climate in the states in which we operate; and\n\u25cf the passage of federal proposals for an optional federal charter that would allow some competing insurers to operate under regulations different or less stringent than those applicable to our insurance subsidiary.\nThese developments and others could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive. If competition limits our ability to write new business at adequate rates, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf our actual losses from insureds exceed our loss reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nWe record liabilities, which are referred to as reserves, for specific claims incurred and reported as well as reserves for claims incurred but not reported. The estimates of losses for reported claims are established on a case-by-case basis. Such estimates are based on our particular experience with the type of risk involved and our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each individual claim. Reserves for reported claims encapsulate our total estimate of the cost to settle the claims, including investigation and defense of the claim, and may be adjusted for differences between costs as originally estimated and the costs as re-estimated or incurred. Reserves for incurred but not reported claims are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors, using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claim costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Although management believes that amounts included in the consolidated financial statements for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are adequate, future changes in loss development, favorable or unfavorable, may occur. Due to these uncertainties, the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $9.5 million were comprised of incurred but not reported reserves of $3.9 million and known case reserves of $5.6 million.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These changes may have a material adverse effect on our business by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued and/or renewed, and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe lack of availability of third party adjusters during periods of high claim frequency, or the failure of third party adjusters to properly evaluate claims or the failure of our claims handling administrator to pay claims fairly could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements.\nWe have outsourced a portion of our claim adjusting function to third party adjusters and therefore rely on these third party adjusters to accurately evaluate claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of their claims representatives, the culture of their respective claims organizations, the effectiveness of their management and their ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support their claims functions. In periods following catastrophic events, or during other periods of high claims frequency, the availability of third party adjusters may be limited. This lack of availability may result in an inability to pay our claims in a timely manner and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, MMI functions as our claims administrator and authorizes payments based on recommendations from third party adjusters; any failure on the part of the third party adjusters to recommend payments on claims fairly could lead to material litigation, or other extra-contractual liabilities, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and adversely affect our financial results.\nIf we do not complete the Asset Sale with FedNat and are unable to expand our business because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results may suffer.\nIn the event we do not consummate the Asset Sale with FedNat, our future growth may depend on our ability to expand the number of insurance policies we write, the kinds of insurance products we offer and the geographic markets in which we do business, all balanced by the business risks we choose to assume and cede. Our existing sources of funds include possible sales of our securities and our earnings from operations and investments. Unexpected catastrophic events in our market areas, such as the hurricanes and other storms experienced in Florida, Louisiana and Texas in recent years, may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to limit or halt any future growth strategy in these and other coastal states we may enter while we deploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims, unless we are able to raise additional capital.\nOur financial results may be negatively affected by the fact that a portion of our income is generated by the investment of our company\u2019s capital and surplus, premiums and loss reserves in various investment vehicles.\nA portion of our expected income is likely to be generated by the investment of our cash reserves in money market funds, bonds, and other investment vehicles. The amount of income generated from these investments is a function of our investment policy, available investment opportunities, and the amount of invested assets. If we experience larger than expected losses, our invested assets may need to be liquidated in order to provide the cash needed to pay current claims, which may result in lower investment income. We periodically review our investment policy in light of our then-current circumstances, including liquidity needs, and available investment opportunities. Fluctuating interest rates and other economic factors make it difficult to accurately estimate the amount of investment income that will actually be realized. We may realize losses on our investments, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe may experience financial exposure from climate change.\nOur financial exposure from climate change is most notably associated with losses in connection with increasing occurrences of weather-related events striking the states in which we insure risks. Our maximum reinsurance coverage amount is determined by subjecting our homeowner exposures to statistical forecasting models that are designed to quantify a catastrophic event in terms of the frequency of a storm occurring once in every 100 years. 100 years is used as a measure of the relative size of a storm as compared to a storm expected to occur once every 250 years, which would be larger, or conversely, a storm expected to occur once every 50 years, which would be smaller. We assess the appropriateness of the level of reinsurance we purchase by giving consideration to our own risk appetite, the opinions of independent rating agencies as well as the requirements of state regulators. Our amount of losses we retain (referred to as our deductible) in connection with a catastrophic event is determined by market capacity, pricing conditions and surplus preservation.\nIndustry trends, such as increased litigation against the insurance industry and individual insurers, the willingness of courts to expand covered causes of loss, rising jury awards, and the escalation of loss severity, may contribute to increased costs and to the deterioration of the reserves of our insurance subsidiary.\nThe propensity of policyholders and third party claimants to litigate, the willingness of courts to expand causes of loss and the size of awards may render the loss reserves of our insurance subsidiary inadequate for current and future losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.\nOur ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry and our ability to expand our business may be negatively affected by the fact that we do not have a rating from A.M. Best.\nWe are not rated by A.M. Best, although our insurance subsidiary company currently has a Financial Stability Rating (FSR) of \u2018A\u2019 Exceptional from Demotech, Inc. We have never been reviewed by A.M. Best and do not intend to seek a rating from A.M. Best. Unlike Demotech, A.M. Best may penalize companies that are highly leveraged, i.e., that utilize reinsurance to support premium writings. We do not plan to give up revenues or efficiency of size as a means to qualify for an acceptable A.M. Best rating. While our Demotech rating has proved satisfactory to date in attracting an acceptable amount of business from independent agents, some independent agents are reluctant to do business with a company that is not rated by A.M. Best. As a result, not having an A.M. Best rating may prevent us from expanding our business into certain independent agencies or limit our access to credit from certain financial institutions, which may in turn limit our ability to compete with large, national insurance companies and certain regional insurance companies.\nAn adverse rating from Demotech may negatively impact our ability to write new policies, renew desirable policies, or obtain adequate reinsurance, which could harm our business.\nAlthough our insurance subsidiary company currently has a Financial Stability Rating of \u2018A\u2019 Exceptional from Demotech, Inc., the withdrawal of our rating could limit or prevent us from writing or renewing desirable insurance policies, from competing with insurers who have higher ratings, or from obtaining adequate reinsurance. Demotech, Inc. may also change their ratings criteria such that we may be unable to maintain our \u2018A\u2019 rating. The withdrawal or downgrade of our rating could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position because our insurance policies may no longer be acceptable to the secondary marketplace or mortgage lenders. Furthermore, a withdrawal or downgrade of our rating could prevent independent agencies from selling and servicing our insurance policies.\nWe rely on independent agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nWhile we have obtained and may, from time to time obtain some of our policies through the assumption of policies from TWIA and LA and FL Citizens, we still require the cooperation and consent of our network of independent agents. We rely on these independent agents to be the primary source for our property insurance policies. Many of our competitors also rely on independent agents. As a result, we must compete with other insurers for independent agents\u2019 business. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower premiums for insurance coverage or higher commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions are not competitive, we may find it difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products, or may receive less attractive business than our competitors. A material reduction in the amount of our products that independent agents sell would adversely affect our revenues.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe face a risk of non-availability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to write business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use, and we expect to continue to use, reinsurance to help manage our exposure to catastrophic losses due to various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, fire and man-made events. The availability and cost of reinsurance are each subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control which can affect business volume and profitability. We may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance coverage, to obtain additional reinsurance coverage in the event our current reinsurance coverage is exhausted by a catastrophic event, or to obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts or at acceptable rates. Similar risks exist whether we are seeking to replace coverage terminated during the applicable coverage period or to renew or replace coverage upon its expiration. Each of the FOIR, LDI and TDI require that we maintain a minimum level of reinsurance coverage as a condition of writing insurance in their jurisdictions. Should we not be able to maintain this coverage, these regulators may revoke our license to write insurance. We can provide no assurance that we can obtain sufficient reinsurance to cover losses resulting from one or more storms in the future, or that we can obtain such reinsurance in a timely or cost-effective manner. If we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or to obtain new reinsurance coverage, either our net exposure to risk would increase or, if we are unwilling to accept an increase in net risk exposures, we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite. Either increasing our net exposure to risk or reducing the amount of risk we underwrite may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe face a risk of non-collectability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAlthough reinsurers are liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we purchase, we remain primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks that we reinsure. Accordingly, our reinsurance agreements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. As a result, we are subject to risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers, including the risks that: (a) our reinsurers may dispute some of our reinsurance claims based on contract terms, and we may ultimately receive partial or no payment, or (b) the amount of losses that reinsurers incur related to worldwide catastrophes may materially harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and cause them to default on their obligations. While we will attempt to manage these risks through underwriting guidelines, collateral requirements, financial strength ratings, credit reviews and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. Further, while we may require collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions, balances generally are not collateralized because it has not always been standard business practice to require security for balances due. As a result, our exposure to credit risk may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe use actuarially driven catastrophe models to provide us with risk management guidelines.\nAs is common practice within the insurance industry, we run our exposures in an actuarially driven model that uses past storm data to predict future loss of certain events reoccurring based upon the location and other data of our insured properties. These models, which are provided by independent third parties, can produce wide ranging results within the states we do business. We use these models along with the advice of our reinsurance intermediary to select the amount and type of reinsurance to mitigate the loss of capital from catastrophic wind events. These models are used to develop future theoretical loss scenarios, and there are risks that the amount of reinsurance purchased will be insufficient to cover the ultimate catastrophic wind event. Furthermore, the probability of the occurrence of a catastrophic event may be larger than that predicted by the models.\nThe failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure including:\n\u25cf utilizing restrictive underwriting criteria;\n\u25cf carefully evaluating and monitoring the terms and conditions of our policies;\n\u25cf focusing on our risk aggregations by geographic zones; and\n\u25cf ceding insurance risk to reinsurance companies.\nHowever, there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics. An event or series of events may result in loss levels which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nVarious provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which have been drafted to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time, we employ a variety of endorsements to our policies that limit exposure to known risks, including but not limited to exclusions relating to flood coverage for homes in close proximity to the coast line. In addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us or to our claims handling administrator and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While our insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would increase our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nMaison is subject to an independent third party rating agency and must maintain certain rating levels to continue to write much of its current and future policies.\nIn the event that Maison fails to maintain an \u201cA\u201d rating given by a rating agency acceptable to both our insurance agents and our insureds\u2019 home lenders, it will be unable to continue to write much of its current and future insurance policies. In order to maintain this rating, among several factors, Maison must maintain certain minimum capital and surplus. The loss of such an acceptable rating may lead to a significant decline in our premium volume and adversely affect the results of our operations. Demotech, Inc. affirmed our Financial Stability Rating of \u201cA\u201d on March 15, 2019. This \u201cExceptional\u201d rating continues as long as we continue to satisfy their requirements, including improving underwriting results, reporting risk-based capital and other financial measures, submitting quarterly statutory financial statements within 45 days of the period end and submitting annual statutory financial statements within 60 days of the period end.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. We currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and a smaller reporting company under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Both emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies are exempt from the requirement to include the auditor\u2019s report of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and we will continue to be exempt until such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company or smaller reporting company. Regardless of our qualification status, we have implemented substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable requirements of Nasdaq, among other items. Maintaining these internal controls is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nOur evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC, or violations of Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWhile we currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, and as a smaller reporting company under SEC regulations, we cannot be certain if we take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to these companies that we will not make our common stock less attractive to investors. Once we lose emerging growth and smaller reporting company status, the costs and demands placed upon our management are expected to increase.\nThe JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies and the SEC\u2019s rules permit smaller reporting companies like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth or smaller reporting companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth or smaller reporting company, we are permitted, and we intend to, omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS Act from the requirements to submit say on pay, say on frequency, and say on golden parachute votes to our stockholders and we will avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2019, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act. In addition, we will continue to be a smaller reporting company until we have more than $250 million in public float (based on our common equity) measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public float (based on our common equity) or a public float that is less than $700 million, annual revenues of more than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.\nWe expect to lose our emerging growth company status as of December 31, 2019. While we expect to remain a smaller reporting company at the time we lose our emerging growth company status, we will face increased disclosure requirements as a non-emerging growth company, such as stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation (\u201csay-on-pay\u201d). Until such time that we lose emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company status, it is unclear if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could cause our stock price to decline. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon our management to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements. In addition, even if we remain a smaller reporting company, if our public float exceeds $75 million, we will become subject to the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring an independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, making the public reporting process more costly.\nWe have directors who also serve as directors and/or executive officers for other public companies or for our controlling stockholders or their affiliates, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nWe have a director who also serve as a director of Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB) (\u201cLimbach\u201d), an affiliate of KFSI (which, together with its affiliates, holds a warrant exercisable for common shares representing 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock), and directors who serve as executive officers and/or directors of FGI and its affiliates, which together, as of December 31, 2018, beneficially owned approximately 45% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, FGI and its affiliates beneficially own 4.9% of our outstanding shares of 8.00% cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A. In addition, one of our directors serves as an executive officer and director of Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFH) (\u201cAtlas\u201d), a specialty commercial automobile insurance company.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur executive officers and members of our Company\u2019s Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders; likewise, persons who serve in similar capacities at Atlas, Limbach and FGI have fiduciary duties to those companies\u2019 investors. We may find, though, the potential for a conflict of interest if our Company and one or more of these other companies pursue acquisitions, investments and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of us. Our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles may, as a result, have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Furthermore, our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles own stock options, shares of common stock and other securities in some of these entities. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and these other entities. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with or participate jointly in investments with Atlas, Limbach or FGI or its affiliates. We may create new situations in the future in which our directors serve as directors or executive officers in future investment holdings of such entities.\nOur information technology systems may fail or suffer a loss of security which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems. We rely on these systems to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for our underwriting business, as well as to handle our policy administration processes (such as the printing and mailing of our policies, endorsements, and renewal notices, etc.). Our operations are dependent upon our ability to process our business timely and efficiently and protect our information systems from physical loss or unauthorized access. In the event one or more of our facilities cannot be accessed due to a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or power outage, or systems and telecommunications failures or outages, external attacks such as computer viruses, malware or cyber-attacks, or other disruptions occur, our ability to perform business operations on a timely basis could be significantly impaired and may cause our systems to be inaccessible for an extended period of time. A sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to perform necessary business operations in a timely manner, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations also depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. From time to time, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. Computer viruses, hackers, phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, ransomware, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. Our systems and networks may be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 information or theft of funds and other monetary loss, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisers or other damage to our business.\nThe development and expansion of our business is dependent upon the successful development and implementation of advanced computer and data processing systems. The failure of these systems to function as planned could slow our growth and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.\nWe believe that our independent agents play a key role in our efforts to increase the number of voluntary policies written by our insurance subsidiary. We utilize various policy administration, rating, and issuance systems. Internet disruptions or system failures of our current policy administration, policy rating and policy issuance system could affect our future business volume and results of operations. In addition, a security breach of our computer systems could damage our reputation or result in liability. We retain confidential information regarding our business dealings and our customers in our computer systems. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. It is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or other disruptive problems. In addition, we could be subject to liability if hackers were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate customer\u2019s personal data or other confidential information.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAny failure on the part of our third-party policy administration processor could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\nWe outsource our policy administration process to an unaffiliated, independent third party service provider. Any failure on the part of such third party to properly handle our policy administration process could lead to material litigation, extra-contractual liabilities, regulatory action, and undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our inexperience as a public company and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our Board of Directors and senior management team has overall responsibility for our management and not all of our directors and members of our senior management team have prior experience in operating a public company. As a publicly-traded company, we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy our periodic SEC reporting and Nasdaq obligations. Management\u2019s past experience may not be sufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate our company. Failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a public company, and the loss of such status may have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and Nasdaq rules, including those promulgated in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we need to continually commit significant resources, maintain staff and provide additional management oversight. In addition, sustaining our growth will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our organization and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a public company, we incur significant annual expenses related to these steps associated with, among other things, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, accounting, legal and administrative personnel, auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. We also incur higher costs for director and officer liability insurance. Any of these factors make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors. Finally, we expect to incur additional costs once we lose emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company status.\nWe may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nDuring the pendency of the Asset Sale, and in the event we do not complete the Asset Sale, our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully, and the risk-based capital requirements which our insurance subsidiary, Maison, is required to maintain as a condition of its certificates of authority issued by the TDI and FOIR, as well as the ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that our present capital is insufficient to meet future operating requirements or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our projected growth. Many factors will affect our capital needs as well as their amount and timing, including our profitability, the availability of reinsurance, market disruptions and other developments. During the pendency of the Asset Sale, we are subject to restrictions on raising additional capital pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. In the event the Asset Sale is not consummated and we have to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our stockholders could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may have to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe development and implementation of new technologies will require an additional investment of our capital resources in the future.\nFrequent technological changes, new products and services and evolving industry standards all influence the insurance business. The Internet, for example, is increasingly used to transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate business-to-business information exchange and transactions. We believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future. We have not determined, however, the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require, which may result in short-term, unexpected interruptions to our business, or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price and/or efficiency, as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies.\nOur success depends on our ability to accurately price the risks we underwrite.\nThe results of our operations and the financial condition of our insurance subsidiary depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data, develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas, closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and thereby price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u25cf the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze such data;\n\u25cf uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\n\u25cf our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques;\n\u25cf changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices and restoration costs; and\n\u25cf legislatively imposed consumer initiatives.\nBecause we have assumed a substantial portion of our current policies from LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA, our rates are based, to a certain extent, on the rates charged by those insurers. In determining the rates we charge in connection with the policies we have assumed, our rates must be equal to or less than the rates previously charged by the state-run insurer. If LA or FL Citizens reduces its rates, we must reduce our rates to keep them equivalent to or less than their rates; however, if LA or FL Citizens increases its rates, we may not automatically increase our rates. Additionally, absent certain circumstances, we must continue to provide coverage to the policyholders that we assume from LA or FL Citizens if we have underwritten the same policyholder for a period of three consecutive years. In determining the rates we charge in connection with the policies we have assumed from TWIA, our rates must be no greater than 115% of premiums charged by TWIA for comparable coverage. Additionally, we must continue to provide coverage to the policyholders under those policies that we have assumed from TWIA for a minimum of three successive renewal periods. If we underprice our risks, it may negatively affect our profit margins and if we overprice risks, it could reduce our customer retention, sales volume and competitiveness. Either event may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our insurance subsidiary.\nCurrent operating resources are necessary to develop future new insurance products.\nIn the event the Asset Sale is not consummated, we may expand our product offerings by underwriting additional insurance products and programs, and marketing them through our distribution network. Expansion of our product offerings will result in increases in expenses due to additional costs incurred in actuarial rate justifications, software and personnel. Offering additional insurance products will also require regulatory approval, further increasing our costs and potentially affecting the speed with which we will be able to pursue new market opportunities. There can be no assurance that, if the Asset Sale is not consummated, we will be successful in bringing new insurance products to our marketplace.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAs an insurance holding company, we are currently subject to regulation by the States of Louisiana, Texas, and Florida and in the future may become subject to regulation by certain other states or a federal regulator.\nAll states regulate insurance holding company systems. State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company in the holding company group to register with the department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material agreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including without limitation loans, investments, asset transfers, transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance transactions, dividends, and consolidated tax allocation agreements. Insurance holding company regulations generally provide that transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates must be fair and equitable, allocated between the parties in accordance with customary accounting practices, and fully disclosed in the records of the respective parties. Many types of transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates, such as transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system, may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by, state regulatory authorities. If we are unable to provide the required materials or obtain the requisite prior approval for a specific transaction, we may be precluded from taking the actions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiary currently operates in Louisiana, Florida and Texas. In the future, our insurance subsidiary may become authorized to transact business in other states and therefore will become subject to the laws and regulatory requirements of those states. These regulations may vary from state to state, and certain states may have regulations which conflict with the regulations of other states. Currently, the federal government\u2019s role in regulating or dictating the policies of insurance companies is limited. However, Congress, from time to time, considers proposals that would increase the role of the federal government in insurance regulation, either in addition to or in lieu of state regulation. The impact of any future federal insurance regulation on our insurance operations is unclear and may adversely impact our business or competitive position.\nOur insurance subsidiary is subject to extensive regulation which may reduce our profitability or inhibit our growth. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated and supervised. Maison, our insurance company subsidiary, is subject to the supervision and regulation of the state in which it is domiciled and the states in which it does business. Such supervision and regulation is primarily designed to protect policyholders rather than stockholders. These regulations are generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things:\n\u25cf the content and timing of required notices and other policyholder information;\n\u25cf the amount of premiums the insurer may write in relation to its surplus;\n\u25cf the amount and nature of reinsurance a company is required to purchase;\n\u25cf approval of insurance company acquisitions;\n\u25cf participation in guaranty funds and other statutorily-created markets or organizations;\n\u25cf business operations and claims practices;\n\u25cf approval of policy forms and premium rates;\n\u25cf standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;\n\u25cf licensing of insurers and their products;\n\u25cf licensing and appointment of agents and managing general agents;\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u25cf restrictions on the ability of our insurance company subsidiary to pay dividends to us;\n\u25cf restrictions on transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates;\n\u25cf restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;\n\u25cf requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u25cf requiring certain methods of accounting;\n\u25cf periodic examinations of our operations and finances;\n\u25cf prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and\n\u25cf requiring reserves as required by statutory accounting rules.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe LDI and regulators in other jurisdictions where our insurance company subsidiary operates or may operate conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, information relating to and notices and approvals of transactions with affiliated parties, and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. These regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers\u2019 business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance operations or differences between our interpretations of regulatory requirements and those of the regulators. In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our business or otherwise penalize us. Any such outcome may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nFinally, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nMaison is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nMaison is subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of Texas, Florida and Louisiana (and other states where we may eventually conduct business). The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, require Maison to report its results of risk-based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company\u2019s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level risk-based capital is determined by applying the NAIC\u2019s risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations.\nIn addition, Maison is required to maintain certain minimum capital and surplus and to limit its written premiums to specified multiples of its capital and surplus. Maison could exceed these ratios if its volume increases faster than anticipated or if its surplus declines due to catastrophic and/or non-catastrophic losses, excessive underwriting and/or operational expenses.\nAny failure by Maison to meet the applicable risk-based capital or minimum statutory capital requirements or the writings ratio limitations imposed by the laws of the states in which Maison operates could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. Any changes in existing risk-based capital requirements, minimum statutory capital requirements or applicable writings ratios may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do.\nShould our retention rate be less than anticipated, our future results will be negatively impacted.\nWe make assumptions about the rate at which our existing policies will renew for the purpose of projecting premiums written and the amount of reinsurance which we obtain based upon the projected amount of future exposure. If the actual exposure renewed is less than anticipated, our premiums written would be adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may purchase more reinsurance than may be appropriate given the actual amount of coverage in force.\nHolders of our outstanding shares of 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares.\nAs of March 18, 2019, we have issued and outstanding 700,000 shares of preferred stock designated as 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $25.00 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is approximately $17.5 million, and annual dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are $1.4 million. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of lawfully available funds for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends from and including the original issue date at the rate of 8.00% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $2.00 per annum per share). Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common shares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of payment. This would reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common shares.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to designate and issue additional preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights that are senior to those of our common shares similar to the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. Because our decision to issue additional securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities issuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interests.\nWe depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate and transfer funds to meet our financial obligations.\nOur operations are substantially conducted through our subsidiaries, Maison, MMI and ClaimCor. As an insurance holding company, we are dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiary companies to serve as operating capital. The ability of Maison, our insurance company subsidiary, to pay dividends to us is subject to certain restrictions imposed under Louisiana insurance law, which is the state of domicile for Maison. Dividends payments to us may also be restricted pursuant to a consent agreement entered into with the LDI and the FOIR as a condition of our licensure in each state. Interest payments on the surplus notes issued to us by Maison are also subject to the prior approval of the LDI. Our other subsidiary companies collect the majority of their revenue through their affiliation with Maison. Our subsidiary company, MMI, earns commission income from Maison for underwriting, policy administration, claims handling, and other services provided to Maison. Our subsidiary company, ClaimCor, earns claims adjusting income for adjusting certain of the claims of Maison\u2019s policyholders. While dividend payments from our other subsidiaries are not restricted under insurance law, the underlying contracts between Maison and our other subsidiary companies are regulated by, and subject to the approval of, insurance regulators.\nAs a result of the regulatory and contractual restrictions described above, we may not be able to receive dividends from Maison or our other subsidiaries, which would affect our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock. Under Delaware corporate law, we are generally restricted to paying dividends from either Company surplus or from net income from the current or preceding fiscal year so long as the payment of the dividends does not reduce the value of the Company\u2019s net assets below the stated value of the Company\u2019s outstanding preferred shares. Our ability to make dividend payments on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock, is therefore dependent on dividends and other distributions or payments from our subsidiaries. The ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us depends upon the availability of cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets and other capital-raising activities. We cannot be certain of the future availability of such distributions and the lack of any such distributions may adversely affect our ability to make dividend payments on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nThe success of our current business operations depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If the quality of our underwriters and other personnel decreases, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate, which could adversely affect our results. Because of the specialized markets in which we currently operate, the loss of, or failure to attract, key personnel could significantly impede the current financial plans, marketing and other objectives of our company. Our success depends to a substantial extent on the ability and experience of our current senior management. In the future, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining skilled and qualified personnel due to the competition for experienced personnel in our industry because many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. We cannot be certain of our ability to identify, hire and retain adequately qualified personnel. In addition, during the pendency of the Asset Sale, we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. We do not have employment agreements with our employees. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nRisks Related to the Asset Sale\nThe announcement and pendency of the Asset Sale, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect our business.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Asset Sale, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, our business or our relationships with our business partners, customers and employees. Third parties such as customers, vendors and business partners may be unwilling to enter into agreements with us with respect to our insurance business and may instead prefer to enter into agreements with our competitors who have not expressed an intention to sell their business because such third parties may perceive that such competitors are likely to be more stable. Additionally, all of the employees of MMI are expected to become employees of Purchaser as of the closing of the Asset Sale, either directly or by remaining employees of MMI, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Underwriting Officer have entered into employment agreements with Purchaser, with the effectiveness of such agreements subject to the occurrence of the closing and continuous employment with the Company through the closing. Consequently, during the pendency of the Asset Sale, we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and the focus and attention of our management and employee resources may be diverted from operational matters.\nThe proposed Asset Sale is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. Failure to complete the Asset Sale could materially and adversely affect our future business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nIf we fail to complete the Asset Sale, our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price may be harmed.\nThe completion of the Asset Sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the approval of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, including the Asset Sale, by our stockholders and certain regulatory approvals, which conditions may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to satisfy the closing conditions in Purchaser\u2019s favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied or otherwise waived, Purchaser will not be obligated to complete the Asset Sale. In the event that the Asset Sale is not completed, the announcement of the termination of the Purchase Agreement may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. We may also face significantly higher reinsurance costs than in the past if the Asset Sale is not completed.\nIn addition, if we do not complete the Asset Sale or if the completion of the Asset Sale is delayed for any reason, our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price may be harmed because:\n\u25cf management\u2019s and our employees\u2019 attention may be diverted from our day-to-day operations as they focus on matters related to the Asset Sale;\n\u25cf we could potentially lose key employees if such employees decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the Asset Sale;\n\u25cf we could potentially lose business partners, customers or vendors, and new customer or strategic contracts could be delayed or decreased;\n\u25cf we have agreed to restrictions in the Purchase Agreement that limit how we conduct our business prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, including, among other things, restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to amend their organizational documents, declare and pay dividends, issue, deliver or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity interests, hire, promote, transfer or terminate certain employees, take certain actions with respect to employee benefit plans, make certain capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions, sell, transfer or dispose of assets, enter into, amend or terminate certain material contracts, and incur indebtedness; these restrictions may not be in our best interests and may disrupt or otherwise adversely affect our business and our relationships with our business partners and customers, prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, limit our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities, and otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations;\n\u25cf we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses related to the Asset Sale, such as legal, financial advisory and accounting fees, and other expenses that are payable by us whether or not the Asset Sale is completed;\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n\u25cf we may be required to pay a termination fee of $2.16 million to Purchaser if the Purchase Agreement is terminated under circumstances related to a change of recommendation by our Board with respect to the approval of the Purchase Agreement, which would negatively affect our financial results and liquidity;\n\u25cf activities related to the Asset Sale and related uncertainties may lead to a loss of revenue and market position that we may not be able to regain if the Asset Sale does not occur; and\n\u25cf the failure to consummate, or delays in consummating the Asset Sale may result in a negative impression of us with business partners, customers, potential business partners, potential customers or the investment community.\nThe occurrence of these or other events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, our stock price may fluctuate significantly based on announcements by us, Purchaser or other third parties regarding the Asset Sale or our business.\nIn addition, if the Asset Sale is not completed, our Board, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our stockholders, may evaluate other strategic alternatives that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to us as the Asset Sale. Any future sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company or other transactions may be subject to further stockholder approval and the satisfaction of certain other conditions.\nIn order to complete the Asset Sale, the Company and Purchaser must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with burdensome conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the Asset Sale may be jeopardized or prevented or the anticipated benefits of the Asset Sale could be reduced.\nCompletion of the Asset Sale is conditioned upon the receipt of approvals from the insurance regulators in certain specified jurisdictions. Although the Company and Purchaser have agreed in the Purchase Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to make certain filings and obtain the required governmental approvals, as the case may be, the required approvals may not be obtained and the Asset Sale may not be completed. In addition, the insurance regulators from which these approvals are required have discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the Asset Sale and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. These regulators may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the Asset Sale, or may, as a condition to the approval of the Asset Sale or related transactions, impose conditions or restrictions on the ability of the parties to obtain the required approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, none of the Company or Maison, MMI or ClaimCor, nor Purchaser or any of its affiliates, will be required to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining or complying with any required regulatory approvals that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company and Maison, MMI and ClaimCor, taken as a whole, or Purchaser and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the closing of the Asset Sale.\nOur stockholders are not guaranteed any of the proceeds from the Asset Sale.\nThe proceeds from the Asset Sale will be paid directly to us. Our Board will evaluate different alternatives for the use of the proceeds from the Asset Sale, which are expected to include using a portion of the cash consideration to conduct the business of our reinsurance subsidiary, PIH Re, Ltd., and launching a new growth strategy focused on reinsurance, investment management and new investment opportunities. The Company may form an additional reinsurance subsidiary in a suitable jurisdiction. We could spend or invest the net proceeds from the Asset Sale in ways with which our stockholders may not agree, and the investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Purchase Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer.\nThe Purchase Agreement contains \u201cno solicitation\u201d provisions that, in general, restrict our ability to solicit any competing acquisition proposals or to engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations relating to any competing acquisition proposals, subject to certain limited exceptions, including a 30-day \u201cGo-Shop Period\u201d in which we are permitted to solicit competing acquisition proposals or enter into discussions or negotiations in connection therewith. In addition, from the end of the Go-Shop Period to the time our stockholders approve the Purchase Agreement, our Board, subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, may withdraw or change its recommendation with respect to the Purchase Agreement and Asset Sale or terminate the Purchase Agreement if we receive an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior proposal (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), in which case Purchaser has an opportunity to modify or revise the terms of the Purchase Agreement such that the third-party proposal no longer constitutes a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Purchase Agreement to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal, we may be required to pay Purchaser a termination fee of $2.16 million. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer from considering or proposing an acquisition transaction, even if it were prepared to pay a higher price than what would be received in the Asset Sale. These provisions might also result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another purchaser for Maison, MMI and/or ClaimCor or another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Asset Sale.\nCertain of our executive officers have interests in the Asset Sale that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.\nCertain of our executive officers have interests in the Asset Sale that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. These interests include:\n\u25cf employment agreements entered into by Douglas N. Raucy, our current President and Chief Executive Officer and a director, and Dean E. Stroud, our current Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer, with Purchaser, providing for the employment of Messrs. Raucy and Stroud by Purchaser upon the closing of the Asset Sale;\n\u25cf accelerated vesting, upon the closing of the Asset Sale, of certain outstanding Company equity compensation awards, if approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board;\n\u25cf potential retention bonuses paid to certain of our employees in consideration for their ongoing employment with the Insurance Companies through the closing of the Asset Sale, including employees who also serve as executive officers of the Company; and\n\u25cf rights to ongoing indemnification.\nThese interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The Board was aware of these potentially differing interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the Purchase Agreement and in making its decision to approve the Purchase Agreement and the transactions thereunder, including the Asset Sale.\nWe will incur significant expenses in connection with the Asset Sale, regardless of whether the Asset Sale is completed and, in certain circumstances, may be required to pay a termination fee to Purchaser.\nWe have and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Asset Sale, whether or not it is completed. We expect to incur approximately $1.5 million of anticipated closing costs which include, but are not limited to, financial advisory and opinion fees and expenses, legal fees, accounting fees and expenses, certain employee expenses, filing fees, printing expenses and other related fees and expenses. Many of these expenses will be payable by us regardless of whether the Asset Sale is completed. In addition, if the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances related to a change of recommendation by the Board with respect to the Purchase Agreement and Asset Sale, we may be required to pay Purchaser a termination fee of $2.16 million. Payment of the termination fee by us as a standalone entity, combined with the anticipated expenses we expect to incur in connection with the Asset Sale, would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and would likely adversely affect our stock price.\nThe shares of Purchaser common stock we will receive as part of the consideration for the Asset Sale will not be registered and will be subject to certain limitations and restrictions.\nThe shares of Purchaser common stock that will be issued to us as part of the consideration of the Asset Sale will not be registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be restricted securities under the Securities Act. We may not sell the Purchaser shares acquired in the Asset Sale unless (i) the shares are registered under the Securities Act or are otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to an available exemption and (ii) a sale or transfer of the shares is permitted by applicable U.S. state securities laws. In connection with the closing of the Asset Sale, we plan to enter into a Registration Rights Agreement with Purchaser providing for the registration of the Purchaser shares under the Securities Act. The value of Purchaser\u2019s shares may significantly decline between the time we receive the shares at the closing of the Asset Sale and the time we are able to freely sell the shares, which would decrease the total amount of consideration we receive in the Asset Sale.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nIn addition, the shares of Purchaser common stock we will receive in the Asset Sale are expected to be issued pursuant to the terms of a Standstill Agreement to be entered into between the Company and Purchaser upon the closing of the Asset Sale. The Standstill Agreement is expected to impose certain limitations and restrictions with respect to our ownership of Purchaser common stock, including, among other things, requiring us to vote all of the voting securities of Purchaser we own in accordance with the recommendation of Purchaser\u2019s board of directors and prohibiting us from publicly advising or influencing any person with respect to the voting of any shares of Purchaser common stock and taking any action to nominate any person for election to Purchaser\u2019s board of directors. Our status as a minority stockholder of Purchaser as well as the limitations and restrictions expected to be set forth in the Standstill Agreement may limit our ability to exert significant influence on Purchaser\u2019s management and operations and matters requiring approval of Purchaser\u2019s stockholders. Purchaser\u2019s management and holders of a larger percentage of Purchaser\u2019s common stock may also take or encourage actions that decrease the value of our shares of Purchaser common stock or are not in our best interests as a minority stockholder.\nRisks Related to Our Future Operations Following the Asset Sale\nIf the Asset Sale is completed, we will no longer be engaged in the retail insurance and claims adjustment businesses, our operations will be limited and our stock price may decline.\nIf the Asset Sale is completed and we sell all of the equity interests of Maison, MMI and ClaimCor, we will no longer be engaged in the retail insurance and claims adjustment businesses. Following closing, we plan to conduct limited business operations despite the sale of assets that generate a significant portion of our revenue. Our Board will evaluate alternatives for the use of the cash consideration we receive from the Asset Sale, which are expected to include using a portion of the cash consideration to conduct the business of our reinsurance subsidiary, PIH Re, Ltd., and launching a new growth strategy focused on reinsurance, investment management and new investment opportunities. The Company may form another reinsurance subsidiary in a suitable jurisdiction. Although our Board will evaluate various alternatives regarding the use of the cash consideration, it has not committed to make any such decision by a particular date, and this uncertainty may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. We also expect that, following the closing of the Asset Sale, our revenue will be reduced, as we will have limited assets with which to generate revenue, and our business prospects may be limited, which may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFollowing the completion of the Asset Sale, we will be subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants under the Purchase Agreement, which may limit our operations in certain respects.\nIf the Asset Sale is completed, we will be subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in the Purchase Agreement for a period of five years from the closing date of the Asset Sale. During this period of time, subject to certain exceptions, we will generally be prohibited from (i) marketing, selling and issuing residential property and casualty insurance policies to residential consumers anywhere in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas (a \u201cRestricted Business\u201d), and owning the equity securities of, managing, operating or controlling any person that engages in a Restricted Business, (ii) hiring or soliciting certain employees of Purchaser or the companies sold under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and (iii) soliciting or accepting business from certain third parties on any customer, agent or vendor list of Maison, MMI, or ClaimCor in connection with a Restricted Business. The non-competition covenant does not apply to our reinsurance business, and we will be permitted to enter into reinsurance contracts in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas.\nThe limitations set forth in the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants may negatively impact the scope of our future operations, limit our recruitment of key employees, restrict our ability to enter into strategic relationships, and impair our ability to pursue certain business alternatives following the Asset Sale, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe do not have an operating history or established reputation in the reinsurance industry, and our lack of an established operating history and reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain business.\nFollowing the completion of the Asset Sale, we expect to use a portion of the cash consideration received in the Asset Sale to conduct the business of our reinsurance subsidiary, PIH Re, Ltd., which is domiciled under the laws of Bermuda, and we may form an additional reinsurance subsidiary in a suitable jurisdiction. We will not have an operating history on which we can base an estimate of our future earnings prospects. We also do not have an established reputation in the reinsurance industry. Reputation is a very important factor in the reinsurance industry, and competition for business is, in part, based on reputation. Although our reinsurance policies will be fully collateralized, we will be a relatively newly formed reinsurance company and do not yet have a well-established reputation in the reinsurance industry. Our lack of an established reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain business. We will compete with major reinsurers, all of which have substantially greater financial marketing and management resources than we do, which may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a profit. In addition, we do not have or currently intend to obtain financial strength ratings, which may discourage certain counterparties from entering into reinsurance contracts with us.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain approval of insurance regulators and other regulatory authorities as required for the operations of our reinsurance subsidiary may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPIH Re, Ltd., as a Bermuda domiciled entity, is required to maintain licenses. PIH Re, Ltd. is registered as a reinsurer only in Bermuda. Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations and policies of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, or \u201cBMA,\u201d require that PIH Re, Ltd., among other things, maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus, satisfy solvency standards, restrict dividends and distributions, obtain prior approval or provide notification to the BMA of certain transactions, maintain a head office, and have certain officers and a director resident in Bermuda, appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda and provide for the performance of certain periodic examinations of itself and its financial conditions. A failure to meet these conditions may result in the suspension or revocation of its license to do business as a reinsurance company in Bermuda, which would mean that PIH Re, Ltd. would not be able to enter into any new reinsurance contracts until the suspension ended or it became licensed in another jurisdiction. For any or a number of reasons, the BMA could revoke or suspend PIH Re, Ltd.\u2019s license. Any such suspension or revocation of its license would negatively impact its and our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, other reinsurance subsidiaries we may form in other foreign jurisdictions will be subject to the requirements of those jurisdictions, and we may fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements.\nAs a reinsurer, we will depend on our clients\u2019 evaluations of the risks associated with their insurance underwriting, which may subject us to reinsurance losses.\nIn the proportional reinsurance business, in which we will assume an agreed percentage of each underlying insurance contract being reinsured, or quota share contracts, we do not plan to separately evaluate each of the original individual risks assumed under these reinsurance contracts. We will therefore be largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies, which will subject us to the risk that the clients may not have adequately evaluated the insured risks and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. We also do not plan to separately evaluate each of the individual claims made on the underlying insurance contracts under quota share arrangements, in which case we will be dependent on the original claims decisions made by our clients.\nThe inability to obtain business from brokers could adversely affect our business strategy and results of operations.\nWe anticipate that a substantial portion of our reinsurance business will be placed primarily through brokered transactions, which involve a limited number of reinsurance brokers. If we are unable to identify and grow the brokered business provided through one or more of these reinsurance brokers, many of whom may not be familiar with the Bermuda jurisdiction of our reinsurance subsidiary, this failure could significantly and negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe involvement of reinsurance brokers may subject us to their credit risk.\nAs a standard practice of the reinsurance industry, reinsurers frequently pay amounts owed on claims under their policies to reinsurance brokers, and these brokers, in turn, remit these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with the reinsurer. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, the reinsurer might remain liable to the client for the deficiency notwithstanding the broker\u2019s obligation to make such payment. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the client pays premiums for policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to the reinsurer, these premiums are considered to have been paid and the client will no longer be liable to the reinsurer for these premiums, whether or not the reinsurer has actually received them from the broker. Consequently, as a reinsurer, we expect to assume a degree of credit risk associated with the brokers that we intend to do business with.\nWe may be unable to purchase retrocessional reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure, and if we successfully purchase such retrocessional reinsurance, we may be unable to collect, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRetrocessional coverage (reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure) may not always be available to us or may not always be available at acceptable terms. From time to time, as a reinsurer we expect that we will purchase retrocessional coverage for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of a potential concentration of losses upon our financial condition. The insolvency or inability or refusal of a retrocessional reinsurer to make payments under the terms of its agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because we will remain primarily liable to our client. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of retrocession that they consider adequate for their business needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional coverage or negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain retrocession from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. Our failure to establish adequate retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in carrying out our investment and investment management strategy, and fair value of our investments will be subject to a loss in value.\nWe plan to form an investment advisory firm (the \u201cAdvisor\u201d) and to use one or more affiliated investment advisers registered with the SEC (the \u201cSub Advisors\u201d) to carry out our investment advisory services. Through the investment portfolio of our reinsurance subsidiaries, we plan to be a seed investor in a number of newly created private funds that, we expect, will pursue investment strategies ranging the full spectrum in alternative equities, fixed income, private equity and real estate. In exchange for seeding the new funds, we expect to receive a special interest in each new fund (or its general partner). Since we plan to conduct our investment activities through private funds, our contributions made to those funds may be subject to lock-up agreements and our ability to access this capital may be limited for a defined period, which may increase a risk of loss of all or a significant portion of value. Our investments may also become concentrated. A significant decline in the major values of these investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings.\nAs discussed in \u201cAncillary Agreements - Investment Advisory Agreement,\u201d in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Advisor and Buyer plan to enter into an investment advisory agreement in which the Advisor will provide non-discretionary investment advisory services to the Buyer. The Advisor plans to use the affiliated Sub Advisors to carry out the services under this agreement with the Buyer. The Advisor and affiliated Sub Advisors plan to develop relationships with other insurance companies to provide investment advisory services. Any fees received for such services may not be commensurate with the services provided. We also may not be able to enter into such advisory management agreements on favorable terms, or at all.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will be subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe will be subject to the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we currently operate our business.\nWe will monitor the value of our investments and plan to structure our operations and transactions to qualify for exemptions under the Investment Company Act. Accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.\nOur results of operations will fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\nWe anticipate that the performance of our reinsurance operations and our future investment portfolio will fluctuate from period to period. In addition, because we plan to underwrite products and make investments to achieve favorable return on equity over the long-term, our short-term results of operations may not be indicative of our long-term prospects. Our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by the general conditions and outlook of the reinsurance markets as well as capital markets.\nWe will be a very small public company with a large cash balance relative to our market capitalization.\nOnce the Asset Sale is completed, we will remain a publicly traded company and will continue to be subject to the listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and will have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act even though compliance with these reporting requirements is economically burdensome. Unless we decide to deregister our shares and suspend our periodic reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, we will continue to incur ongoing operating expenses related to our status as a reporting issuer.\nThe uncertainty regarding the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale and our future operations may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nAlthough our Board will evaluate various alternatives regarding the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale, it has made no final decision with respect to the use of proceeds and has not committed to make any such decision by a particular date. Our Board will have broad discretion in finalizing the use of proceeds, which our investors may not agree with. This uncertainty may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and management, which could adversely impact our ability to successfully implement and execute our growth strategy.\nThe successful implementation of our growth strategy post-closing of the Asset Sale will depend in large part upon the ability and experience of members of our senior management and other personnel. In addition, our performance will be dependent on our ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified management and personnel with experience in the reinsurance industry and investment advisory services. We may not be able to attract and retain such personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. If we lose the service of qualified management or other personnel or are unable to attract and retain the necessary members of senior management or personnel post-closing of the Asset Sale, we may not be able to successfully execute on our business strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nFailure to complete the Asset Sale may cause the market price for our common shares to decline.\nIf our stockholders fail to approve the Asset Sale, of if the Asset Sale is not completed for any other reason, the market price of our common shares may decline due to various potential consequences, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf we may not be able to sell the equity of Maison, MMI and/or ClaimCor to another party on terms as favorable to us as the terms of the Purchase Agreement;\n\u25cf the failure to complete the Asset Sale may create substantial doubt as to our ability to effectively implement our current business strategies; and\n\u25cf our costs related to the Asset Sale, such as legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the Asset Sale is not completed.\nWe may fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq and may have to delist our common shares.\nEven though we currently satisfy the continued listing standards for Nasdaq and expect to continue to do so following the completion of the Asset Sale, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the continued listing standards in the future. In the event that we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our common shares may be delisted from that market. Any delisting of our common shares from Nasdaq could:\n\u25cf adversely affect our ability to attract new investors;\n\u25cf decrease the liquidity of our outstanding common shares;\n\u25cf reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital;\n\u25cf reduce the price at which our common shares trade; and\n\u25cf increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such common shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders.\nIn addition, delisting of our common shares could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common shares, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our common shares and our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14607, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "PIH"}
