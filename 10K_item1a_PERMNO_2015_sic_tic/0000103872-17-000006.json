{"cik": "103872", "company": "VOLT INFORMATION SCIENCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors\nWe maintain a risk management program which incorporates assessments by our officers, senior management and board of directors, as periodically updated. The following risks have been identified. You should carefully consider the following risks along with the other information contained in this report. The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock. Other risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently do not recognize as material could also materially adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market price of our common stock.\nThe contingent staffing industry is very competitive with few significant barriers to entry\nThe markets for Volt\u2019s staffing services are highly competitive. There are few barriers to entry, so new entrants frequently appear resulting in considerable market fragmentation. We have over 100 competitors with annual revenues over $300 million, some of whom are larger than us and have greater resources than we do. These competitors may be better able than we are to attract and retain qualified personnel, to offer more favorable pricing and terms, or otherwise attract and retain the business that we seek. In addition, some of our staffing services customers, generally larger companies, are mandated or otherwise motivated to utilize the services of small or minority-owned companies rather than publicly held corporations such as Volt, and have redirected substantial amounts of their staffing business to those companies. We also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective customers may decide to provide similar services internally.\nIn our business segments, we have experienced competition and pressure on price, margins and markups for renewals of customers\u2019 contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete in our business segments without impacting revenue or margins. Additionally, our ongoing efforts to manage costs in relation to our business volumes may not be successful, and the timing of these efforts and associated earnings charges may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is adversely affected by weak economic and other business conditions\nDuring periods of elevated unemployment levels demand for contingent and permanent personnel decreases, which adversely impacts our staffing services. During slower economic activity, many of our customers reduce their use of contingent workers before undertaking layoffs of their own employees, resulting in decreased demand for contingent workers. Decreased demand and higher unemployment levels result in lower levels of pay rate increases and increased pressure on our markup of staffing service rates and direct margins and higher unemployment insurance costs. Since employees are also reluctant to risk changing employers, there are fewer openings available resulting in reduced activity in permanent placements. In recent years, many of our customers have significantly reduced their workforce, including their use of contingent labor.\nOur credit facility contains financial covenants that may limit our ability to take certain actions\nWe remain dependent upon others for our financing needs and our current credit facility includes certain financial covenants. These covenants could constrain the execution of our business strategy and growth plans. Our ability to continue to meet these financial covenants is not assured. If we default under any of these requirements, our lenders could declare all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees due and payable or significantly increase the cost of the facility. Under such circumstances, there could be no assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the indebtedness at favorable rates or at all. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. As of October 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenant requirements.\nOur recent amendment to our credit facility contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (\u201cEBIT\u201d) and liquidity covenant tests. Sources from certain liquidity events expected to be realized by the Company may be key factors in meeting our covenant obligations.\nThe inability to renew our credit facility could negatively affect our operations and limit our liquidity\nWe rely on financing for future working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. The structure of our financing requires us to renew our arrangements periodically. There can be no assurance that refinancing will be available to us or that we will be able to negotiate replacement financing at reasonable costs or on reasonable terms. The volatility in credit and capital markets may create additional risks to our business in the future. Turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nImproper disclosure of sensitive or confidential employee or customer data, including personal data, could result in liability and harm our reputation\nOur business involves the use, storage and transfer of certain information about our full-time and contingent employees, customers and other individuals. This information contains sensitive or confidential employee and customer data, including personally identifiable information. Cyber attacks or other data breaches, as well as risks associated with compliance with applicable data privacy laws, could have an adverse effect on our systems, services, reputation and financial results. Additionally, our employees may have access or exposure to customer data and systems. The misuse of information could result in legal liability. It is possible that our security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party service providers follow may not prevent improper access to, or disclosure of, such information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and data privacy laws in various countries and jurisdictions, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which are not uniform and may possibly conflict in jurisdictions and countries where we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nThe possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens. We may be required to incur significant expenses to secure our systems and comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nWe are subject to employment-related claims, commercial indemnification claims and other claims and losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business\nOur staffing services business employs or engages individuals on a contingent basis and places them in a customer\u2019s workplace. Our ability to control the customer\u2019s workplace is limited, and we risk incurring liability to our employees for injury (which can result in increased workers\u2019 compensation costs) or other harm that they suffer in the scope of employment at the customer\u2019s workplace or while under the customer\u2019s control. In addition, we may face claims related to violations of wage and hour regulations, discrimination, harassment, negligence or misconduct by our employees, and claims relating to the misclassification of independent contractors, among other types of claims.\nAdditionally, we risk liability to our customers for the actions or inactions of our employees, including those individuals employed on a contingent basis that may cause harm to our customers. Such actions may be the result of negligence or misconduct on the part of our employees, damage to customer facilities or property due to negligence, criminal activity and other similar claims. In some cases, we must indemnify our customers for certain acts of our employees, and certain customers have negotiated increases in the scope of such indemnification agreements. We also may incur fines, penalties and losses that are not covered by insurance or negative publicity with respect to these matters. There can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we have in place will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks.\nCosts related to litigation, legal proceedings and investigations could adversely impact our financial condition\nWe may be involved in pending and threatened legal proceedings and investigations by government and regulatory agencies from time to time, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. It is uncertain at what point any such matters may affect us, and there can be no assurance that our financial resources or insurance policies are sufficient to cover the cost of any or all of such claims. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such matters would not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur information technology projects may not yield their intended results\nWe currently have internal information technology projects in process, including improvements to applicant onboarding and tracking systems and ERP systems. Although the technology is intended to increase productivity and operating efficiencies, these projects may not yield their intended results. Any delays in completing, or an inability to successfully implement these technology initiatives or an inability to achieve the anticipated efficiencies could adversely affect our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe loss of major customers could adversely impact our business\nWe experience revenue concentration with large customers within certain operating segments. Although we have no customer that represents over 10% of our consolidated revenue, there are customers that exceed 10% of revenues within certain segments. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of these customers or multiple customers in a similar industry, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, any reductions, delays or cancellation of contracts with any of our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could materially reduce our revenue and operating income. There is no assurance that our current customers will continue to do business with us or that contracts with existing customers will continue at current or historical levels.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and internal controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis. We may also not be able to accurately forecast our future results including available cash, which could negatively impact our available working capital for operations. These circumstances could lead to a significant decrease in the trading price of our shares, or the delisting of our shares from the NYSE MKT, which would harm our shareholders.\nNew and increased government regulation, employment costs or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, especially for our contingent staffing business\nCertain of our businesses are subject to licensing and regulation in some states and most foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these requirements, or that the cost of compliance will not become material. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which we do or intend to do business may:\n\u2022\ncreate new or additional regulations that mandate additional requirements or prohibit or restrict the types of services that we currently provide;\n\u2022\nchange regulations in ways that cause short-term disruption or impose costs to comply;\n\u2022\nimpose new or additional employment costs that we may not be able to pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services, especially in our staffing services;\n\u2022\nrequire us to obtain additional licenses; or\n\u2022\nincrease taxes (especially payroll and other employment-related taxes) or enact new or different taxes payable by the providers or users of services such as those offered by us, thereby increasing our costs, some of which we may not be able to pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services especially in our staffing services, which could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\nIn some of our foreign markets, new and proposed regulatory activity may impose additional requirements and costs, which could have an adverse effect on our contingent staffing business.\nOur operational results could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations and other global business risks\nOur global operations subject us to risks relating to our international business activities, including global economic conditions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and numerous legal and regulatory requirements placed upon the Company\u2019s international clients. Variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels in any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business may severely reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nOur business is exposed to fluctuation in exchange rates. Our operations outside the United States are reported in the applicable local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rates for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Exchange rates for currencies of these countries may fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar and these fluctuations may have an adverse or favorable effect on our operating results when translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\nIn addition, the Company faces risks in complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, including U.S. legal requirements, governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences, difficulty in staffing and managing international operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) referendum to exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The terms of Brexit and the resulting U.K./E.U. relationship are uncertain for companies doing business both in the U.K. and the overall global economy. The U.K. vote has impacted global markets, including various currencies, and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound as compared to the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. The fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on non U.S. currency transactions. Volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates may continue as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. While we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on our business to date, we cannot predict its future implications. Any impact from Brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations the U.K. conducts.\nFluctuations in interest rates and turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations\nWhile we have access to global credit markets, credit markets may experience significant disruption or deterioration, which could make future financing difficult or more expensive to secure. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board, which recently increased rates and may continue to do so. Increases in interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs over time and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIf a financial institution that is party to our credit facility were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreement with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our contracts provide no minimum purchase requirements, are cancellable during the term, or both\nIn our staffing services business most contracts are not sole source, and many of our contracts, even those with multi-year terms, provide no assurance of any minimum amount of revenue. Under many of these contracts we still must compete for each individual placement or project. In addition, many of our long-term contracts contain cancellation provisions under which the customer can cancel the contract at any time or on relatively short notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Therefore, these contracts do not provide the assurances that typical long-term contracts often provide and are inherently uncertain with respect to the amount of revenue and earnings we may recognize. Consequently, in all our business segments, if customers do not utilize our services under existing contracts or do not renew existing contracts, our results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nNew business initiatives may have an adverse effect on our business\nAs part of our business strategy, we have implemented new initiatives to exit our non-core and unprofitable businesses. This includes actions to optimize our organizational structure, technology and delivery of services and to reduce the cost of operating our business. As our business continues to experience significant changes related to the implementation of our business strategy, we risk the loss of critical internal personnel necessary to execute on this strategy. If these initiatives are ineffective or insufficient, we may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow may be negatively affected if we are not able to keep pace with rapid changes in technology\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. We must innovate and evolve our services and products to satisfy customer requirements and to remain competitive. There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to foresee changes needed to identify, develop and commercialize innovative and competitive services and products in a timely and cost-effective manner to achieve customer acceptance in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product and service introductions.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems which are vulnerable to damage and interruption\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, manage a variety of business processes and activities, and comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities, collection and retention of customer data, employee information and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. These information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due\nto failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Our sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, if our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner.\nWe are dependent upon the quality of our personnel\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, for temporary assignments for customers of our staffing services, projects at clients of our information technology infrastructure services as well as in the areas of implementation and upgrading of internal systems. The availability of such skilled personnel is dependent upon a number of economic and demographic conditions. We may, in the future, find it difficult or more costly to hire such personnel in the face of competition from our competitors.\nIn addition, variations in the unemployment rate and higher wages sought by contingent workers in certain technical fields that continue to experience labor shortages could affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands in these fields and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are also dependent on the continued efforts of our senior management and the performance and productivity of our managers and in-house field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by the quality of services rendered. The loss of high quality personnel and members of management with significant experience in our industry without replacement by personnel with similar quality and experience may cause a significant disruption to our business. Moreover, the loss of key managers and field personnel could jeopardize existing customer relationships which may be based upon long-standing relationships with those managers and field personnel.\nOur ability to retain acceptable insurance coverage limits at commercially reasonable cost and terms may adversely impact our financial results\nWe cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and at commercially reasonable cost, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies.\nOur insurance policies for various exposures including, but not limited to, general liability, automobile liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, professional liability, employment practices, loss to real and personal property, business interruption, fiduciary and other management liability, are limited and the losses that we may face may be not be covered, may be subject to high deductibles or may exceed the limits purchased.\nUnexpected changes in workers' compensation and other insurance plans may negatively impact our financial condition\nLiability for workers\u2019 compensation, general and automobile liability is insured under a retrospective experience-rated insurance program for losses exceeding specified deductible levels and the Company is self-insured for losses below specified deductible limits.\nThe Company is self-insured for a portion of its medical benefit programs. The liability for the self-insured medical benefits is limited on a per-claimant basis through the purchase of stop-loss insurance. The Company\u2019s retained liability for the self-insured medical benefits is determined by utilizing actuarial estimates of expected claims based on statistical analysis of historical data.\nUnexpected changes related to our workers\u2019 compensation, medical and disability benefit plans may negatively impact our financial condition. Changes in the severity and frequency of claims, in state laws regarding benefit levels and allowable claims, actuarial estimates, or medical cost inflation could result in costs that are significantly higher. If future claims-related liabilities increase beyond our expectations, or if we must make unfavorable adjustments to accruals for prior accident years, our costs could increase significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover the increased costs that result from any changes in claims-related liabilities.\nHealth care reform could increase the costs of the Company\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) among other regulations, subjects us to potential penalties unless we offer our employees minimum essential health care coverage that is affordable and provides minimum value. In order to comply with the employer mandate provision of the Act, we offer health care coverage to all employees eligible for coverage under the Act. Designating employees as eligible is complex, and is subject to challenge by employees and the Internal Revenue Service. A determination that we failed to offer the required health coverage to eligible employees could result in penalties that may harm our business. We cannot be certain that compliant insurance coverage will remain available to us on reasonable terms. It is anticipated that there will be changes to the Act in the near term, but we cannot predict what those changes will be or when they will take effect, and we could face additional risks arising from such changes or changed interpretations of our obligations under the Act. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all related costs through increased pricing to our customers or that they will be recovered in the period in which costs are incurred, and the net financial impact on our results of operations could be significant.\nDecline in our operating results could lead to impairment charges relating to our goodwill and long-lived assets\nWe regularly monitor our goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment indicators. In conducting our goodwill impairment testing, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to the related net book value. The Company performs its annual impairment review of goodwill in its second fiscal quarter and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. In conducting our impairment analysis of long-lived assets, we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets. In the event that we determine that our goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur stock price could be volatile and, as a result, investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them\nOur stock price has in the past, and could in the future, fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the expectations of the investment community or our estimates of our future results of operations;\n\u2022\nindustry trends and the business success of our customers;\n\u2022\nloss of one or more key customers;\n\u2022\nstrategic moves by our competitors, such as product or service announcements or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nother domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022\nany of the other previously noted risk factors.\nThe stock market has experienced, and is likely to in the future experience, volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain shareholders, whose interests may differ from those of other shareholders, own a significant percentage of our common stock and are able to exercise significant influence over Volt\nOwnership of a significant amount of our outstanding common stock was concentrated among certain shareholders, including related family members and certain funds. Although there can be no assurance as to how these shareholders will vote, if they were to vote in the same manner, certain combinations of these shareholders might be able to control the composition of our Board of Directors and other matters requiring shareholder approval and could continue to have significant influence over our affairs. The interests of our substantial shareholders may not align with those of our other shareholders.\nFurthermore, the provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law, to which we are subject, require the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of all of our outstanding shares entitled to vote to adopt a plan of merger or consolidation between us and another entity and to approve any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets not made in our usual and regular course of business. Accordingly, our substantial shareholders, acting together, could prevent the approval of such transactions even if such transactions are in the best interests of our other shareholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting or other shareholder activism\nIn fiscal 2014 and 2015, the Company was subjected to a threatened proxy contest, which resulted in the negotiation of significant changes to the Board of Directors and substantial costs were incurred.\nA future proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors. The potential of a proxy contest or other shareholder activism could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key business partners, result in the loss of potential business opportunities or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties related to stockholder activism.\nNew York State law and our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain provisions that could make a takeover of Volt more difficult\nCertain provisions of New York State law and our articles of incorporation and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring Volt, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws include:\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees;\n\u2022\npermitting removal of directors only for cause; and\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies on the Board of Directors will be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office.\nIn addition to the voting power of our substantial shareholders discussed above, our Board of Directors could choose not to negotiate with a potential acquirer that it did not believe was in our strategic best interests. If an acquirer is discouraged from offering to acquire Volt or prevented from successfully completing an acquisition by these or other measures, our shareholders could lose the opportunity to sell their shares at a more favorable price.", "PERMNO": 81190, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "VOLT"}
