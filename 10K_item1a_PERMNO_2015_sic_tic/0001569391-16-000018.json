{"cik": "1569391", "company": "KCG Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nA number of industry-related and other risks may adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of KCG. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to KCG also may adversely affect its business, financial condition and/or operating results in a material manner. In addition, KCG may be affected by general risks not directly related to its business, including, but not limited to, acts of war, terrorism and natural disasters. KCG cannot assure that the risks described below or elsewhere in this or its other reports filed or furnished with the SEC are a complete set of all potential risks KCG may face.\nConditions in the financial services industry and the securities markets may adversely affect KCG\u2019s trading volumes and market liquidity\nKCG\u2019s revenues are primarily transaction-based, and declines in global trading volumes, volatility levels, securities prices, commission rates or market liquidity could adversely affect KCG's business and its profitability. The level of activity in the markets in which KCG conducts business is directly affected by numerous national and international\nfactors that are beyond KCG\u2019s control, including economic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, legislative and regulatory changes, currency values and inflation, broad trends in business and finance and changes in the markets in which KCG\u2019s transactions occur. Declines in the trading volume of equities, fixed income and other financial instruments will generally result in lower revenues from market making and execution activities. Lower levels of volatility, which tends to correlate with trading volumes, will have the same directional impact. Lower price levels of securities and other instruments, as well as tighter spreads, may reduce profitability from trade executions. Increased competition can put pressure on commission rates, spreads and related fee schedules. Declines in market values of securities or other financial instruments can result in illiquid markets, which can increase the potential for losses on securities or other instruments held in inventory, the failure of buyers and sellers to fulfill their obligations and settle their trades, and increases in claims and litigation. Accordingly, reductions in trading volumes, volatility levels, securities prices, commission rates or market liquidity could materially affect KCG\u2019s business and profitability. As a result of the foregoing, period-to-period comparisons of KCG's revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful, and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nKCG trading activities expose it to the risk of significant losses\nKCG conducts the majority of its trading activities as principal, which subjects its capital to significant risks. These activities involve the purchase, sale or short sale of securities and other financial instruments for KCG\u2019s own account and, accordingly, involve risks of price fluctuations and illiquidity, or rapid changes in the liquidity of markets that may limit or restrict KCG\u2019s ability to either resell securities or other financial instruments KCG purchases or to repurchase securities or other financial instruments KCG sells in such transactions. From time to time, KCG may have large position concentrations in securities or other financial instruments of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry or segment, which could result in higher trading losses than would occur if KCG\u2019s positions and activities were less concentrated. The performance of KCG\u2019s trading activities primarily depends on its ability to attract order flow, the composition and profile of its order flow, the dollar value of securities and other financial instruments traded, the performance, size and volatility of KCG\u2019s market making portfolios, the performance, size and volatility of KCG\u2019s client and non-client principal trading activities (including high frequency trading), market interaction, the skill of KCG\u2019s trading personnel, the ability of KCG to design, build and effectively deploy the necessary technologies and operations to support all of its trading activities and enable KCG to remain competitive, general market conditions, effective hedging strategies and risk management processes, the price volatility of specific securities or other financial instruments, and the availability and allocation of capital. To attract order flow, KCG must be competitive on price, size of securities positions and other financial instruments traded, liquidity offerings, order execution speed, technology, reputation, payment for order flow and client relationships and service. In KCG\u2019s role as a market maker, it attempts to derive a profit from the difference between the prices at which it buys and sells securities. However, competitive forces and regulatory requirements often require KCG to match, or improve upon, the quotes other market makers display and to hold varying amounts of securities in inventory. By maintaining inventory positions, KCG is subject to a high degree of risk. There can be no assurance that KCG will be able to manage such risk successfully or that KCG will not experience significant losses from such activities. All of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nKCG is exposed to losses due to lack of perfect information\nAs a market maker, KCG provides liquidity by continuously buying securities from sellers and selling securities to buyers. KCG may at times trade with others who have different and possibly better information than it does, and as a result, KCG may accumulate unfavorable positions preceding large price movements in securities. Should the frequency or magnitude of these events increase, KCG\u2019s losses would likely increase correspondingly, which could have a material adverse effect on KCG's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nKCG\u2019s market making activities have been and may be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility\nCertain of KCG\u2019s market making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to KCG\u2019s clients, and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these activities. On the other hand, increased volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by Value-at-Risk, which KCG refers to as VaR, and may expose the Company to increased risks in connection with market making activities or cause KCG to reduce its market making positions in order to avoid increasing VaR. Limiting the size of KCG\u2019s market making positions can adversely affect profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be\npossible to do so at steep discounts. In such circumstances the Company may be forced to either take on additional risk or to incur losses in order to decrease KCG's VaR.\nThe valuation of the financial instruments KCG holds may result in large and occasionally anomalous swings in the value of its positions and in its earnings in any period\nThe market prices of KCG\u2019s long and short positions are reflected on its books at closing prices which are typically the last trade price before the official close of the primary exchange on which each such security trades. Given that KCG manages a globally integrated portfolio, it may have large and substantially offsetting positions in securities that trade on different exchanges that close at different times of the trading day. As a result, there may be large and occasionally anomalous swings in the value of KCG\u2019s positions daily and, accordingly, in its earnings in any period. This is especially true on the last business day of each calendar quarter.\nSubstantial competition could reduce KCG\u2019s market share and harm KCG\u2019s financial performance\nAll aspects of KCG\u2019s business are intensely competitive. KCG faces competition in its businesses primarily from global, national and regional broker dealers, exchanges, and ATSs. ATSs include crossing networks that match orders in private or without a public quote, ECNs that match orders off-exchange based on a displayed public quote, and dark liquidity pools which offer a variety of market models enabling investors to trade off-exchange. Equities competition is based on a number of factors, including KCG\u2019s execution standards (e.g., price, liquidity, speed and other client defined measures), client relationships and service, reputation, payment for order flow, market structure, product and service offerings, and technology. KCG will continue to face intense competition in connection with all of its trading activities, and KCG\u2019s ability to effectively compete will depend on a number of factors including its ability to design, build and effectively deploy the necessary technologies and operations to support all of its trading activities. A number of competitors of KCG\u2019s businesses may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than KCG. Some of KCG\u2019s competitors offer a wider range of services and financial products than KCG does and have greater name recognition and a more extensive client base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly than KCG to new or evolving opportunities and technologies, market changes and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and offer more business attractive terms to clients including larger order flow rebate payments. Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties or may consolidate to enhance their services and products. It is possible that new competitors, or alliances among competitors, may also emerge, and they may acquire significant market share. The trend toward increased competition in KCG\u2019s businesses is expected to continue and it is possible that KCG\u2019s competitors may acquire increased market share.\nAs a result of the above, there can be no assurance that KCG will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nKCG may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other changes or adequately protect its intellectual property\nThe markets in which KCG competes are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing client demands. If KCG is not able to keep up with these rapid changes on a timely and cost-effective basis, it may be at a competitive disadvantage. The widespread adoption of new internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require KCG to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its services or infrastructure. Any failure by KCG to anticipate or respond adequately to technological advancements (including advancements related to telecommunications, data transfer, execution and messaging speeds), client requirements or changing industry standards or to adequately protect its intellectual property, or any delays in the development, introduction or availability of new services, products or enhancements, could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, the success of KCG and its subsidiaries has largely been attributable to its sophisticated proprietary technology that has taken many years to develop. KCG has benefited from the fact that the type of proprietary technology it employs has not been widely available to its competitors. If KCG\u2019s technology becomes more widely available to its current or future competitors for any reason, KCG\u2019s operating results may be adversely affected.\nKCG uses trademark, trade secret, copyright and other proprietary rights and procedures to protect its intellectual property and technology resources. Despite its efforts, monitoring unauthorized use of KCG\u2019s intellectual property is\ndifficult and costly, and KCG cannot be certain that the steps it takes to prevent unauthorized use of its proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of its technology, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, KCG cannot be sure that courts will adequately enforce contractual arrangements KCG has entered into to protect its proprietary technologies. If any of KCG\u2019s proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to its competitors, its competitive position could be adversely affected. KCG may incur substantial costs to defend ownership of its intellectual property or to replace misappropriated proprietary technology. If a third party were to assert a claim of infringement of KCG\u2019s proprietary rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against KCG with respect to one or more of its methods of doing business or conducting its operations, KCG could be required to spend significant amounts to defend such claims, develop alternative methods of operations, pay substantial money damages or obtain a license from the third party.\nKCG may experience disasters or business disruptions\nKCG has business continuity capabilities that could be utilized in the event of a disaster or disruption. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, KCG must be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope. A disruption might only affect KCG, a building that KCG occupies, a business district in which KCG is located, a city in which KCG is located or an entire region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. KCG\u2019s business continuity facilities are designed to allow it to substantially continue operations if KCG is prevented from accessing or utilizing its primary offices for an extended period of time. Although KCG has employed significant effort to develop, implement and maintain reasonable business continuity plans, KCG cannot ensure that its systems will properly or fully recover after a significant business disruption in a timely fashion. If KCG is prevented from using any of its current trading operations or any third party services, or if its business continuity operations do not work effectively, KCG may not have complete business continuity. This could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nKCG will incur risks in connection with the move of its corporate headquarters and the migration of its data center\nKCG is planning to move its corporate headquarters from Jersey City, New Jersey to downtown New York City in 2016, and its Jersey City data center operations to other commercial data centers and colocations by the end of April 2018. As part of these moves, KCG's existing New York City office at One Liberty Plaza will also be moved to the new headquarters location. As with every move of this magnitude, there are a number of risks involved that could have a potential negative impact on KCG\u2019s operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, missing project timelines (which could have the potential for disruption of market making or trading services or other operations), risks related to changes to office infrastructure and technology, and unexpected costs associated with the relocation. The diversion of business, technology and management attention from other business concerns and a multitude of external factors also pose a risk. While KCG employs a significant amount of internal and external resources to mitigate these and other risks associated with the relocation, they could have an adverse impact on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results.\nRegulatory and legal uncertainties could harm KCG\u2019s business\nThe capital markets industry in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which KCG conducts its business is subject to extensive oversight under federal, state and applicable foreign laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules of SROs. Broker dealers, investment advisors and financial services firms are subject to regulations concerning all aspects of their businesses, including, but not limited to, trade practices, best execution practices, capital adequacy, record-keeping, anti-money laundering, fair and requisite disclosure and the conduct of their officers, supervisors and employees. KCG\u2019s operations and profitability may be directly affected by, among other things, additional legislation or regulation, or changes in rules promulgated by domestic or foreign governments or regulators; and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, regulations and rules. Failure to comply with these laws, rules or regulations could result in, among other things, administrative actions or court proceedings, censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or injunctions, loss of membership, or the suspension or disqualification of the market participant or broker dealer, and/or their officers, supervisors or employees. Furthermore, domestic and foreign stock exchanges, other SROs and state and foreign securities commissions can censure, fine and issue cease-and-desist orders to suspend or expel a broker-dealer or other market participant or any of its officers or employees. In recent years, the size of penalties and fees sought by regulators has increased significantly. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could also negatively impact KCG\u2019s reputation, client relationships, prospects, revenues and\nearnings.\nKCG\u2019s ability to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules is largely dependent on its internal systems to ensure compliance, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel. Each of KCG\u2019s regulators engages in a series of periodic and special examinations and investigations to monitor compliance with such laws, rules and regulations that may result in disciplinary actions in the future due to alleged noncompliance. KCG is currently the subject of regulatory reviews and investigations that may, in the future, result in disciplinary actions, including the imposition of fines and penalties due to alleged non-compliance.\nFederal, state and foreign legislators, regulators and SROs are constantly proposing, or enacting, new regulations which may impact KCG\u2019s business. These include rules regarding, among others, a CAT designed to improve the ability of the SEC and others to oversee trading in the U.S. securities markets, private or over-the-counter markets, sometimes referred to as dark liquidity pools, increased transaction and other fees, transaction taxes, enhanced requirements regarding market access (including SEC Rule15c3-5) and for technology testing and implementation, increased obligations for market makers, higher capital requirements, and order routing limitations. Additionally, Section 31 fees are reviewed regularly. These fees could increase substantially in the future in order to recover the costs incurred by the government, including the SEC, for supervising and regulating the securities markets.\nRegulators may also consider proposing other market structure changes. Following the market events of May 6, 2010, both the SEC and the CFTC issued concept releases seeking public comment on certain market structure issues such as high frequency trading, the colocation of servers with exchange matching engines, off-exchange trading, including internalization where brokers match orders with their own inventory, and markets that do not publicly display price quotations including dark liquidity pools. In particular, high frequency trading continues to be a controversial feature of modern markets and regulatory scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulators and SROs is likely to continue, as evidenced by SEC Chair White\u2019s June 5, 2014 speech. Market participants continue to call upon the U.S. Congress and the SEC to make changes to limit high-frequency trading and these changes could impact KCG\u2019s business negatively.\nIn addition, the financial services industry in many foreign countries is heavily regulated, much like in the U.S. The varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit KCG\u2019s ability to conduct business or expand internationally. Further, public debate in Europe regarding high-frequency trading is leading policymakers to consider laws and regulations that may impact KCG\u2019s business, including potential taxes, limits on order-to-execution ratios and requirements for country-specific authorization for high frequency traders. To continue to operate and to expand its services internationally, KCG will have to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which it conducts or intends to conduct business, the requirements of which may not be clearly defined. The varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions, which are often unclear, may limit KCG's ability to continue existing international operations and further expand internationally.\nAny of these laws, rules or regulations, if adopted, as well as any regulatory or legal actions or proceedings, changes in legislation or regulation, and changes in market customs and practices could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, changes in current laws or regulations or in governmental policies could negatively impact KCG\u2019s operations, revenues and earnings.\nAt any given time, KCG may be the subject of one or more regulatory or SRO enforcement actions. KCG\u2019s business or reputation could be negatively impacted if it were determined that disciplinary or other enforcement actions were required.\nKCG\u2019s business is subject to substantial risk from litigation, regulatory investigations and rules and regulations\nMany aspects of KCG\u2019s business involve substantial risks of liability. KCG is exposed to potential liability under federal, state and foreign securities laws, other federal, state and foreign laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by U.S. and foreign regulators. KCG is also subject to the risk of potential litigation. From time to time, KCG and its subsidiaries and certain of their past and present officers, directors and employees, are, or may be in the future, named as parties in legal actions, regulatory investigations and proceedings, arbitrations and administrative claims. KCG has been the subject of claims alleging the violation of such laws, rules and regulations, some of which have resulted in the payment of fines, awards, judgments and settlements. Moreover, KCG may be required to indemnify past and present officers, directors and employees in regards to these matters. Certain corporate events, such as a reduction in KCG\u2019s workforce, could also result in additional litigation or arbitration. KCG could incur significant legal expenses in defending such litigations or proceedings. An adverse resolution of any current or future\nlawsuits, legal or regulatory proceedings or claims against KCG could have a material adverse effect on its business and reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nRules governing specialists and designated market makers may require KCG to make unprofitable trades or prevent KCG from making profitable trades\nSpecialists and designated market makers are granted certain rights and have certain obligations to \"make a market\" in a particular security. They agree to specific obligations to maintain a fair and orderly market. In acting as a specialist or designated market maker, KCG is subjected to a high degree of risk by having to support an orderly market. In this role, KCG may at times be required to make trades that adversely affect its profitability. In addition, KCG may at times be unable to trade for its own account in circumstances in which it may be to its advantage to trade, and KCG may be obligated to act as a principal when buyers or sellers outnumber each other. In those instances, KCG may take a position counter to the market, buying or selling securities to support an orderly market. Additionally, the rules of the markets which govern KCG\u2019s activities as a specialist or designated market maker are subject to change. If these rules are made more stringent, KCG\u2019s trading revenues and profits as specialist or designated market maker could be adversely affected.\nKCG\u2019s reliance on computer systems and software, including third-party systems, could adversely affect its business\nKCG relies significantly on its computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data and utilize such data to generate orders and other messages. This includes certain third-party computer systems or third-party service providers, including clearing systems, exchange systems, internet service, communications facilities and other facilities. A disruption or corruption of the proper functioning of KCG\u2019s computer systems or software, or deterioration in their performance, could be disruptive to KCG\u2019s business. KCG cannot guarantee that its efforts to maintain competitive computer systems and software will be successful. Although KCG has implemented, and continues to implement, technological changes to prevent the failure of its computer systems and software, KCG\u2019s computer systems and software may nonetheless fail or be subject to bugs or other errors, resulting in service interruptions or other unintended consequences. Additionally, if KCG\u2019s arrangement with any third party is terminated, KCG may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapacity constraints, systems failures and delays could harm KCG\u2019s business\nKCG\u2019s business activities are heavily dependent on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting them and the services of certain third parties. KCG\u2019s systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, technological or operational failures, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism and other similar events. The nature of KCG\u2019s businesses involves a high volume of transactions made in rapid fashion which could result in certain errors being repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Extraordinary trading volumes or other events could cause KCG\u2019s computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. KCG\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nWhile KCG has invested significant amounts of capital to upgrade the capacity, reliability, scalability and speed of its systems, there can be no assurance that its systems will be sufficient to handle current or future trading volumes, and the modifications themselves may result in unanticipated and undesirable consequences. Although KCG will continually update and modify its trading software in response to changes in its business, rule changes and for various other reasons, there are no assurances that such updates and modifications to KCG\u2019s trading software will not result in future trading losses. Many of KCG\u2019s systems are, and much of its infrastructure is, designed to accommodate additional growth without material redesign or replacement; however, KCG may need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth. Failure to make necessary expansions and upgrades to its systems and infrastructure, including any inability to develop and upgrade existing technology, transaction-processing systems or network infrastructure to accommodate increased sales volume through KCG\u2019s transaction-processing systems, could lead to unanticipated system disruptions, slower response time, degradation in levels of customer service and impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment.\nFrom time to time, KCG has reimbursed its clients for losses incurred in connection with systems failures and delays. Capacity constraints, systems failures and delays may occur in the future and could cause, among other things, unanticipated problems with KCG\u2019s trading or operating systems, disruptions in its client and non-client market making activities, disruptions in service to its clients, slower system response times resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as KCG\u2019s clients desire, decreased levels of client service and client satisfaction, and harm to KCG\u2019s reputation. If any of these events were to occur, KCG could suffer substantial financial losses, loss of clients or reduction in the growth of its client base, increased operating expenses, litigation, arbitration or other client claims and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens.\nKCG may be the target of a significant cyber-attack or threat that impairs internal systems or causes reputational damage\nKCG relies heavily on technology and automation to perform many functions within the firm. This reliance on technology opens the firm to various forms of cyber-attacks; including data loss or destruction, unauthorized access, unavailability of service or the introduction of malicious code.\nKCG has taken significant steps to mitigate the various cyber threats, and devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and networks and reviews the ever changing threat landscape. KCG has created a dedicated Information Security Group, created and filled the role of Information Security Officer (\u201cISO\u201d) and formed an Information Security Steering Committee. In addition, the firm has enhanced the communication channels with government and law enforcement agencies for better information sharing and awareness. The firm will continue to periodically review policies and procedures to ensure they are effective in mitigating current cyber and other information security threats. In addition to the policy reviews, the firm continues to look to implement technology solutions that enhance preventive and detection capabilities, and has an Emergency Management Plan (\u201cEMP\u201d) that sets forth procedures for firm-wide crisis responses, including in the case of a cyber-attack. See \u201cOperational Risks\u201d under \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.\nNotwithstanding these efforts, KCG\u2019s cybersecurity measures may not detect or prevent all attempts to compromise its systems, including denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted by KCG\u2019s systems or that it otherwise maintains. Breaches of KCG\u2019s cybersecurity measures could result in any of the following: unauthorized access to KCG\u2019s systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of information or data, including confidential or proprietary information about ourselves, third parties with whom KCG does business or its proprietary systems; viruses, worms, spyware or other malware being placed in KCG\u2019s systems; deletion or modification of client information; or a denial-of-service or other interruptions to KCG's business operations. Although KCG devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and networks and review the ever changing threat landscape, the methods of attack change frequently, with many vulnerabilities not publicly known until the very point in time when they are exploited. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against KCG or its third-party service providers, KCG may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate protections in advance.\nThe current measures by KCG or any other measures cannot prevent every potential threat. Although KCG maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. Any actual or perceived breach of KCG\u2019s cybersecurity could damage its reputation, expose it to a risk of loss, regulatory action or litigation and possible liability, require it to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such breaches and otherwise have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe use of open source software may expose KCG to additional risks\nKCG uses software development tools covered by open source licenses and may incorporate such open source software into its proprietary software from time to time. \"Open source software\" refers to any code, shareware or other software that is made generally available to the public without requiring payment of fees or royalties and/or that may require disclosure or licensing of any software that incorporates such source code, shareware or other software. Given the nature of open source software, third parties might assert contractual or copyright and other intellectual property-related claims against KCG based on its use of such tools and software programs or might seek to compel the disclosure of the source code of its software or other proprietary information. If any such claims materialize, KCG could be required to (i) seek licenses from third parties in order to continue to use such tools and software or to continue to operate certain elements of KCG's technology, (ii) release certain proprietary software code comprising KCG's modifications\nto such open source software, (iii) make KCG\u2019s software available under the terms of an open source license or (iv) re-engineer all, or a portion of, that software, any of which could materially and adversely affect KCG's business, financial condition and results of operations. While KCG monitors the use of all open source software in its solutions, processes and technology and seeks to ensure that no open source software is used (i) in such a way as to require KCG to disclose the source code to the related solution when it does not wish to do so nor (ii) in connection with critical or fundamental elements of its software or technology, such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying KCG's proprietary solutions. If a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software KCG licenses from such third party for its products and solutions, KCG could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to its solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could potentially have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nKCG may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies\nKCG seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While KCG employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, KCG may, in the course of its activities, incur losses.\nKCG\u2019s failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could cause investors to lose confidence in its financial statements and have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business and stock price\nKCG devotes considerable resources, including management\u2019s time and other internal resources, to complying with regulatory requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As such, KCG could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, which may have a material adverse effect on its stock price.\nSelf-clearing exposes KCG to significant operational, financial and liquidity risks\nKCG self-clears substantially all of its domestic and international equities transactions using proprietary platforms and may expand self-clearing across product offerings and asset classes in the future. Self-clearing requires KCG to finance the majority of its inventory and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations. Self-clearing exposes KCG\u2019s business to operational risks, including business and technology disruption, operational inefficiencies, liquidity and financing risks and potentially increased expenses and lost revenue opportunities. While KCG\u2019s clearing platform, operational processes, enhanced infrastructure and current and future financing arrangements have been carefully designed, KCG may nevertheless encounter difficulties that may lead to operating inefficiencies, including technology issues, dissatisfaction amongst KCG\u2019s client base, disruption in the infrastructure that supports the business, inadequate liquidity, increased margin requirements with clearing organizations and counterparties who provide financing with respect to inventories, reductions in available borrowing capacity and financial loss. Any such delay, disruption, expense or failure could adversely affect KCG\u2019s ability to effect transactions and manage its exposure to risk. Moreover, any of these events could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nKCG could lose significant sources of revenues if it loses any of its larger clients\nAt times, a limited number of clients could account for a significant portion of KCG\u2019s order flow, revenues and profitability, and KCG expects a large portion of the future demand for, and profitability from, its trade execution services to remain concentrated within a limited number of clients. The loss of one or more larger clients could have an adverse effect on KCG\u2019s revenues and profitability in the future.\nNone of KCG\u2019s clients is currently contractually obligated to utilize KCG for trade execution services and, accordingly, these clients may direct their trade execution activities to other execution providers or market centers at\nany time. Some of these clients have grown organically or acquired market makers and specialist firms to internalize order flow or will have entered into strategic relationships with competitors. There can be no assurance that KCG will be able to retain these major clients or that such clients will maintain or increase their demand for KCG\u2019s trade execution services. Further, the continued integration of legacy systems could result in disruption to KCG\u2019s ongoing businesses and relationships or cause issues with standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of KCG to maintain relationships with customers, or to solicit new customers. The loss, or a significant reduction, of demand for KCG\u2019s services from any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nKCG is highly dependent on key personnel\nKCG is highly dependent on a limited number of key personnel. KCG\u2019s success is dependent to a large degree on its ability to retain the services of its existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. Competition for such personnel is intense. The loss of the services of any of KCG\u2019s key executives or the inability to identify, hire and retain necessary highly qualified executive management in the future could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nKCG\u2019s success also depends, in part, on the highly skilled, and often specialized, individuals KCG employs. KCG\u2019s ability to attract and retain management, trading, market making, sales and technology professionals, as well as quantitative analysts and programmers is important to KCG\u2019s business strategy. KCG strives to provide high quality services that allow it to establish and maintain long-term relationships with its clients. KCG\u2019s ability to do so depends, in large part, upon the individual employees who represent KCG in its dealings with such clients. KCG may lose such professionals due to increased competition or other factors in the future, or such professionals may leave KCG voluntarily. The loss of sales, trading or technology professionals, particularly senior professionals with broad industry or technical expertise and long-term relationships with clients, could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nInternational activities involve certain risks\nKCG\u2019s international operations expose it to financial, cultural, regulatory and governmental risks, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies' transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against designated foreign states, organizations and individuals.\nApproximately 13% of the revenue of KCG in 2015, resulted from international operations. The financial services industry in many foreign countries is heavily regulated, much like the U.S., but differences, whether cultural, legal or otherwise, do exist. KCG is exposed to risks and uncertainties, including political, economic and financial instability, changes in requirements, exchange rate fluctuations, staffing challenges and the requisite controls needed to manage such operations. To continue to operate and expand its services globally, KCG will have to comply with the unique legal and regulatory controls of each country in which it conducts, or intends to conduct business, the requirements of which may be onerous or may not be clearly defined. The varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit KCG\u2019s ability to successfully conduct or expand its business internationally. It may increase KCG\u2019s costs of investment. Additionally, operating international locations involves both execution and reputational risk. KCG may not be able to manage these costs or risks effectively.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect KCG\u2019s earnings\nA significant portion of KCG\u2019s international business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on KCG\u2019s financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non-U.S. dollar assets with borrowings in the same currency and the use of various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. Any material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our operating results.\nKCG has leverage\nIn March 2015, KCG issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Secured Notes (the \u201c6.875% Senior Secured Notes\u201d). As a result of KCG's history of debt offerings including the 6.875% Senior Secured Notes, KCG has leverage. This leverage may have important negative consequences for KCG and its stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring it to dedicate a portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult for KCG to optimally manage the cash flow for its businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which it operates;\n\u2022\nplacing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nsubjecting it to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds, and make capital expenditures and other investments, and\n\u2022\nexposing it to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement.\nKCG\u2019s ability to make payments of the principal on and refinance its indebtedness will depend on its future performance, its ability to generate cash flow and market conditions, each of which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond its control. KCG\u2019s business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service its debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If KCG is unable to generate such cash flow, it may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, undertaking additional borrowings or issuing additional debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive to current shareholders. KCG\u2019s ability to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness will depend on KCG's financial condition and its ability to access the capital markets and the credit markets. KCG may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in increased financing costs or a default on its debt obligations.\nKCG may be unable to remain in compliance with the financial maintenance and other affirmative and negative covenants contained in its debt instruments and the obligation to comply with such covenants may adversely affect its ability to operate its business\nKCG\u2019s current debt instruments contain financial maintenance and other affirmative and negative covenants that impose significant requirements on KCG and limit its ability to engage in certain transactions or activities. In addition, in the future KCG may enter into other debt instruments with covenants different from, and potentially more onerous than KCG's current debt facilities. These covenants could limit KCG\u2019s flexibility in managing its businesses. In the event that KCG is unable to either comply with these restrictions and other covenants or obtain waivers from its lenders, KCG would be in default under these debt instruments and, among other things, the repayment of KCG\u2019s debt could be accelerated by its lenders. In such case, KCG might not be able to repay its debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance its debt on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms that are acceptable to KCG, resulting in a default on its debt obligations, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\nKCG\u2019s outstanding senior secured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary exceptions, qualifications and \u201cbaskets\u201d which provide KCG exceptions to certain of the negative covenant restrictions on its business up to certain specified amounts. The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on indebtedness, liens, hedging agreements, investments, loans and advances, asset sales, mergers and acquisitions, dividends, transactions with affiliates, prepayments of other indebtedness, modifications of organizational documents and other material agreements, restrictions on subsidiaries, capital expenditures, issuance and repurchases of capital stock, negative pledges and business activities.\nKCG may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish its ability to make payments on its indebtedness when due, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with its current level of indebtedness\nDespite KCG\u2019s indebtedness level and the negative covenants contained in the senior secured notes, KCG may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future. KCG is not fully restricted under the terms of the indenture for the senior secured notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing KCG\u2019s debt or taking a number of other actions, including certain additional indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business by KCG\u2019s broker dealer subsidiaries and certain other regulated subsidiaries, any of which additional indebtedness could diminish KCG\u2019s ability to make payments on its indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with KCG\u2019s current level of indebtedness. If new debt is added to KCG\u2019s or any of its existing and future subsidiaries' current debt, the related risks that KCG now faces could intensify.\nKCG\u2019s reported financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates\nKCG\u2019s accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to its reported financial condition and results of operations. KCG\u2019s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report KCG\u2019s financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in KCG reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting KCG\u2019s reported financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. If such estimates or assumptions underlying KCG\u2019s financial statements are incorrect, KCG may experience material losses.\nIn November 2013, KCG restated certain legacy historical financial statements of GETCO. As a result of these restatements, KCG's management concluded that there were material weaknesses in GETCO's financial statement preparation processes and the related disclosure controls for the period leading up to the Mergers. Any future restatements or corrections of errors may result in a loss of investor confidence in KCG\u2019s financial reporting.\nAdditionally, from time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of KCG\u2019s financial statements. These changes are beyond KCG\u2019s control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how KCG reports its financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring, and given the current economic environment, more drastic changes may occur. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExposure to credit risk may adversely affect KCG\u2019s results of operations\nKCG will be at risk if issuers whose securities or other instruments KCG holds, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under derivative contracts, financing agreements or repurchase and equity finance agreements, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses, custodians or other financial intermediaries or guarantors default on their obligations to KCG, fail to perform under their agreements with KCG or are precluded to perform their obligations due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, legal or regulatory issues, fraud or other reasons. Although KCG engages in hedging and other risk management processes in order to mitigate these risks, KCG may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract or may be prevented from entering into an offsetting contract in order to cover the risk of such defaults or failures, and such defaults or failures could nonetheless result in financial losses for KCG and could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Notwithstanding KCG\u2019s ability to enter into an offsetting contract, KCG may still suffer financial losses as a result of a counterparty\u2019s default resulting from these issues.\nKCG conducts the majority of its trade executions as principal or riskless-principal with broker dealers, financial services firms and institutional counterparties. KCG self-clears a considerable portion of its trade executions, which requires that KCG compare and match trades, record all transaction details, finance inventory and maintain deposits with clearing organizations, rather than rely upon an outside party to provide those services. When KCG self-clears its securities transactions, it is required to hold the securities subject to those transactions until the transactions settle,\nwhich typically occurs three trading days following the date of execution of the transaction. During the period of time from the execution to the settlement of a securities transaction, the securities to be transferred in the transaction may incur a significant change in value or the counterparty to the transaction may become insolvent, may default on its obligation to settle the transaction or may otherwise become unable to comply with its securities financing contractual obligations, resulting in potential losses to KCG. KCG is also exposed to credit risk from its counterparties when it self-clears securities transactions and when it clears securities transactions through an unaffiliated clearing broker, the latter of which is the case with a minority of KCG\u2019s trade executions. Counterparty credit risk relates to both the deposits held with clearing organizations and instances where a trade might have failed, or be contested, adjusted or generally deviate from the terms understood at the time of execution. Under the terms of the agreements between KCG and its clearing brokers, the clearing brokers have the right to charge KCG for losses that result from a counterparty\u2019s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. No assurance can be given that any such counterparty will not default on its obligations, which default could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough KCG has procedures for reviewing credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee, including rapid changes in securities, commodity and foreign exchange price levels, or operational, legal or regulatory risks applicable to such customers or counterparties. Even if KCG\u2019s credit review and analysis procedures work properly, KCG may experience financial losses in dealings with such parties. Some of KCG\u2019s risk management methods also depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by KCG. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect KCG. KCG may be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default by any of its customers or counterparties.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments, divestitures and other strategic relationships involve certain risks\nKCG is the product of strategic relationships and acquisitions, and it may continue to pursue opportunistic strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or divestitures of businesses and technologies. Acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including difficulties in assessing values for acquired businesses, intangible assets and technologies, difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, employee retention issues, assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the potential writedown of goodwill due to impairment, which could reduce future reported earnings, or result in potential loss of clients and/or key employees of acquired companies. KCG may not be able to integrate successfully certain operations, personnel, services or products that it has acquired or may acquire in the future.\nAs KCG has sought to refocus on its core strategies, it has shutdown, reconstituted or disposed of several non-core businesses, including its reverse mortgage origination and securitization business, its FCM business and KCG Hotspot. In addition, in February 2016, KCGA entered into an asset purchase agreement with Citadel, pursuant to which KCGA agreed to sell its NYSE DMM business to Citadel. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016. Additional divestitures are possible in the future and may have a material impact on KCG\u2019s balance sheet or results of operations. KCG may not be able to replace the revenue generated by any divested business. Divestitures generally also entail numerous risks. The divestiture of an existing business could reduce KCG\u2019s future operating cash flows and revenues, make its financial results more volatile, and/or cause a decline in revenues and profits. A divestiture could also cause a decline in the price of KCG Class A Common Stock and increased reliance on other elements of its core business operations. In addition, the agreements to sell any divested businesses may require KCG to indemnify the buyer in certain situations. If KCG does not successfully manage the risks associated with a divestiture, its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. KCG also may not find suitable purchasers for businesses it may wish to divest. In addition, the decision to pursue acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions may jeopardize KCG\u2019s ability to retain the services of its existing key employees and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future.\nStrategic investments also entail some of the other risks described above. If these investments are unsuccessful, KCG may need to incur charges against earnings. KCG may build and establish a number of strategic relationships. These relationships and others KCG may enter into in the future may be important to its business and growth prospects. KCG may not be able to maintain these relationships or develop new strategic alliances.\nKCG may incur risks in connection with the further integration of GETCO and Knight\nAlthough the major steps in integrating Knight and GETCO are complete, there remain certain aspects of the businesses of GETCO and Knight that operate separately. If KCG is not able to successfully integrate these operations, the anticipated benefits of the Mergers may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. Business combinations involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operation, systems, controls and technologies of the companies and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. The continued integration of GETCO and Knight may require KCG to incur significant cost in connection with, among other things, implementing financial and operating systems, and integrating technology platforms, which could have a material adverse effect on KCG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditional remedial steps may be required in connection with the events of August 1, 2012\nKnight experienced a technology issue at the opening of trading at the NYSE on August 1, 2012. This issue was related to its installation of trading software and resulted in Knight\u2019s broker dealer subsidiary, Knight Capital Americas LLC (\"KCA\"), sending numerous erroneous orders in NYSE-listed and NYSE Arca securities into the market. Although this software was subsequently removed from Knight\u2019s systems and the software issue was limited to the routing of certain NYSE-listed stocks, it resulted in Knight realizing a pre-tax loss including related legal and professional fees of approximately $468.1 million. As a result of the technology issue, Knight implemented various remedial measures, including those at the direction of its regulators and, retained an independent consultant. Although remediation is in the final stages, KCG may incur additional expenses in implementing further technical changes and remedial measures which may be required or otherwise necessary or advisable. Further, these potential additional remedial steps may be burdensome to KCG\u2019s business operations or costly to complete and there is no guarantee that the remedial steps taken by KCG will satisfy any applicable regulatory requirements imposed in connection with the technology issue.\nKCG is a holding company and depends on its subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments\nKCG is a legal entity separate and distinct from its broker dealer and other subsidiaries. KCG\u2019s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, will be dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends or distributions by regulated subsidiaries, such as broker dealers. If KCG\u2019s subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to it and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, KCG may not be able to make principal and interest payments on its outstanding debt and could default on its debt obligations. In addition, KCG\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nKCG\u2019s two largest stockholders own a substantial percentage of KCG\u2019s Class A Common Stock, which could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters or result in actions that the other stockholders do not believe to be in KCG\u2019s interests or their interests\nAs of February 24, 2016, KCG\u2019s two largest stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 40% of KCG\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Stock (including restricted stock units) (or 39%, assuming exercise of all KCG warrants outstanding) based on the most recent Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 4s filed by the holders. As a result, these large stockholders may be able to exert influence over KCG\u2019s affairs and policies, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions and other extraordinary transactions. In addition, one of the largest stockholders has representation on KCG\u2019s Board of Directors. This concentrated control could limit the ability of the remaining stockholders to influence corporate matters, and the interests of the large stockholders may not coincide with KCG\u2019s interests or the interests of the remaining stockholders. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of KCG, could deprive KCG\u2019s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of KCG and might ultimately affect the market price of KCG\u2019s common stock.\nThese large stockholders may in the future seek to sell large portions of KCG Class A Common Stock in one or a series of related transactions, including through block trades, 10b5-1 sales plans or underwritten secondary offerings. In connection with the Mergers, one of these stockholders was granted registration rights, which, subject to certain limitations, require KCG to assist such stockholder in conducting one or more registered offerings of all or a portion of its holdings. Any significant sales of KCG Class A Common Stock or any market perception of future sales of KCG Class A Common Stock may result in a decrease in the trading price of KCG\u2019s Class A Common Stock.\nShares of KCG Class A Common Stock are subject to dilution as a result of exercise of the warrants\nThe shares of KCG Class A Common Stock are subject to dilution upon exercise of KCG\u2019s warrants. Approximately 21.6 million shares of KCG Class A Common Stock may be issued in connection with exercise of the warrants. These warrants have exercise prices ranging from $11.70 to $14.63 and terms of between four and six years, with the first expiration occurring on July 1, 2017. The warrants may be exercised at any time, even if the current market price of the KCG Class A Common Stock is below the applicable exercise price. As the expiration date for any class of warrants approaches, the likelihood of exercise increases.\nThe market price of KCG Class A Common Stock will likely be influenced by the warrants. For example, the market price of KCG Class A Common Stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by investors\u2019 anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of KCG Class A Common Stock received upon exercise of the warrants. This effect may be more significant as the expiration date for a class of warrants approaches.\nThe market price of KCG\u2019s common stock could fluctuate significantly\nThe U.S. securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. If the market price of KCG Class A Common Stock fluctuates significantly, KCG may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. KCG\u2019s future quarterly operating results may not consistently meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of KCG Class A Common Stock.\nCertain additional payments to be made to KCG in connection with the sale of KCG Hotspot are uncertain\nThe sale of KCG Hotspot is structured as a taxable asset sale and BATS Global Markets, Inc. (\"BATS\") and KCG have agreed to share certain related tax benefits that potentially accrue to BATS after the closing of the transaction. KCG will share in 70% of the actual tax benefits to BATS for the first three years after the closing and 50% of the actual tax benefits thereafter (the \u201cAnnual Tax Benefits\u201d). However, KCG has a one-time option exercisable within 30 days of the third anniversary of the closing of the transaction to terminate the continued tax sharing arrangement in exchange for a one-time payment of $50 million, which BATS has the right to exercise after KCG\u2019s option expires.\nHowever, the receipt of the Annual Tax Benefits by KCG is subject to BATS having sufficient net income to receive the tax benefits. BATS\u2019s net income could decrease due to numerous factors, which are outside of the control of KCG. In addition, any decrease in the corporate tax rates applicable to BATS could reduce the size or certainty of the Annual Tax Benefits.\nKCG may not pay dividends\nKCG does not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the KCG Board of Directors and will depend, upon among other factors, KCG\u2019s cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments and credit facilities, earnings and legal considerations. If KCG does not pay dividends, then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price. There is no guarantee that KCG Class A Common Stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value.", "PERMNO": 13998, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "KCG"}
