{"cik": "878526", "company": "NATUS MEDICAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.\nOn January 15, 2019 Natus announced the implementation of a new organizational structure, \u201cOne Natus,\u201d designed to improve operational performance and make it a stronger, more profitable company. While the implementation is substantially complete, there can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this new structure. Our financial goals assume a level of increased productivity. If we are unable to deliver these expected improvements, or continue to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change require additional resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth in prior years has depended substantially on the completion of acquisitions and we may not be able to complete acquisitions of the same nature or relative size in the future to support a similar level of growth.\nThe acquisitions that we have completed have contributed to our growth in prior years. We have expended considerable effort in seeking to identify attractive acquisition candidates, and ultimately, to negotiate mutually agreeable acquisition terms.\nThe market for attractive acquisitions is competitive and others with different strategic objectives or greater financial resources than we have may be better positioned than we are to acquire desirable targets. Further, we may not be able to negotiate acquisition terms with target companies that will allow us to achieve acceptable financial returns from the transaction.\nIf we do not remediate a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct an annual comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. Further, each year our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Immaterial errors identified as part of the closing of our books for the fourth quarter 2019 indicated certain deficiencies existed in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we did not have controls designed to identify and properly account for certain research and development activities related to an arrangement with a third party. Additionally, insufficient training provided to a new control operator and the design of one of our controls over payroll accounts contributed to an error in the period end accrual. The Company has concluded that these deficiencies could have resulted in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis, and as such, these control deficiencies result in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness is more fully described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures-Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The existence of this material weakness and of any other ineffective controls over our financial reporting could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022Revision of previously filed financial statements;\n\u2022Failure to meet our reporting obligations;\n\u2022Loss of investor confidence; and\n\u2022Negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nA material weakness is defined under the standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nWe reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to missing controls over a significant business combination, which we remediated in 2018. Separate from the material weakness identified for the year ended December 31, 2017, during the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with a change in control owner, management identified an existing control that was not designed at a sufficient precision to adequately review our analysis of separate reporting units, which could have resulted in a material misstatement. Although we took steps to remediate both these issues in 2018 and believe both material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31, 2018, these measures may not be sufficient to avoid similar weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we identified errors as part of closing our books and concluded that certain deficiencies existed in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we did not have controls designed to identify and properly account for certain research and development activities related to an arrangement with a third party. Additionally, insufficient training provided to a new control operator and the design of one of our controls over payroll accounts contributed to an error in the period end accrual. The Company has concluded that these deficiencies could have resulted in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis, and as such, these control deficiencies resulted in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We plan to make substantive changes to enhance our design of controls intended to identify and assess contracts that include research and development and to aid in confirming the accuracy of the payroll accrual accounts. There can be no assurances that these remediation steps will be successful.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If other material weaknesses are identified in the future or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could be restated, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our controls from our independent registered accounting firm and we could be subject to\ninvestigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, and the market price of our stock could decline.\nOur operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing, acquiring, and marketing additional products or improving our existing products.\nWe intend to develop additional products and technologies, including enhancements of existing products, for the screening, detection, treatment, monitoring and tracking of common medical ailments. Developing new products and improving our existing products to meet the needs of current and future customers requires significant investments in research and development. Healthcare products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials, which can be time consuming and expensive. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials may adversely affect our ability to secure marketing authorization for certain products. Furthermore, all results, even positive ones, are subject to the interpretation of FDA and other regulatory agencies. If we fail to sell new products, update existing products, or timely react to changes in technology, our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles.\nAdverse economic conditions in markets in which we operate may harm our business.\nUnfavorable changes in U.S. and international economic environments may adversely affect our business and financial results. Concerns over the economic stability, the level of U.S. national debt, currency fluctuations and volatility, the rate of growth of Japan, China, and other Asian economies, unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, inflation levels, trade relations, energy costs and geopolitical uncertainty have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. During challenging economic times, and in tight credit markets, our customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures. This could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition, all of which could impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we expect these factors will cause us to be more cautious in evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, which could hinder our ability to grow through acquisition while these conditions persist.\nIn addition, we are susceptible to risks related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in China and its spread to other countries. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could adversely affect our operations, including our manufacturing and supply chain and sales and marketing. Parts of our direct and indirect supply chain are in China, and are accordingly subject to disruption or product contamination. Additionally, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 or any other epidemic harms our business or the economy in general either in China or in any other region in which we do business. For example, our customers may delay, cancel or redirect planned capital expenditures in order to focus resources on COVID-19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID-19. The extent to which COVID-19 affected our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others, and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFurther, the U.S. federal government has called for, or enacted, substantial changes to healthcare, trade, fiscal, and tax policies, which may include changes to existing trade agreements and may have a significant impact on our operations. For example, the current administration has initiated the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign products, including from China, that have resulted in and may result in future retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and products. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes could have on our business. If economic conditions worsen or new legislation is passed related to the healthcare system, trade, fiscal or tax policies, customer demand may not materialize to levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertain credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. If the current situation continues to deteriorate or does not improve, our business could be negatively affected by factors such as reduced demand for our products resulting from a slow-down or volatility in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers.\nThe United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business and operations.\nIn 2016 voters in the United Kingdom approved the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The U.K. exited from the European Union on January 31, 2020. Under the current withdrawal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom will be subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, during which European Union rules will continue to apply. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after the transition period has not been determined yet. As a result, the impact of Brexit is not yet known and depends on any\nagreements the United Kingdom may make to retain access to European Union or other markets after the transition period. The withdrawal could potentially disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the European Union or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Any of these events, along with any political, economic and regulatory changes that may occur, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe and internationally and harm our business and financial results. Natus has not identified any trends or potential changes to critical accounting estimates as a result of Brexit at this time, however, we will continue to assess the potential impact of Brexit on our business and operations, and on accounting and reporting considerations. The effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nOur operating results may suffer because of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nSubstantially all of our sales contracts with our U.S. based customers provide for payment in U.S. dollars. With the exception of our Canadian operations, substantially all of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the applicable foreign currency. To date we have executed only limited foreign currency contracts to hedge these currency risks. Our future revenue and expenses may be subject to volatility due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nSubstantially all our sales from our U.S. operations to our international distributors provide for payment in U.S. dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies could increase the effective cost of our products to our international distributors as their functional currency is typically not the U.S. dollar. This could have a potential adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain average selling prices of our products to our foreign-based customers.\nThe interest rates on our revolving credit facility are priced using a spread over LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate in our term loans such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR.\nOur credit facility permits interest on the outstanding principal balance to be calculated based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\") announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, and the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate and a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average, respectively, which are currently intended to serve as alternative reference rates to LIBOR. Considerable uncertainty exists around what will replace LIBOR and how it will be implemented. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be implemented in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Actions in the meantime, by the FCA, other regulators, or law enforcement agencies are expected to influence the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the U.K. or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect our indebtedness that bear interest at a floating rate determined by reference to LIBOR.\nIf we fail in our efforts to educate clinicians, government agency personnel, and third-party payors about the effectiveness of our products, we may not achieve future sales growth.\nIt is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians, hospital administrators, and government agencies about our products and the costs and benefits of their use. The commercial success of our products depends upon clinician, government agency, and other third-party payor confidence in the economic and clinical benefits of our products as well as their comfort with the efficacy, reliability, sensitivity and specificity of our products. We believe that clinicians will not use our products unless they determine, based on published peer-reviewed journal articles and experience, that our products provide an accurate and cost-effective alternative to other means of testing or treatment. Our customers may choose to use competitive products, which may be less expensive or may provide faster results than our devices. Clinicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products, testing practices and clinical treatments, partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third-party reimbursement. If clinicians, government agencies and hospital administrators do not adopt our products, we may not maintain profitability. Factors that may adversely affect the medical community\u2019s acceptance of our products include:\n\u2022\nPublication of clinical study results that demonstrate a lack of efficacy or cost-effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\nChanging governmental and physician group guidelines;\n\u2022\nActual or perceived performance, quality, price, and total cost of ownership deficiencies of our products relative to other competitive products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain and enhance our existing relationships and to form new relationships with leading physicians, physician organizations, hospitals, state laboratory personnel, and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nChanges in federal, state and third-party payor reimbursement policies for our products; and\n\u2022\nRepeal of laws requiring universal newborn hearing screening and metabolic screening.\nSales to members under group purchasing agreements and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices, which could reduce our operating margins.\nWe have entered and expect in the future to enter into agreements with customers who purchase a high volume of our products. Our agreements with these customers may contain discounts from our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations, which could cause our operating margins to decline. In addition, we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of GPOs, which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals, group practices and other clinics. While we make sales directly to GPO members, the GPO members receive volume discounts from our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us. Sales to members of all GPOs accounted for approximately 18.7%, 13.3% and 14.5% of our total revenue during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Certain other existing customers may be members of GPOs with which we do not have agreements. If we enter into agreements with new GPOs and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those GPOs, our operating margins could decline.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry companies, including our customers and competitors, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to our customers could become more intense. Our customers may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions and our competitors may utilize their size and broad product lines to offer cheaper alternatives to our products. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, or cash flow would suffer.\nDemand for some of our products depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, and changes in these policies could harm our business.\nA majority of customers for our products are hospitals, physician offices, and clinics. Many factors, including public policy spending provisions, available resources, and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities and the amount that they can spend on our equipment products. If budget resources limit the capital spending of our customers, they will be unlikely to either purchase any new equipment from us or upgrade to any of our newer equipment products. Lack of liquidity in credit markets and uncertainty about future economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the spending patterns of our customers. These factors can have a significant adverse effect on the demand for our products.\nOur markets are very competitive and in the United States we sell certain of our products in a mature market.\nWe face competition from other companies in all of our product lines. Our competitors range from small privately held companies to multinational corporations and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth. We do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines.\nThe markets for certain of our products in the United States, including the newborn hearing screening and EEG monitoring markets, are mature and we are unlikely to see significant growth for such products in the United States. The market for newborn care products is affected by birthrates, and a declining U.S. birthrate has adversely affected our operating results in recent periods. In the United States we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies. Our disposable supply products could face increasing competition, including competitors offering lower prices, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margins.\nOur competitors may have certain competitive advantages, which include the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products. Consequently, we may need to increase our efforts, and related expenses for research and development, marketing, and selling to maintain or improve our position.\nWe expect recurring sales to our existing customers to generate a majority of our revenue in the future, and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase products from us, our revenue may decline.\nFuture changes in technology or market conditions could result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets, including goodwill, resulting in additional charges that could significantly impact our operating results.\nOur balance sheet includes significant intangible assets, including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgment. Our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets might be hindered by events over which we have no control. Due to the highly competitive nature of the medical device industry, new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions that adversely affect the competitiveness of our products. Further, declines in our market capitalization may be an indicator that our intangible assets or goodwill carrying values exceed their fair values which could lead\nto potential impairment charges that could impact our operating results. In the past we have recorded charges for goodwill impairment and impairments of our trade names.\nIf healthcare providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our devices or supplies, or if reimbursement policies change adversely, we may not be successful marketing and selling our products or technologies.\nClinicians, hospitals, and government agencies are unlikely to purchase our products if they are not adequately reimbursed for the procedures conducted with our devices or supplies. Unless a sufficient amount of conclusive, peer-reviewed clinical data about our products has been published, third-party payors, including insurance companies and government agencies, may refuse to provide reimbursement. Furthermore, even if reimbursement is provided, it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals. Some third-party payors may impose restrictions on the procedures for which they will provide reimbursement. If healthcare providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for our products or the screenings conducted with our products, we may not achieve significant market acceptance of our products. Acceptance of our products in international markets will depend upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement, funding, and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country. We may not obtain approvals for reimbursement in a timely manner or at all.\nAdverse changes in reimbursement policies in general could harm our business. We are unable to predict changes in the reimbursement methods used by third-party healthcare payors, particularly those in countries and regions outside the United States. For example, some payors are moving toward a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. In a managed care system, the cost of our products may not be incorporated into the overall payment for patient care or there may not be adequate reimbursement for our products separate from reimbursement for other procedures.\nBecause we rely on distributors or sub-distributors to sell our products in most of our markets outside of the United States, our revenue could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us, or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated.\nWe currently rely on our distributors or sub-distributors for a majority of our sales outside the United States. Some distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and education of clinicians and government agencies. Our contracts with our distributors or sub-distributors do not assure us significant minimum purchase volume. If a contract with a distributor or sub-distributor is terminated for cause or by us for convenience, the distributor or sub-distributor will have no obligation to purchase products from us. We intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in Europe, Japan, and other developed markets. If we fail to sell our products through our international distributors, we would experience a decline in revenue unless we begin to sell our products directly in those markets. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. Even if we are successful in selling our products through new distributors, the rate of growth of our revenue could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell a large dollar volume of our products. None of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products.\nWe may be subject to foreign laws governing our relationships with our international distributors. These laws may require us to make payments to our distributors if we terminate our relationship for any reason, including for cause. Some countries require termination payments under local law or legislation that may supersede our contractual relationship with the distributor. Any required payments would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks inherent in our business which may disrupt our business and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including business continuity, direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal and external processes, systems or human error, the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events (such as natural disasters, pandemics, cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, civil unrest and other catastrophes) or from other external events. For example, we conduct a significant portion of our activities, including administration and data processing, at facilities located in California which has experienced major earthquakes in the past, as well as other natural disasters. In addition, the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 since December 2019 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region, as well as reports of dramatically reduced economic activity in the region, which may negatively affect our operation particularly in Asia. Exposure to such events could disrupt our systems and operations significantly, which may result in financial loss and reputational damage.\nIf we lose our relationship with any supplier of key product components or our relationship with a supplier deteriorates or key components are not available in sufficient quantities, our manufacturing could be delayed and our business could suffer.\nWe contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and the production of our disposable products. Some of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us. We have relatively few sources of supply for some of the components used in our products and in some cases we rely entirely on sole-source suppliers. In addition, the lead-time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable. If our suppliers become\nunwilling or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements, it might be difficult to establish additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner, or at all. This would cause our product sales to be disrupted and our revenue and operating results to suffer.\nReplacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations. Incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales. This process may take a substantial period of time, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval. This could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results.\nWe have substantial international operations which are subject to numerous risks; if our international operations are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\nIn 2019, approximately 41.0% of our sales were made outside the United States. We plan to expand our international sales and marketing efforts to increase sales of our products in foreign countries. We may not realize corresponding growth in revenue from growth in international unit sales, due to the lower average selling prices we receive on sales outside of the United States. Even if we are able to successfully expand our international selling efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to create or increase demand for our products outside of the United States. Our international operations are subject to other risks, which include:\n\u2022\nImpact of possible recessions in economies outside the United States;\n\u2022\nPolitical and economic instability, including instability related to war and terrorist attacks and to political and diplomatic matters such as Brexit;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in tariffs and trade protection measures;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approval and complying with foreign regulations, including the EU Medical Device Regulation;\n\u2022\nAn outbreak of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, which may cause us or our distributors, vendors and/or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country;\n\u2022\nContractual provisions governed by foreign law, such as local law rights to sales commissions by terminated distributors;\n\u2022\nDecreased healthcare spending by foreign governments that would reduce international demand for our products;\n\u2022\nStrengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that could make our products less competitive because approximately half of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars;\n\u2022\nChanges in capital and exchange controls affecting international trade;\n\u2022\nGreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nDifficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nReduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nAttitudes by clinicians, and cost reimbursement policies, towards use of disposable supplies that are potentially unfavorable to our business;\n\u2022\nComplying with U.S. regulations that apply to international operations, including trade laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and anti-boycott laws, as well as international laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nLoss of business through government tenders that are held annually in many cases; and\n\u2022\nPotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws, including legislative changes concerning taxation of income earned outside of the United States.\nIn particular, our international sales could be adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies, which makes our products more costly to international customers for sales denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWe depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel, and, without additional employees, we cannot grow or maintain profitability.\nOur products and technologies are complex, and we depend substantially on the continued service of our senior management team. The loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development process. Our future success will depend, in part, on the continued service of our key management personnel, software engineers, and other research and development employees, and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel, including customer service, marketing, and sales staff. Demand for these skilled employees in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our product technologies. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nWe have experienced seasonality in the sale of our products.\nWe experience seasonality in our revenue. For example, our sales typically decline from the second half of our fiscal year to the first half of the fiscal year, due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers, many of which\nare government agencies, and the compensation arrangements of our direct sales employees, as those arrangements are tied to calendar-year sales plans. We anticipate that we will continue to experience seasonal fluctuations, which may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. We believe that you should not rely on our results of operations for interim periods as an indication of our expected results in any future period.\nWe have initiated changes to our information systems that could disrupt our business and our financial results.\nWe plan to continuously improve our information systems to support the form, functionality, and scale of our business. These types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate. Failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the ongoing operations and support of the new systems could materially harm our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Compliance and Regulatory Environment\nOur ability to market and sell products depends upon receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approval of our products and manufacturing operations. Our failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and compliance could negatively affect our business.\nOur products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and by similar regulatory agencies in other countries. Our products are classified as medical devices. Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to regulations that are wide ranging and govern, among other things: design and development; manufacturing and testing; labeling; storage and record keeping; advertising, promotion, marketing, sales distribution and export; and surveillance and reporting of deaths or serious injuries.\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device that we propose to market in the United States must first receive one of the following types of FDA premarket review authorizations:\n\u2022\nClearance via Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938, as amended; or\n\u2022\nPremarket approval via Section 515 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act if the FDA has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury.\nThe FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. The premarket approval application process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process, and must be supported by extensive data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA may not grant either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market. Further, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a premarket approval application. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Further, our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective.\nDelays in receipt of, or failure to receive, clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could adversely impact our operating results. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply with these requirements, the FDA can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as:\n\u2022\nFines, injunctions and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nRecall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\nIssuance of public notices or warnings;\n\u2022\nImposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nRefusal of our requests for Section 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products;\n\u2022\nWithdrawal of Section 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals already granted;\n\u2022\nCriminal prosecution;\n\u2022\nDomestic regulation of our products and manufacturing operations, other than that which is administered by the FDA, includes the Environmental Protection Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state and local counterparts to these Acts; or\nForeign governments and regulatory authorities have, and may continue to, propose and implement regulations that apply to our products and operations. For example, in 2017 the European Union adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements once it is fully implemented in 2020. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including\nfines and revocation or suspension of a company's business license, mandatory price reductions, and criminal sanctions. Future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business would be harmed if the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations governing the manufacture of our products and/or we do not pass an inspection.\nWe and our suppliers are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation. The Quality System Regulation sets forth the FDA\u2019s requirements for good manufacturing practices of medical devices and includes requirements for, among other things, the design, testing, production processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of such products. In addition, we and our suppliers must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facility and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by federal, state and foreign agencies, including the FDA. We cannot assure you that we and our suppliers are or will continue to be in full compliance with the Quality System Regulation, nor that we will not encounter any manufacturing difficulties.\nIn 2014 and 2016 we received formal communications from the FDA regarding deficiencies in our manufacturing processes in our Seattle facility. As a result, we imposed ship-holds on certain of our products produced there and have discontinued certain other products produced in that facility. We are dedicating substantial resources to the resolution of the conditions identified by the FDA. These actions had an adverse effect on our results of operations in 2016 and 2017.\nOur inability to address issues that have been raised by the FDA, or failure of us or our third party suppliers and manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products and manufacturing restrictions, any of which could harm our business.\nOur business may suffer if we are required to revise our labeling or promotional materials, or if the FDA takes an enforcement action against us for off-label uses.\nWe are prohibited by the FDA from promoting or advertising our medical device products for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals, or from making unsupported promotional claims about the benefits of our products. If the FDA determines that our claims are outside the scope of our clearances, or are unsupported, it could require us to revise our promotional claims or take enforcement action against us. If we were subject to such an action by the FDA, our sales could be delayed, our revenue could decline, and our reputation among clinicians could be harmed. Likewise, if we acquire new products, either through the purchase of products, technology assets, or businesses, that are subsequently deemed to have inadequate supporting data, we may be required to (i) obtain adequate data, which could be costly and impede our ability to market these products, or (ii) modify the labeling on these products, which could impair their marketability, as described above.\nWe are subject to data privacy laws and our failure to comply with them may require us to make significant changes to our products or incur penalties or other liabilities.\nOur business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), personal health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, international and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information. We sign business associate agreements with certain customers for which we perform services as business associates under HIPAA, and therefore we are directly subject to certain provisions of HIPAA that are applicable to business associates. Noncompliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of personal information, including HIPAA, or with contractual obligations under any business associate agreement may lead to significant fines, civil and criminal penalties, or liabilities. We also may be required to report breaches of protected health information that we experience. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), audits the compliance of business associates and enforces HIPAA privacy and security standards. HHS enforcement activity has become more significant over the last few years and HHS has signaled its intent to continue this trend.\nIn addition to the regulation of personal health information, a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of PII, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State consumer protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020, may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of PII, including information related to customers, suppliers and care providers. The CCPA provides individuals certain rights regarding the collection or processing of personal data related to California residents, which may restrict our ability to use personal data, of California residents. Failure to comply with the CCPA could result in penalties of up to $7,500 per violation.\nOutside the United States, we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. We serve customers across the globe. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are be enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the European Union, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that will have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) applies uniformly across the European Union and to businesses in other countries that target European Union residents and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals, including employees, residing in the European Union to comply with European Union privacy and data protection rules. Other international jurisdictions, have issued privacy laws that mirror many of the requirements of GDPR. As we expand our international operations, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with multiple data privacy laws. Failure to comply with these laws may result in significant fines and other administrative penalties and harm our business.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional costs or changes in our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or could result in significant civil and other liabilities. Additionally, the restrictions imposed by these laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products, reduce overall demand for our products, require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional costs and burdens.\nAn interruption in or breach of security of our information or manufacturing systems, including the occurrence of a cyber-incident or a vulnerability in our cybersecurity, or disclosure of private patient health information, may result in a loss of business or damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on communications, information and manufacturing systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or cyber incident affecting these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management or product manufacturing. Similarly, there can be no assurance that our third-party collaborators, distributors and other contractors and consultants will be successful in protecting our data that is stored on their systems. A cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include an unauthorized actor gaining access to our systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or cyber incidents could result in a loss of customer business or reputation and have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our products are used in customer networks transmitting a range of sensitive information and any actual or perceived exposure of our products used in customer networks to malicious software or cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn the course of performing our business we obtain, from time to time, confidential patient health information. For example, we may learn patient names and be exposed to confidential patient health information when we provide training on our products to our customers\u2019 staff. Complying with federal and state privacy and security requirements imposes compliance related costs, subjects us to potential regulatory audits, and may restrict our business operations. These various laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies creating potentially complex compliance issues for our business. If we were to violate any of our legal obligations to safeguard any confidential patient health information or protected health information against improper use and disclosure, we could lose customers and be exposed to liability, and our reputation and business could be harmed. Concerns or allegations about our practices with regard to the privacy or security of personal health information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nWe are also subject to new U.S. laws as well as laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information that may be more onerous than previous corresponding U.S. laws. These laws and regulations impose technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data and may require that we notify regulatory agencies, individuals or the public about any data security breaches. In particular, in the United States, the newly passed CCPA imposes a private right of action with damages of up to $750 per person in the event of certain data breaches. Other states are considering similar laws. As these laws and regulations develop in the United States and we expand our international operations, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with multiple cybersecurity laws. Failure to comply with these laws may result in significant fines and other administrative penalties and harm our business, and could expose us to significant civil damages.\nThe FDA has issued guidance advising manufacturers to take cybersecurity risks into account in product design for connected medical devices and systems, to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical devices that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threats into hospital systems that are connected to such devices. The FDA also issued guidance on post market management of cyber security in medical devices. Compliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and add complexity and additional management and oversight needs. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product\nofferings that involve transmission or use of clinical data. Failure to comply with these laws could result in vulnerabilities that would make us susceptible to hackers and other cyber attacks, as well as fines or administrative penalties that, if imposed, would harm our business.\nHealthcare reforms, changes in healthcare policies, and changes to third-party reimbursements for our products may affect demand for our products.\nUncertainty in the U.S. healthcare system may influence the way our customers spend on medical devices, supplies, and services in the future. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (\u201cACA\u201d) may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemakings could affect rebates, prices, or the rate of price increase for healthcare products and services. Cost-containing measures implemented by healthcare providers worldwide could harm our profitability. If we fail to effectively react to healthcare reforms, our business may be adversely affected.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder require companies, including Natus, to disclose the existence in their products of certain metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are metals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These rules requires investigative efforts, which has and will continue to cause us to incur associated costs, could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in our products and may cause reputational harm if we determine that certain of our components contain such conflict minerals or if we are unable to alter our processes or sources of supply to avoid using such materials, all of which could adversely impact sales of our products and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation\nWe may not be able to preserve the value of our intellectual property because we may not be able to protect access to it or we may lose our intellectual property rights due to expiration of our licenses or patents.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights do not adequately cover the technology we employ, other medical device companies could sell products with features similar to ours, and this could reduce demand for our products. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, others may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate. Enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and may divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. Failing to enforce our intellectual property rights could also result in the loss of those rights.\nU.S. tax reform legislation could materially affect our business and financial condition.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law in December 2017. The new law made numerous changes to federal corporate tax law that we expect will impact our effective tax rate in future periods. The changes included in the Tax Act were broad and complex and included, among others, reducing the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limiting the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings, eliminating net operating loss carrybacks, imposing a one-time tax on offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, allowing immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. The final impacts of the Tax Act may differ from our current estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts.\nIf guidelines mandating universal newborn hearing screening do not continue to develop in foreign countries and governments do not mandate testing of all newborns as we anticipate, or if those guidelines have a long phase-in period, our sales of newborn hearing screening products may not achieve the revenue growth we have achieved in the past.\nWe estimate that approximately 95% of the children born in the United States are currently being tested for hearing impairment prior to discharge from the hospital. To date, there has been only limited adoption of newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge by foreign governments, and when newborn hearing screening programs are enacted by foreign governments there can be a phase-in period spanning several years. The widespread adoption of guidelines depends, in part, on our ability to educate foreign government agencies, neonatologists, pediatricians, third-party payors, and hospital administrators about the benefits of universal newborn hearing screening as well as the use of our products to perform the screening and monitoring. Our revenue from our newborn hearing screening product lines may not grow if foreign governments do not require universal newborn\nhearing screening prior to hospital discharge, if physicians or hospitals are slow to comply with those guidelines, or if governments provide for a lengthy phase-in period for compliance.\nIf we deliver products with defects, we may incur costs to repair and, possibly, recall that product and market acceptance of our products may decrease.\nThe manufacturing and marketing of our products involve an inherent risk of our delivering a defective product or products that do not otherwise perform as we expect. We may incur substantial expense to repair any such products and may determine to recall such a product, even if not required to do so under applicable regulations. Any such recall would be time consuming and expensive. Product defects or recalls may adversely affect our customers\u2019 acceptance of the recalled and other of our products.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe could be subject to healthcare fraud regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: (i) the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing advice to customers, and/or (iii) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nOur operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim.\nThe medical technology industry is characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights. We expect that medical screening and diagnostic products may become increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products overlap. Third parties such as individuals, educational institutions, or other medical device companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could have any of the following negative consequences:\n\u2022\nResult in costly litigation and damage awards;\n\u2022\nDivert our management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nCause product shipment delays or suspensions; or\n\u2022\nRequire us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nWe are currently subject to cases based on third-party patent infringement claims. A successful claim of infringement against us from any current or future claim could result in a substantial damage award and materially harm our financial condition. Our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology, or design and build non-infringing products, could prevent us from selling our products and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may also find it necessary to bring infringement actions against third parties to seek to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation of this nature, even if successful, is often expensive and disruptive of our management\u2019s attention, and in any event may not lead to a successful result relative to the resources dedicated to any such litigation.\nWe license intellectual property rights from third parties and would be adversely affected if our licensors do not appropriately defend their proprietary rights or if we breach any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others.\nWe license rights from third parties for products and technology that are important to our business. If our licensors are unsuccessful in asserting and defending their proprietary rights, including patent rights and trade secrets, we may lose the competitive advantages we have through selling products that we license from third parties. Additionally, if it is found that our licensors infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we may be prohibited from marketing our existing products that incorporate\nthose proprietary rights. Under our licenses, we are subject to commercialization and development, sublicensing, royalty, insurance and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, or otherwise breach a license agreement, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license.\nProduct liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages, and an increase in our insurance rates.\nThe sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of a product liability claim by someone claiming to have been injured using one of our products or claiming that one of our products failed to perform properly. A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend, either of which could materially harm our business reputation or financial condition. Our product liability insurance may not protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which may cause the value of our stock to decline or subject us to a securities class action litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock price may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional or other large stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nvolume and timing of orders for our products;\n\u2022\ndevelopments generally affecting medical device companies;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of us and our business, including changes in market valuations of medical device companies; and\n\u2022\nour results of operations and financial performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Stock Market and the market for medical devices in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business.", "PERMNO": 89036, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "NTUS"}
