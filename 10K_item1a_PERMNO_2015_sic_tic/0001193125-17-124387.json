Risk Factors\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or our industry or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historic or expected results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nEconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our merchandise, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. Some of the factors impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, wages and employment, consumer debt, the availability of customer credit, inflation and deflation, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. Downturns in the economy typically affect consumer purchases of merchandise and could adversely impact our results of operations and continued growth.\nFluctuations in consumer preferences may adversely affect the demand for our products and result in a decline in our sales.\nOur retail fashion jewelry and accessories business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, which are dictated in part by fashion trends, perceived value and seasonality. If we are unable to anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends, our sales may decline, and we may be faced with excess inventories. If this occurs, we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and adversely affect our margins. In addition, if we miscalculate customer tastes and our customers come to believe that we are no longer able to offer merchandise that appeals to them, our brand image may suffer.\nAdvance purchases of our merchandise make us vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and pricing shifts and may negatively affect our results of operations.\nFluctuations in the demand for retail jewelry and accessories especially affect the inventory we sell because we make decisions for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise with our suppliers in advance of the applicable season and sometimes before trends are identified or evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak selling seasons when we and other retailers generally build up inventory levels. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and it is more difficult for us to respond to new or changing customer needs. Our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins. If we underestimate demand for our merchandise, on the other hand, we may experience inventory shortages resulting in missed sales and lost revenues. Either of these events could negatively affect our operating results and brand image.\nOur business depends on the willingness of vendors and service providers to supply us with goods and services pursuant to customary credit arrangements which may not be available to us in the future.\nLike most companies in the retail sector, we purchase goods and services from trade creditors pursuant to customary credit arrangements. Our inability to maintain or obtain trade credit from vendors and service providers on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a significant adverse impact on our inventory levels and operating cash flows and negatively impact our liquidity. Also, the loss of or reduction in trade credit could adversely impact our ability to execute our business plans, develop or enhance our products or services, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. The tightening of trade credit could also result in our vendors and service providers demanding accelerated payment of amounts due to them or require advance payments or letters of credit before merchandise is shipped to us. Any adverse changes in our trade credit for these or other reasons could increase our costs of financing our inventory or negatively impact our ability to deliver merchandise to our customers, which in turn would negatively impact our financial performance.\nA disruption of imports from our foreign suppliers may increase our costs and reduce our supply of merchandise.\nOur performance depends, in part, on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new merchandise, and any vendor could change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us at any time. As a result, we may not be able to purchase desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future.\nWe purchased merchandise from approximately 471 suppliers in Fiscal 2016. Approximately 84% of our Fiscal 2016 merchandise was purchased from suppliers outside the United States, including 71% of those purchases facilitated by our Hong Kong buying office for purchases from China. Any event causing a sudden disruption of imports from China or other foreign countries, including political and financial instability, labor strikes, work stoppages, boycotts, weather, merchandise receipt delays, or safety issues involving merchandise, would likely have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nRecent political discourse in the United States has increasingly focused on ways to discourage U.S. businesses from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions. Many prominent government officials have publicly communicated their desire to discourage these practices, including through the possibility of imposing tariffs, border adjustments or other penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States. It has also been suggested that the United States may materially modify or withdraw from some of its existing trade agreements. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our products currently are manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign\ngovernments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes and customs restrictions on merchandise that we purchase, \u201canti-dumping\u201d duties, and port security or other events that could slow port activities, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and our revenue growth.\nIn countries outside of the United States where we operate stores, we generate revenues and incur expenses denominated in local currencies. In Fiscal 2016, approximately 41% of our net sales were earned in currencies other than the United States dollar, the majority of which were denominated in euros, British pounds and Canadian dollars. As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the amount of United States dollars into which our foreign earnings are converted is affected, which impacts our cash flows. In Fiscal 2016, the most material adverse impact of these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our cash flows was from the weakening of the euro against the United States dollar. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also impact our results of operations because the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries, when translated into United States dollars, reflect the average foreign currency exchange rates for the months that comprise the periods presented. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of this impact.\nSubstantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in United States dollars. As a result, significant fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar against foreign currencies may adversely affect our sourcing operations. Further, a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the United States dollar could adversely impact our net sales and profit margins unless we were to raise retail prices in the affected locations. Consumers in those locations may not accept significant price increases for our merchandise.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and revenue growth.\nA continued decline in the number of people who go to shopping malls could reduce the number of our customers, reduce our net sales and leave us with unsold inventory.\nSubstantially all of our North America stores are located in shopping malls. Our North America sales are derived, in part, from traffic in those shopping malls. We depend on the ability of the shopping mall\u2019s \u201canchor\u201d tenants, generally large department stores and other area attractions, to generate consumer traffic around our stores. We also depend on the continuing popularity of shopping malls as shopping destinations for girls and young women. Sales volume and shopping mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from online retailers, competition from non-shopping mall retailers and other shopping malls where we do not have stores, and the closing of anchor tenants in a particular shopping mall. In addition, declines in customer traffic at shopping malls have adversely affected our results of operations. A continuing decline in the popularity of shopping malls among our target customers that may curtail customer visits to shopping malls could result in decreased sales and leave us with unsold inventory, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to grow our store base outside of North America or expand our international franchising businesses may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur growth plans include expanding our store base outside of North America and continuing our expansion in Europe. We have limited experience in operating stores outside of North America and Europe. Our ability to grow successfully outside of North America depends in part on determining a sustainable formula to build customer loyalty and gain market share in certain especially challenging international retail environments. Customers in our new markets may not be as familiar with our brands, and we may need to build brand awareness in these markets through greater investments in promotional activities. As a result, our sales may not be at volumes we plan or not result in the margins we anticipate. In addition, in many of these markets, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics,\nregulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have experience. Also, the integration of our operations in foreign countries presents certain challenges not necessarily presented in the integration of our North America and Europe operations. As a result of several of these factors, we closed all of our 17 company-operated China stores in May 2014. If our expansion plans outside of North America and Europe are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our consolidated operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also plan to expand into new countries by entering into franchising and licensing agreements with unaffiliated third parties who are familiar with the local retail environment and have sufficient retail experience to operate stores in accordance with our business model, which requires strict adherence to the guidelines established by us in our franchising agreements. Failure to identify appropriate and creditworthy franchisees or concession stores partners, or negotiate acceptable terms in our agreements that meet our financial targets would adversely affect our international expansion goals, and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and impede our strategy of increasing our net sales through expansion.\nThe failure to expand our distribution channels through our store concession model and other strategic initiatives and to minimize expenses through our cost savings initiatives.\nWe have sought to expand our distribution channels through several initiatives with strategic partners, including selling our merchandise through concession stores. Although the concession store model is intended to improve our profitability as a result of the reduced overhead, we are subject to risks related to the merchandise offered for sale and the creditworthiness of our counterparties. Under our store concession model, we own merchandise until sold to the customer, so we bear the financial risk until the point of sale. In addition, failure to identify appropriate and creditworthy concession store partners or negotiate acceptable agreements therewith could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and impede our ability to increase our net sales through concession sales.\nWe also continually endeavor to minimize our operating expenses without adversely affecting the profitability of our business. We recently implemented changes to our buying and merchandising structure and streamlined our global reporting structure as part of these cost saving initiatives. The success of these and other initiatives will depend on various factors, including the execution of our strategy, and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences. The failure to successfully execute these strategies could result in lower cost savings than anticipated, lower sales and a failure to realize the benefits of the expenditures incurred for these initiatives.\nThe failure to successfully expand our e-commerce business could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur e-commerce business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of our Internet service providers to perform their services properly and in a timely and efficient manner;\n\u2022\nincreases in software filters that may inhibit our ability to market our merchandise through e-mail messages to our customers and increases in consumer privacy concerns relating to the Internet;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable federal and state regulation, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act;\n\u2022\nbreaches of Internet security;\n\u2022\nfailures in our Internet infrastructure or the failure of systems or third parties, resulting in website downtime or other problems;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our service providers to process online customer orders properly and on time;\n\u2022\nfailure by our service provider to provide warehousing and fulfillment services; and\n\u2022\nfailure to keep up with changes in technology.\nFailure to grow our current e-commerce business, or successfully launch and grow our e-commerce business in new markets, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and impede our growth strategy.\nWe experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins, which could impact our credit ratings and reduce the trading price of our outstanding notes.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to improve sales. Our net sales for Fiscal 2016 declined 6.5% to $1,311.3 million from $1,402.9 million for Fiscal 2015, and our same stores sales decreased 3.3% in Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015. A variety of factors affect comparable sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases, changes in our merchandise mix, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis.\nOur ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and fashion trends, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, selecting effective marketing techniques, and optimizing store performance. Our comparable sales results and margins may not meet the expectations of our investors or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods and could cause our credit ratings to decline and reduce the trading price of our outstanding notes.\nOur operations in international markets may be adversely affected by regulatory, legal, political and economic risks.\nA significant amount of our stores are located outside of the United States. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with international operations. These risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, changes in tariffs, taxes, exchange rates or regulatory requirements, and political unrest. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and revenue growth. In addition, in June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, commonly known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the European Union, where a significant number of our stores are located. Risks associated with Brexit include significant disruptions in the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, increased legal and regulatory complexities, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as higher potential costs of conducting business in Europe. The United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit the European Union could also result in similar votes or referendums in other European countries in which we do business. These changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur cost of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state, local and international regulations regarding the content of our merchandise.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (\u201cCPSIA\u201d), in general, bans the sale of children\u2019s products containing lead in excess of certain maximum standards, and imposes other restrictions and requirements on the sale of children\u2019s products, including importing, testing and labeling requirements. In addition, various states, from time to time, propose or enact legislation regarding heavy metals or chemicals in products that differ from federal laws. We are also subject to various other health and safety rules and regulations, such as the U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Hazardous Substance Act and the Canadian Food and Drugs Act. Our inability to comply with these regulatory requirements, including the new initiatives labeled as \u201cgreen chemistry,\u201d or other existing or newly adopted regulatory requirements, could increase our cost of doing business, result in lower sales or result in significant fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition to regulations governing the sale of our merchandise in the United States and Canada, we are also subject to regulations governing the sale of our merchandise in our Europe operations. The European Union \u201cREACH\u201d legislation requires identification and disclosure of chemicals in consumer products, including chemicals that might be in the merchandise that we sell. Over time, this regulation, among other items, may require us to substitute certain chemicals contained in our products with substances the European Union considers safer. Our failure to comply with this foreign legislation could result in significant fines or penalties and increase our cost of doing business.\nRecalls, product liability claims, and government, customer or consumer concerns about product safety could harm our reputation, increase costs or reduce sales.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state and international regulatory authorities, and our products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by these authorities. Concerns about product safety, including but not limited to concerns about the safety of products manufactured in China (where most of our products are manufactured), could lead us to recall selected products. Recalls and government, customer or consumer concerns about product safety could harm our reputation, increase costs or reduce sales, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we are unable to renew or replace our store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if any of our current leases are terminated prior to the expiration of their stated term and we cannot find suitable alternate locations, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOther than the stores that we operate through our concession stores model, all of our stores are leased. Our ability to renew any expired lease or, if such lease cannot be renewed, our ability to lease a suitable alternate location, and our ability to enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms will depend on many factors which in part are not within our control, such as availability of sufficient funds, conditions in the local real estate market, absence of occupancy delays, ability to construct, furnish and supply a store in a timely and cost effective manner, ability to hire and train new personnel, especially store managers, in a cost effective manner, competition for desirable properties, our relationships with current and prospective landlords, and negotiating acceptable lease terms that meet our financial targets. Our ability to operate stores on a profitable basis depends on various factors, including whether we can reduce the number of under-performing stores which have a higher level of fixed costs in comparison to net sales. If we are unable to renew existing leases or lease suitable alternate locations, enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or increase our same store sales, our growth and our profitability could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of retail real estate properties within the countries in which we operate. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents, renew expiring leases or enter into new leases, in each case at favorable rents. These decisions could also impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our financial targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing store portfolio and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNatural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions or potential emergence of disease or pandemic could adversely affect our net sales or supply of inventory.\nUnusually adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, the potential emergence of widespread disease or pandemic or similar disruptions, especially during peak holiday selling seasons, but also at other times, could significantly reduce our net sales. In addition, these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, earnings, and cash flow.\nInformation technology systems damage, interruptions or changes may disrupt our supply of merchandise.\nOur information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss or theft and may not be able to manage inventories or process transactions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe continually make significant technology investments to help maintain and update our existing information technology systems. Implementing significant system changes increases the risk of information technology system disruptions and potentially increases costs. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIf we experience a data security breach and confidential customer information is disclosed, we may be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity, which could affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, and we may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these cybersecurity risks or to remediate a data security breach.\nWe are continuing to expand our digital reach through various channels, including e-commerce. As we continue to expand these channels, our risks regarding data privacy and possible cyber attacks increase. We and our customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in our systems. The collection of data and processing of transactions require us to receive and store a large amount of personally identifiable data. This type of data is subject to legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions. Data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting state and federal legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. We may become exposed to potential liabilities with respect to the data that we collect, manage and process, and may incur legal costs if our information security policies and procedures are not effective or if we are required to defend our methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to our methods of handling personal data could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments.\nWe may not have the resources or technical expertise to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our service providers, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increased costs, including costs to hire additional personnel, purchase additional protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nIn 2015, the payment card industry began shifting liability for certain debit and credit card transactions to retailers who do not accept Europay, MasterCard and Visa (\u201cEMV\u201d) chip technology transactions. Until we are able to fully implement and certify EMV chip technology in our stores, we may be liable for chargebacks related to fraudulent or counterfeit transactions generated through EMV chip-enabled cards, which could negatively impact our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in the anticipated seasonal business pattern could adversely affect our sales and profits and our quarterly results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors.\nOur business typically follows a seasonal pattern, peaking during the Christmas, Easter and back-to-school periods. Seasonal fluctuations also affect inventory levels, because we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of store openings, the amount of revenue contributed by new stores, the timing and level of markdowns, the timing of store closings, expansions and relocations, competitive factors and general economic conditions.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe specialty retail business is highly competitive and our results of operations are sensitive to, and may be materially adversely affected by, competitive pricing, promotional pressures, additional competitor store openings, growth of e-commerce competitors and other factors. We compete with international, national and local department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, e-commerce services, digital content and digital media devices, web services, direct marketing to consumers\nand catalog businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. Competition is principally based on merchandise variety, price, quality, availability, promotion, convenience of store location, and customer support and service. Although over 90% of our merchandise is proprietary, many of the merchandise categories we sell are also available from various other retailers at competitive prices. Many of our competitors are companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. Given the large number of companies in the retail industry, we cannot estimate the number of our competitors.\nSignificant shifts in customer buying patterns to purchase fashion jewelry and accessories at affordable prices through channels other than traditional shopping malls could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Although we have launched e-commerce sites in North America and Europe, our e-commerce business does not currently represent a significant portion of our business. We are vulnerable to competitive pressures from e-commerce activity in the market, both as they may impact our own e-commerce business, and as they may impact the operating results of our existing physical stores. Also, the Internet provides greater price transparency of our merchandise that is widely available to our customers.\nAdoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.\nCurrently, none of our employees in North America are represented by unions. However, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business, to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.\nHigher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect our business.\nPursuant to the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we are required to provide affordable coverage, as defined in the Act, to all employees, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria in the Act. Some of these requirements will be phased in over future periods. It is anticipated that there will be changes to the legislation, but we cannot predict what those changes will be or when they will take effect. It is difficult to determine at this time what impact health care reform legislation, or any changes to the legislation, will have on our financial results. Possible adverse effects could include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Increased health care and insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in the federal or state minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets.\nOur profitability could be adversely affected by higher petroleum prices.\nThe profitability of our business depends to a certain degree upon the price of petroleum products, both as a component of the transportation costs for delivery of inventory from our vendors to our stores and as a raw material used in the production of our merchandise. We are unable to predict what the price of crude oil and the resulting petroleum products will be in the future. We may be unable to pass along to our customers the increased costs that would result from higher petroleum prices. Therefore, any such increase could have a material adverse impact on our business and profitability.\nThe possibility of war and acts of terrorism could disrupt our information or distribution systems and increase our costs of doing business.\nA significant act of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on us by, among other things, disrupting our information or distribution systems, causing dramatic increases in fuel prices, thereby increasing the costs of doing business and affecting consumer spending, or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to us.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nThe execution of our business strategy largely depends on our ability to attract, hire and retain our senior management team, other key employees and a skilled and talented workforce, as well as implement succession planning for our senior management team. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods or that we will not experience unexpected levels of employee turnover. Failure to maintain an adequate succession plan to effectively transition current management leadership positions could adversely affect our institutional knowledge base and competitive advantage. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with appropriate skill sets, or we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of our senior management team, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of services of key members of our senior management team or of certain other key employees could also negatively affect our business.\nLitigation matters incidental to our business could be adversely determined against us.\nWe are involved from time to time in litigation incidental to our business. Management believes that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Depending on the actual outcome of pending litigation, charges would be recorded in the future that may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable; which could result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment assessments at least annually (or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred) by applying a fair-value test. Our principal intangible assets, other than goodwill, are tradenames, franchise agreements, and leases that existed at date of acquisition with terms that were favorable to market at that date. Our impairment testing for Fiscal 2016 resulted in our recognition of non-cash impairment charges of $169.3 million and $9.0 million related to goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. For these impairment analyses, we are required to estimate the fair value of the assets being evaluated. These fair value estimates require significant management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time of the analysis. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future. Additional impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThere are factors that can affect our provision for income taxes.\nWe are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions, including the United States, individual states and localities, and internationally. Our provision for income taxes in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the mix of income and losses from our foreign and domestic operations that may be taxed at different rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact earnings in future periods. As a result, throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. In addition, the estimates we make regarding domestic and foreign taxes are based on tax positions that we believe are supportable, but could potentially be subject to successful challenge by the Internal Revenue Service or other authoritative agencies. If we are required to settle matters in excess of our established accruals for uncertain tax positions, it could result in a charge to our earnings.\nWe had significant U.S. net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (collectively, the \u201cTax Attributes\u201d). As a result of excludable cancellation of debt income generated by the Exchange Offer described in Note 6 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, such Tax Attributes are eliminated as of January 29, 2017. Accordingly, this could adversely impact our ability to offset future tax liabilities and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition, net income and cash flow.\nIf we or our independent manufacturers, franchisees or licensees do not use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand name could be harmed due to negative publicity and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhile our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices, we do not control our independent manufacturers, franchisees or licensees, or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. Violation of labor or other laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and sanction laws administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) by our independent manufacturers, franchisees or licensees, or the divergence from labor practices generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could diminish the value of our brand and reduce demand for our merchandise if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. In addition, we also conduct business directly in many countries. Accordingly, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and OFAC sanction laws and the U.K. Bribery Act. Acts by our employees that violate these laws could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions and penalties. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to deliver our merchandise and if these third parties do not adequately perform this function, our business would be disrupted.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on the ability of our third party carriers to ship merchandise directly to our distribution facilities and individual stores. These carriers typically employ personnel represented by labor unions and have experienced labor difficulties in the past. Timely receipt of merchandise by our stores and our customers may also be affected by factors such as inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, system failures and acts of terrorism. Due to our reliance on these parties for our shipments, interruptions in the ability of our vendors to ship our merchandise to our distribution facilities or the ability of carriers to fulfill the distribution of merchandise to our stores could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on single North America, Europe and International distribution facilities.\nWe handle merchandise distribution for all of our North America stores from a single facility in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois. We handle merchandise distribution for all of our Europe operations from a single facility in Birmingham, United Kingdom. We handle merchandise distribution for all of our international franchise operations from a single facility in Hong Kong. Independent third party transportation companies deliver our merchandise to our stores and our customers. Any significant interruption in the operation of our distribution facilities or the domestic transportation infrastructure due to natural disasters, accidents, inclement weather, system failures, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by employees of the transportation companies, or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores, which could result in lower sales, a loss of loyalty to our brands and excess inventory and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to protect our tradenames and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our tradenames and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. There can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our tradenames and service marks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the tradenames, service marks and proprietary rights of others. Although CLSIP has acknowledged that CBI is the majority and controlling owner of the US Claire\u2019s Marks, and expressly and irrevocably waived its right to use, exploit, register, enforce or defend the US Claire\u2019s Marks, during the term of the Transferred IP Agreement, the joint ownership of the US Claire\u2019s Marks by CSLIP and CBI may complicate our efforts to protect the US Claire\u2019s Marks in the United States. Similarly, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. Also, others may assert rights in, or ownership of, our tradenames and other proprietary rights, and we may be unable to successfully resolve those types of conflicts to our satisfaction.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value of our brands.\nOur success depends on the value of our Claire\u2019s\u00ae and Icing\u00ae brands (including the Transferred IP which will continue to be utilized by us pursuant to the Transferred IP Agreement). The Claire\u2019s\u00ae and Icing\u00ae names are integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising, and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, enjoyable customer experience. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for one or both of these brands and our public image and reputation could be tarnished by negative publicity. Any of these events could negatively impact sales.\nWe may be unable to rely on liability indemnities given by foreign vendors which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe quality of our globally sourced products may vary from our expectations and sources of our supply may prove to be unreliable. In the event we seek indemnification from our suppliers for claims relating to the merchandise shipped to us, our ability to obtain indemnification may be hindered by the supplier\u2019s lack of understanding of North America, Europe and other international product liability laws. Our ability to successfully pursue indemnification claims may also be adversely affected by the financial condition of the supplier. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are controlled by affiliates of Apollo, and its interests as an equity holder may conflict with the interests of our creditors.\nWe are controlled by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC and its subsidiaries, including Apollo Management (collectively, \u201cApollo\u201d), and Apollo has the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payments of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence of debt by us, amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the entry into extraordinary transactions. The interests of Apollo may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our creditors. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our indebtedness as it matures, the interests of Apollo as an equity holder might conflict with the interests of our creditors. In addition, Apollo may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to our creditors. Furthermore, Apollo may in the future own businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us. Apollo also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Apollo continues to own a significant amount of our combined voting power, even if such amount is less than 50%, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. In addition, because our equity securities are not registered under the Exchange Act and are not listed on any United States securities exchange, we are not subject to any of the corporate governance requirements of any United States securities exchange.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nWe are significantly leveraged. As of January 28, 2017, our total debt was approximately $2.15 billion, with maturities ranging from 2017 to 2021. In March 2017, we fully discharged our remaining obligations in respect of our 10.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017, with the effect that current debt maturities range from 2019 to 2021. We cannot make assurances that we will have the financial resources required to meet such obligations, or that the conditions of the capital markets will support, any future refinancing, replacement or restructuring of those facilities or other indebtedness.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, if any, and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and U.S Credit Facility, will be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our other indebtedness, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nimposing restrictions on the operation of our business that may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, which could be exacerbated by further volatility in the credit markets; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nDespite our substantial high indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries are still able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our debt agreements each contain certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness. However, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. As of January 28, 2017, we had undrawn availability under our ABL Credit facility and U.S. Credit Facility of $64.1 million. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, our debt agreements will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain significant restrictions that limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe agreements covering our indebtedness contain various covenants and other restrictions that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. These covenants and other restrictions limit our operating and financial flexibility and include, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimitations on dividends on, and redemptions and repurchases of, equity interests and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on liens and negative pledges;\n\u2022\nlimitations on loans and investments (including joint ventures);\n\u2022\nlimitations on debt, guarantees and hedging arrangements;\n\u2022\nlimitations on mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u2022\nlimitations on transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nlimitations on changes in business conducted by our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nlimitations on equity issuances;\n\u2022\nlimitations on amendments of debt and other material agreements; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on changes in fiscal year.\nThese restrictions on operations and financing, as well as those that may be contained in future debt agreements, may limit our ability to execute preferred business strategies. Moreover, under certain circumstances, we may be unable to comply with these covenants. If that occurs, our lenders could accelerate the payment obligations with respect to the debt. If the payment obligations with respect to our other indebtedness are accelerated, we may not be able to repay all of that debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, political, business and other factors beyond our control, including foreign currency exchange exposures. In Fiscal 2016, approximately 41% of our net sales were earned in currencies other than the United States dollar, the majority of which were denominated in euros, British pounds and Canadian dollars. As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the amount of United States dollars into which our foreign earnings are converted is affected, which impacts our cash flows. In Fiscal 2016, the most material adverse impact of these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our cash flows was from the weakening of the euro against the United States dollar. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, which actions could be the product of a court led process or a bankruptcy proceeding. These alternative measures may not be successful, may be on terms that are less favorable to us and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The obligations under our indebtedness, and any liens granted, will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition.\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to repay our indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 67459, "SIC": 5600, "TIC": "CLE"}
