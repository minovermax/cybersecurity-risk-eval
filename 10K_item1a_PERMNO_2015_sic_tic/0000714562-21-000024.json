{"cik": "714562", "company": "FIRST FINANCIAL CORP /IN/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Corporation involves risk, some of which, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal, compliance, reputational, and strategic risks, could be substantial and is inherent in our business. This risk also includes the possibility that the value of the investment could decrease considerably, you could lose all or part of your investment, and dividends or other distributions concerning the investment could be reduced or eliminated. Discussed below are the most significant risks and uncertainties that management believes could adversely affect our financial results and condition, as well as the value of, and return on, an investment in the Corporation. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, or other such epidemic, pandemic, or outbreak of a highly contagious disease, occurring in the United States or in the geographies in which it conducts operations, could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business operations, asset valuations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The COVID-19 outbreak, or an outbreak of another highly contagious or infectious disease, could negatively impact the ability of our employees and customers to conduct such transactions and disrupt the business activities and operations of our customers in the geographic areas in which we operate. The spread of the COVID-19 virus had an impact on the Corporation\u2019s operations during fiscal year 2020, and we expect that the virus will continue to have an impact on business, financial condition, and results of operations and our customers during fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in the behavior of our customers, businesses, and employees, including illness, quarantines, social distancing practices, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Future effects, including additional actions taken by federal, state, and local governments to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, are unknown. Any sustained disruption to our operations is likely to negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding our contingency plans and other safeguards against pandemics or another contagious disease, the spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the availability of our personnel who are necessary to conduct our business operations, as well as potentially impact the business and operations of our third party service providers who perform critical services for us. If the response to contain COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, is unsuccessful, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business operations, asset valuations, financial condition, and results of operations. Material adverse impacts may include all or a combination of valuation impairments on our intangible assets, investments, loans, loan servicing rights, deferred tax assets, or counter-party risk derivatives. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when COVID-19 be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be reopened.\nWe are subject to increasing credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. We are exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with loans and borrowers. As the overall economic climate in the U.S., generally, and in our market areas specifically, experience material disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our borrowers may have difficulties in repaying their loans. Governmental actions providing payment relief to borrowers affected by COVID-19 could preclude our ability to initiate foreclosure proceedings in certain circumstances and, as a result, the collateral\nwe hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate and multifamily residential loans include the duration of state and local moratoriums on evictions for non-payment of rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject us to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nBank regulatory agencies and various governmental authorities are urging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. We are actively working to support our borrowers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them and on our loan portfolio, including through loan modifications that defer payments for those who experienced a hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although recent regulatory guidance provides that such loan modifications are exempt from the calculation and reporting of troubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and loan delinquencies, we cannot predict whether such loan modifications may ultimately have an adverse impact on our profitability in future periods. Our inability to successfully manage the increased credit risk caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur participation in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) exposes us to credit risk and regulatory enforcement risk, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation is a participating lender in the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, which was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this program, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation obtained approval from the SBA for 1,734 PPP loans totaling $169.8 million for both existing and new customers, with an average loan size of approximately $98 thousand. The net deferred fee related to PPP loan origination totaled $2.4 million at December 31, 2020. The Corporation may be exposed to credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which these loans were originated, funded, or serviced. If a deficiency is identified, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Corporation.\nThese PPP loans are subject to the regulatory requirements that would require forbearance of loan payments and other relief to borrowers for a specified time or that would limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If the borrower under the PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at the heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit.\nInterest rate volatility stemming from COVID-19 could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, deposits, and profitability.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. Following the COVID-19 outbreak and during 2020, market interest rates have declined significantly. The yields on 10-year and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows, and in March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) of the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to a target range of 0.00% to 0.25% citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in certain sectors. Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced it will take the following actions:\n\u2022purchase U.S. Treasury bills;\n\u2022initiate overnight repurchase agreement operations;\n\u2022reinvest principal received on the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities portfolio; and\n\u2022reduce the interest paid on excess bank reserves held by the Federal Reserve.\nA prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe Corporation may become subject to Covid-19-related litigation.\nLitigation related to the COVID-19 pandemic has been commenced against some banks. These lawsuits assert a variety of claims, including alleged mishandling of the PPP loans, violations of executive orders and regulatory guidance prohibiting or limiting debt collection, evictions and foreclosures, discriminatory program administration, workplace safety claims and claims alleging minimization in securities filings of the COVID-19 effect on operations. The Corporation is not a party to any such litigation, and we are not aware of any facts which may give rise to such litigation. While we believe our strong compliance and risk culture, proactive pandemic actions and clear communication with our customers employees and shareholders mitigate this legal risk, there can be no assurance that we will not become a party to COVID-19 related litigation.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Conditions\nEconomic conditions have affected and could adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nThe Corporation\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services that the Corporation offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Corporation operates and in the U.S. as a whole. An economic downturn or sustained, high unemployment levels, decreased investor or business confidence, trade wars and the imposition of tariffs on goods purchased or sold by our customers, the effect of a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease on our customers, stock market volatility, and other factors beyond our control may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans (thereby, increasing the risk of loan defaults and losses), the value of collateral securing those loans, demand for loans and other products and services we offer, and our deposit levels and composition. As a result, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nGeographic concentration of the Corporation\u2019s markets makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions and a downturn in local economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nUnlike larger banking organizations that are more geographically diversified, the Corporation\u2019s operations are currently concentrated in west central Indiana, east central Illinois, western Kentucky, and middle and western Tennessee, and most of our customers are located in these markets. The economic conditions in these local markets may be different from, and in some instances be worse than, the economic conditions in the U.S. as a whole. As a result of this geographic concentration, the Corporation\u2019s financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in the Corporation\u2019s markets could result in one or more of the following, which may adversely affect our business:\n\u2022an increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022an increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022an increase in our allowance for credit losses;\n\u2022a decrease in the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022a decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage;\n\u2022a decrease in net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors, which may impair their ability to honor guarantees made to us; and\n\u2022a decrease in deposits balances.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon the Corporation\u2019s net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Corporation\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, domestic and international events, changes in U.S. and other financial markets, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest that is received on loans and securities and the interest that is paid on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s financial assets and liabilities.\nFor several years prior to December 2015, the FOMC kept the target federal funds rate between 0% to 0.25% to help the overall U.S. economy. Beginning in late 2015 and continuing through 2018, the FOMC steadily increased the target federal funds rate up to between 2.25% to 2.5%. In 2019, the FOMC decreased rates on three separate occasions for a total decrease of 75 basis\npoints, resulting in a target federal funds rate between 1.5% to 1.75%. Following the COVID-19 outbreak and during 2020, market interest rates have declined significantly. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond fell below 1.00% on March 3, 2020 for the first time and the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate to a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be adversely affected. Such an interest rate environment may also result in us incurring a higher cost to retain our deposits. While the higher payment amounts we would receive on adjustable-rate or variable-rate loans in a rising interest rate environment may increase our interest income, some borrowers may be unable to afford the higher payment amounts, and this could result in a higher rate of default. Rising interest rates also may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate investment securities. Accordingly, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may adversely impact the value of, and the return on, our financial instruments that are indexed to LIBOR.\nThe Corporation and its subsidiaries have financial instruments which have a rate indexed to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. In late 2020, the LIBOR administrator published a consultation regarding its intention to delay the date on which it will cease publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023 for the most common tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, including the three-month LIBOR, but indicated no new contracts using U.S. dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 20121. Publication of a non-U.S. dollar LIBOR would continue to cease after December 31, 2021. Notwithstanding the publication of this consultation, there is no assurance of how long LIBOR of any currency or tenor will continue to be published. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease or continue to be published before or after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, as applicable, or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.\nAs a result of the 2017 announcement, regulators, industry groups, and committees have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for financial instruments indexed to LIBOR, identified and recommended alternatives to LIBOR, and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating-rate financial instruments. For example, in June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators convened by the Federal Reserve to identity alternative reference interest rates, announced a Secured Overnight Funding Rate, a broad Treasuries overnight repurchase agreement (repo) financing rate, as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. It is currently unknown whether any of these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what effect of their implementation may have on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR and the value of financial instruments indexed to LIBOR in our portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings.\nTransition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk for us. Since proposed alternative reference rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts indexed to new rates will differ from those indexed to LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design, and hedging strategies. Further, our failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could impact our reputation and may subject us to disputes or litigation with our customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, any market-wide transition away from LIBOR could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWhen we loan money, commit to loan money, or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of loss if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts.\nAs lending is one of our primary business activities, the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and probable incurred credit losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including reviews of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. There is the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to\naccurately estimate the impacts of factors that we identify. In addition, large loans, letters of credit, and contracts with individual counterparties in our portfolio magnify the credit risk that we face, as the impact of large borrowers and counterparties not repaying their loans or performing according to the terms of their contracts has a disproportionately significant impact on our credit losses and reserves.\nThe information that we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete, which may result in an increased risk of default and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, such as fraud. Moreover, such circumstances, including fraud, may become more likely to occur or be detected in periods of general economic uncertainty. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the risks of a counterparty. In addition, in cases where we have extended credit against collateral, we may find that we are under-secured, for example, as a result of sudden declines in market values that reduce the value of collateral or due to fraud with respect to such collateral. If these events or circumstances were to occur, it could result in a potential loss of revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNew accounting standard, effective January 1, 2020, significantly changes how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Corporation implemented the provision of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d ASU 2016-13 represents a comprehensive change in estimating the allowance for credit losses from the previous \u201cincurred loss\u201d model of losses inherent in the loan portfolio to a current \u201cexpected loss\u201d model, which encompasses losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio.\nThe measurement of expected credit losses under ASU 2016-13 is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model previously required under generally accepted accounting principles, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 could materially affect how we determine our allowance for credit losses and may require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, ASU 2016-13 may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe Corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Our competitors include banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies, financial technology companies, and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Corporation\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Corporation can.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022the ability to expand the Corporation's market position;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which the Corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with the Corporation's level of service; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Corporation's competitive position, which could adversely affect the Corporation's growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation has significant exposure to risks associated with commercial and commercial real estate loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 58% of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and commercial real estate loans. These loans are generally viewed as having more inherent risk of default than residential mortgage or consumer loans. The repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business. These loans are more likely to be adversely affected by weak conditions in the economy. Also, the commercial loan balance per borrower is typically larger than that of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, indicating higher potential losses on an individual loan basis. The deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans and a reduction in interest income. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models, which, if inadequate, may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nThe processes the Corporation uses to estimate its allowance for credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models the Corporation uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Corporation may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models the Corporation uses for determining its probable credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models the Corporation uses to measure the fair value of our financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of our financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Corporation could realize upon sale or settlement of our financial instruments. Any failure in the Corporation\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nThe Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiaries are community banks and their reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers, and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results, may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Key personnel that have regular direct contact with customers and clients often build strong relationships that are important to our business. In addition, we rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue producing functions, such as loan and deposit generation. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel that we depend upon for success. Frequently, we compete in the market for talent with entities that are not subject to comprehensive regulation. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate, years of\nindustry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Also, the loss of key personnel could jeopardize our relationships with customers and clients and could lead to the loss of accounts. Losses of accounts managed by key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur operational systems and networks are subject to an increasing risk of continually evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in a loss of customer business, financial liability, regulatory penalties, damage to our reputation, or the disclosure of confidential information.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. Additionally, as part of our business, we collect, process, and retain personal, proprietary, and confidential information regarding our customers. The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational or business services disruptions. Any security breach could result in the misappropriation, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive customer information, severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors and payment, clearing, and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers\u2019 transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption. In addition, a number of our third party service providers are large national entities with dominant market presence in their respective fields. Their services could prove difficult to replace in a timely manner if a failure or other service interruption were to occur. Failures of certain vendors to provide contracted services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur significant expense.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers\u2019 accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name, which could negatively affect our reputation or result in litigation and, consequently, negatively affect our results of operation.\nThe occurrence of cybersecurity incidents across a range of industries has resulted in increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny over cybersecurity and calls for additional data privacy laws and regulations. These laws and regulations could result in increased operating expenses or increase our exposure to the risk of litigation.\nThe occurrence of a cybersecurity incident involving us, third party service providers, or our customers, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Furthermore, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on external vendors, which could expose the Corporation to additional operational risks.\nThe Corporation relies on external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations of the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus, or for any other reason, could be disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business and, in turn, the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Corporation to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Corporation may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Corporation may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Corporation\u2019s system of\ninternal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we fail to keep pace, our business may suffer.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation\u2019s operations. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Further, many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect the Corporation\u2019s growth, revenue, and profit.\nA lack of liquidity could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nThe Corporation requires liquidity to meet our deposit and other obligations as they come due. The Corporation\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry or the general economy. Factors that could reduce its access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against the Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of depositors. The Corporation may not be able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary in the future, especially if a large number of depositors sought to withdraw their deposits, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, and the Corporation\u2019s methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.\nThe Corporation\u2019s internal operations are subject to risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud, and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Additionally, instruments, systems, and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational, and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, the Corporation may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.\nThe Corporation may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Corporation cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Corporation. These losses could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may foreclose on collateral property and would be subject to the increased costs associated with ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues and earnings.\nThe Corporation forecloses on collateral property from time to time to protect its interests and thereafter owns and operates foreclosed property, in which case it is exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that the Corporation, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of its control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) environmental remediation liabilities; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations, and fiscal policies; and (x)\nnatural disasters. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from the real property, and the Corporation may have to advance funds in order to protect its interests, or it may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. These expenditures and costs could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings may be adversely impacted due to environmental liabilities associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Corporation may foreclose on and take title to properties securing loans which have defaulted. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Corporation may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Corporation to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Corporation\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Corporation\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Corporation, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support the Corporation\u2019s day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of the Corporation\u2019s vendors, or other individuals or companies, may claim to hold intellectual property sold or licensed to the Corporation by its vendors. Intellectual property claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of alleged patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Corporation may have to engage in protracted litigation, which may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, and distracting to management. If the Corporation is found to infringe upon one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party. The Corporation may also consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, however, these license agreements may also significantly increase the Corporation\u2019s operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against the Corporation or settled, the Corporation could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many customers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s operations, and the Corporation may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation\u2019s business and dilute shareholder value.\nThe Corporation generally seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale, or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential new markets, hiring experienced local management, and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022the time and costs associated with identifying potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022the accuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to a target company;\n\u2022the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022closing delays and expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by shareholders of targets;\n\u2022entry into new markets where we lack experience;\n\u2022introduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n\u2022the risk of loss of key employees and customers; and\n\u2022incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Corporation\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture growth or operating results may require the Corporation to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or it may be dilutive.\nThe Corporation is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. To the extent the Corporation\u2019s future operating results erode capital or the Corporation elects to expand through loan growth or acquisition it may be required to raise capital. The Corporation\u2019s ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of its control, and on the Corporation\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, the Corporation may not be able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, it will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on its growth and business. These restrictions could negatively impact the Corporation\u2019s ability to operate or further expand its operations through acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of the Corporation\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $87.6 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in the Corporation\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates, or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of the Corporation\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Corporation were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, the Corporation would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue.\nThe Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Corporation\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on the Corporation\u2019s debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and the Morris Plan may pay to the Corporation. Also, the Corporation\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank and/or the Morris Plan are unable to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay dividends on the Corporation\u2019s common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank and/or the Morris Plan could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the regulatory framework to which we are subject may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Corporation, the Bank, and the Morris Plan operate in a highly regulated environment and we are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC and DFI, respectively. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not our shareholders. Further, as a bank holding company, we are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and the Morris Plan and to commit resources to support our subsidiary banks if needed. This regulatory framework affects our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, and growth, among other things.\nIf, as a result of an examination, a banking regulatory were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors, and, if it is concluded that these conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, regulatory structure, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nSince the 2007-2008 financial crisis, federal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and implementations of these laws and regulations, have undergone substantial review and change. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. Financial institutions generally have also been subjected to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. These changes and increased scrutiny may result in increased costs of doing business, decreased revenues and net income, may reduce our ability to effectively compete to attract and retain customers, or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. Any future changes in federal and state law and regulations, as well as the interpretations and implementations of federal and state laws and regulations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above, impact the regulatory structure under which we operate, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and modify our business strategy, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Basel III capital rules may require us to retain higher capital levels, impacting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our stock, or pay discretionary bonuses.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC adopted final rules for the Basel III capital framework which became effective on January 1, 2015. These rules substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules formerly applicable to the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries. The rules have been phased in over time beginning in 2015 and became fully phased-in in 2019. The rules provide for minimum capital ratios of (i) common equity Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio of 4.5%, (ii) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and (iii) total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. As fully phased in, the rules also require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% on top of the foregoing minimum capital ratios, resulting in an effective requirement for minimum capital ratios of (a) common equity Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio of 7%, (b) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (c) total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for these actions.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the other federal agencies,\nincluding federal banking regulators. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including any acquisitions we desire to make. We could also incur increased costs and expenses to improve our anti-money laundering procedures and systems to comply with any regulatory requirements or actions. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nFDIC insurance premiums we pay may change and be significantly higher in the future. Market developments may significantly deplete the insurance fund of the FDIC and further reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits, thereby making it requisite upon the FDIC to charge higher premiums prospectively.\nWe have risk related to legal proceedings.\nWe are involved in judicial, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising from our business activities and fiduciary responsibilities. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending or future legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Corporation\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Corporation may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nThe Corporation has historically paid a semi-annual dividend to common shareholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on the Corporation\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors.\nThe price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock and may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. The Corporation\u2019s common stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022announcements and news reports relating to the Corporation\u2019s business and trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022fluctuations in the Corporation\u2019s results of operations;\n\u2022sales or purchases of substantial amounts of the Corporation\u2019s securities in the marketplace;\n\u2022a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022actual or expected economic conditions that are perceived to affect the Corporation, such as changes in real estate values or interest rates;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Corporation and/or our competitors;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022changes in applicable government regulation; and\n\u2022the Corporation\u2019s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects.\nAs such, the market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may not accurately reflect the underlying value of the stock, and investors should consider this before relying on the market prices of the Corporation\u2019s common stock when making an investment decision.\nFuture capital needs could result in dilution of shareholder investment.\nOur board of directors may determine from time to time there is a need to or, if our or the Bank\u2019s or the Morris Plan\u2019s regulatory capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we could be forced to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of stock or other securities, including debt securities and senior or subordinated notes. We are currently authorized to issue up to 40 million shares of common stock, of which 13.6 million shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are outstanding. Subject to certain limitations, our board of directors generally has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or part of the remaining authorized but unissued shares and to establish the rights, preferences, and privileges of any class or series of preferred stock. These equity and/or debt issuances could dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to our shareholders which may adversely impact our shareholders.\nAnti-takeover laws and charter provisions may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nProvisions of state and federal law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of the Corporation. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity, or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including the Corporation\u2019s common stock. There also are Indiana statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in the Corporation being less attractive to a potential acquiror.\nAn investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock is not an insured deposit.\nThe Corporation\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Corporation\u2019s common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 77379, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "THFF"}
