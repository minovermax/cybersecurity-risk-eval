{"cik": "1321646", "company": "Kraton Performance Polymers, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nLyondellBasell Industries provides significant operating and other services under agreements that are important to our business. The failure of LyondellBasell to perform its obligations, or the termination of these agreements, could adversely affect our operations.\nWe have operating and service agreements with LyondellBasell Industries, or LyondellBasell, that are important to our business. We are a party to:\n\u2022\noperating agreements under which LyondellBasell (in Berre, France, and Wesseling, Germany) operates and maintains our European manufacturing facilities and employs and provides substantially all of the staff for those facilities; these operating agreements also provide for site services, utilities, materials and facilities, which had previously been under separate agreements; and\n\u2022\nlease agreements under which we lease our European manufacturing sites (a 96 kiloton capacity facility in Wesseling, Germany and a 85 kiloton capacity facility in Berre, France) from LyondellBasell.\nUnder the terms of the above agreements, either party is permitted to terminate the applicable agreement in a variety of situations. The operating agreement relating to the Berre facility is terminable by either party upon 18 months\u2019 written notice. As of the date of this filing, no such notice has been given by either party. Should LyondellBasell fail to provide these services or should any operating agreement be terminated, we would be forced to obtain these services from third parties or provide them ourselves. Similarly, if in connection with or independent from the termination of an operating agreement, LyondellBasell terminates a facility lease, we would be forced to relocate our manufacturing facility. The failure of LyondellBasell to perform its obligations under, or the termination of, any of these agreements could materially adversely affect our operations and, depending on market conditions at the time of any such termination, we may not be able to enter into substitute arrangements in a timely manner, if at all, and if we are able to enter into a substitute arrangement, it may not be on terms as favorable to us.\nConditions in the global economy and capital markets may adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur products are sold in markets that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as automotive, construction and consumer products. Downturns in general economic conditions can cause fluctuations in demand for our products, product prices, volumes and margins. A decline in the demand for our products or a shift to lower-margin products due to deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect sales of our products and our profitability and could also result in impairments of certain of our assets.\nOur business and operating results have been affected by fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates and other challenges currently affecting the global economy and our customers. Uncertainty regarding global economic conditions poses a continuing risk to our business, as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which may reduce demand for our products. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe failure of our raw materials suppliers to perform their obligations under long-term supply agreements, or our inability to replace or renew these agreements when they expire, could increase our cost for these materials, interrupt production or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes use three primary raw materials: butadiene, styrene and isoprene. We have entered into long-term supply agreements with Shell Chemicals, LyondellBasell and others to supply our raw material needs in the United States and Europe. As these contracts expire, we may be unable to renew these contracts or obtain new long-term supply agreements on terms favorable to us, if at all, which may significantly impact our operations.\nIn addition, most of our long-term contracts contain provisions that allow our suppliers to limit, or allocate, the amount of raw materials shipped to us below the contracted amount in certain circumstances. If we are required to obtain alternate sources for raw materials because a supplier is unwilling or unable to perform under raw material supply agreements or if a supplier terminates its agreements with us, we may not be able to obtain these raw materials from alternative suppliers in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner, and we may not be able to enter into long-term supply agreements on terms as favorable to us, if at all. A lack of availability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf the availability of isoprene is limited, we may be unable to produce some of our products in quantities or on economic terms sought by our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our sales of products requiring isoprene.\nIsoprene is not widely available, and the few isoprene producers tend to use their production for captive manufacturing purposes or to sell only limited quantities into the world chemicals market. As a result, there is limited non-captive isoprene available for purchase in the markets in which we operate.\nCurrently, we source our isoprene requirements for the United States and Europe from a portfolio of suppliers. In Japan, we obtain the majority of our isoprene requirements from our joint venture partner, and from alternative suppliers as needed. In Brazil, isoprene is primarily obtained from a local third party supplier. These suppliers may not be able to meet our isoprene requirements, and we may not be able to obtain isoprene in quantities required for our operations on terms favorable to us, or at all. A lack of availability of isoprene in the quantities we require to produce products containing isoprene could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause there is limited non-captive isoprene availability, the market for isoprene is thin and prices are particularly volatile. Prices for isoprene are impacted by the supply and prices of natural and synthetic rubber, prevailing energy prices and the existing supply and demand of isoprene in the market. In the past, tight supply in the isoprene market has been exacerbated by operational problems of some key producers and reduced availability of crude C5 inputs for the extraction units. More recently, the trend toward lighter ethylene cracker feedslates has reduced the supply of crude C5 in the United States. This decrease has been replaced by imports of crude C5 and/or isoprene. Significant increases in the cost of isoprene could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the availability of butadiene is limited, we may be unable to produce some of our products in quantities or on economic terms sought by our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our sales of products requiring butadiene.\nThe North American market is structurally short of butadiene and has relied on imports of crude C4 and/or butadiene to balance demand. With the trend toward lighter ethylene cracker feedslates in the United States, there has been a reduction in the supply of crude C4. The North American market has been supplemented by imports of crude C4 and butadiene. Historically, the European market has been better balanced and provided exports to North America. Currently, our butadiene requirements in the United States are satisfied by several suppliers, and LyondellBasell is our major butadiene supplier in Europe. In general, the quantity of butadiene available in any one region is dependent on the cracking inputs of olefins plants, ethylene demand, inter-regional demand for butadiene and demand for other oil derivatives. Suppliers may not be able to meet our butadiene requirements, and we may not be able to obtain substitute supplies of butadiene from alternative suppliers in a timely manner or on favorable terms. A lack of availability of butadiene in the quantities we require to produce products containing butadiene could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf the availability of styrene is limited, we may be unable to produce some of our products in quantities or on economic terms sought by our customers, which could have an adverse effect on facility utilization and our sales of products requiring styrene.\nWe satisfy our styrene requirements in the United States and Europe pursuant to purchase agreements with terms of one to two years, subject to renewal conditions. We have more than one supplier in each of these regions and also generally have alternatives for either modifying the contract, supply portfolio or obtaining spot supply. As contracts expire, we cannot give assurances that we will obtain new long-term supply agreements or that the terms of any such agreements will be on terms favorable to us, and consequently our future acquisition costs for styrene may therefore increase.\nIncreases in the costs of our raw materials could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if those costs cannot be passed onto our customers.\nOur results of operations are directly affected by the cost of raw materials. We use butadiene, styrene, and isoprene as our primary raw materials in manufacturing our products. On a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, these monomers together represented approximately $512.8 million, $609.5 million and $732.9 million or 51.6%, 57.2% and 61.5% of our total cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Since the cost of our three primary raw materials comprise a significant amount of our total cost of goods sold, our selling prices for our products and therefore our total revenue is impacted by movements in our raw material costs, as well as the cost of other inputs. In the past we have experienced erratic and significant changes in the costs of these monomers, the cost of which has generally correlated with changes in energy prices, supply and demand factors, and prices for natural and synthetic rubber. The pricing for butadiene has historically been particularly volatile. Political unrest in the Middle East and market dislocation resulting from U.S. sanctions relating thereto could lead to increases in the price of crude oil, and, as a result, in the price of our primary raw materials. In addition, product mix can have an impact on our overall unit selling prices, since we provide an extensive product offering and therefore experience a wide range of unit selling prices. Because of the significant portion of our cost of goods sold represented by these three monomers, our gross profit margins could be adversely affected by changes in the cost of these raw materials if we are unable to pass the increases on to our customers.\nIn response to volatile raw material price increases, we have aggressively pursued price increases for our products to offset increased costs. Although we have been successful in recovering a substantial amount of the raw material cost increases while retaining customers, there can be no assurance that we can continue to recover raw material costs or retain customers in the future. As a result of our pricing actions, customers may become more likely to consider competitors\u2019 products, some of which may be available at a lower cost. Significant loss of customers could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSignificant fluctuations in raw material costs may result in volatility in our quarterly operating results and impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe use the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory and cost of goods sold, and therefore gross profit. In periods of raw material price volatility, reported results under FIFO will differ from what the results would have been if cost of goods sold were based on estimated current replacement cost (ECRC). Specifically, in periods of declining raw material costs, reported gross profit will be lower under FIFO than under ECRC, and in periods of rising raw material costs, gross profit will be higher under FIFO than under ECRC. However, because monomer costs are difficult to predict, we cannot accurately anticipate fluctuations in monomer costs with precision, or effectively or economically hedge against the effects of any such change. If monomer costs fluctuate in a quarter, our earnings will be affected, the magnitude of which could be significant, which could cause our earnings to depart from the periodic expectations of financial analysts or investors and, therefore, the market price of our common stock may be volatile as a result.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may lose market share to other producers of styrenic block copolymers or to producers of other products that can be substituted for our products.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from both large international producers and from smaller regional competitors. Our competitors may improve their competitive position in our core markets by successfully introducing new products, improving their manufacturing processes, or expanding their capacity or manufacturing facilities. Further, some of our competitors benefit from advantageous cost positions that could make it increasingly difficult for us to compete in markets for less-differentiated applications. If we are unable to keep pace with our competitors\u2019 product and manufacturing process innovations or cost position, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, competition between styrenic block copolymers and other products within various product applications in which we compete is intense. Increased competition from existing or newly developed SBC or non-SBC products may reduce demand for our products in the future and our customers may decide on alternate sources to meet their requirements. If we are unable to successfully compete with other producers of styrenic block copolymers or if other products can be successfully substituted for our products, our sales may decline.\nIf we are not able to continue the technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other producers to meet their requirements.\nOur industry and the markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In addition, our customers may introduce new generations of their own products or require new technological and increased performance specifications that would require us to develop customized products. Innovation or other changes in our customers\u2019 product performance requirements may also adversely affect the demand for our products. Our future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key markets, and upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and sell products in such changing markets. In order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position, we must continue to identify, develop and market innovative products on a timely basis to replace existing products. We may not be successful in developing new products and technology that successfully compete with newly introduced products and materials, and our customers may not accept, or may have lower demand for, any of our new products. Further, an important part of our strategy is the creation of demand for innovations that we develop and introduce to the markets. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations, fail to modify our products in response to our customers\u2019 needs or fail to develop innovations that generate additional demand, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of reduced sales of our products or diminished return on investment in innovations.\nOur business relies on intellectual property and other proprietary information, and our failure to protect our rights could harm our competitive advantages with respect to the manufacturing of some of our products.\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property and other proprietary information relating to our business. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property and other proprietary information without our authorization or from independently developing intellectual property and other proprietary information that is similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as in the United States. The use of our intellectual property and other proprietary\ninformation by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, potentially causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. If it becomes necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail.\nIn addition, we acquired a significant number of patents from Shell Chemicals. According to the agreements with Shell Chemicals relating to their contribution of these patents to us and our ownership of these patents, Shell Chemicals retained for itself fully-transferable and exclusive licenses to their use outside of the elastomers business, as well as fully-transferable non-exclusive licenses within the field of elastomers for certain limited uses in non-competing activities. Shell Chemicals is permitted to sublicense these rights. Shell Chemicals also retains the right to enforce these patents outside the elastomers field and recover any damages resulting from these actions.\nOur patent applications and issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties. Our competitors may also attempt to design around our patents or copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property and other proprietary information. Moreover, our competitors may already hold or have applied for patents in the United States or abroad that, if enforced or issued, could possibly prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to manufacture or sell one or more of our products in the United States or abroad. With respect to our pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims. Our failure to secure these patents may limit our ability to protect inventions that these applications were intended to cover. In addition, the expiration of a patent can result in increased competition with consequent erosion of profit margins.\nIt is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets, but our confidentiality agreements could be breached or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise. Adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition. In addition, others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.\nThe applicable governmental authorities may not approve our pending service mark and trademark applications. A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries could limit our ability to obtain and retain our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. Moreover, third parties may seek to oppose our applications or otherwise challenge the resulting registrations. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands.\nThe failure of our patents, trademarks or confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information, including our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets, trade names and proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods and compounds, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive advantages over other producers.\nOur products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.\nMany of our competitors have a substantial amount of intellectual property. We cannot guarantee that our processes and products do not and will not infringe issued patents (whether present or future) or other intellectual property rights belonging to others, including, without limitation, situations in which our products, processes or technologies may be covered by patent applications filed by other parties in the United States or abroad.\nFrom time to time, we oppose patent applications that we consider overbroad or otherwise invalid in order to maintain the necessary freedom to operate fully in our various business lines without the risk of being sued for patent infringement. If, however, patents are subsequently issued on any such applications by other parties, or if patents belonging to others already exist that cover our products, processes or technologies, we could be liable for infringement or have to take other remedial or curative actions to continue our manufacturing and sales activities with respect to one or more products.\nWe may also be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from operating our business.\nIf we were to discover that our processes, technologies or products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of others, we might need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages\nand/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. If we incur significant costs to litigate our intellectual property rights or to obtain licenses, or if our inability to obtain required licenses for our processes, technologies or products prevents us from selling our products , our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA major failure of our information systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business. We may experience operating problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer \u201chackers\u201d or other causes. If our systems for protecting against these risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or customer data, having our business operations interrupted, and increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate attacks on our systems. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause customers to cancel orders or cause standard business processes to become inefficient or ineffective, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to seasonality that may affect our quarterly operating results and impact the market price of our common stock.\nSeasonal changes and weather conditions typically affect our sales for paving and roofing applications. In particular, sales volumes for paving products generally rise in the warmer months and generally decline during the colder months of fall and winter. Roofing product sales volumes tend to be more consistent throughout the year. In addition, abnormally cold or wet seasons may cause reduced purchases from our Paving and Roofing customers. However, because seasonal weather patterns are difficult to predict, we cannot accurately estimate fluctuations in our quarterly Paving and Roofing sales in any given year. If Paving and Roofing results cause our operating results to fall below the periodic expectations of financial analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nSubstantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $350.0 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding in the form of senior unsecured notes. Additionally, we have entered into an asset-based revolving credit facility consisting of a $150.0 million U.S. senior secured revolving credit facility and a $100.0 million Dutch senior secured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2014, the facilities were undrawn, and available borrowing capacity was $191.6 million. We may request up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of additional revolving facility commitments of which up to an aggregate of $40.0 million may be additional Dutch revolving facility commitments, provided that we satisfy additional conditions described in the senior secured credit facilities, and provided further that the U.S. revolver commitment is at least 60% of the commitments after giving effect to such increase. Furthermore, our KFPC joint venture executed a syndicated loan agreement in the amount of 5.5 billion NTD, or $173.1 million (converted at the December 31, 2014 exchange rate), to provide additional funding to construct the HSBC facility in Taiwan and to provide funding for working capital requirements and/or general corporate purposes. Formosa Petrochemical Corporation and Kraton Polymers LLC are the guarantors of the KFPC Loan Agreement with each guarantor guaranteeing fifty percent (50%) of the indebtedness.\nAlthough the terms of our senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the senior notes and the KFPC Loan Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and additional indebtedness that we may incur from time to time to finance projects or for other reasons in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we and our restricted subsidiaries incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.\nOur indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nincrease the risk that we breach financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt agreements, which can be exacerbated by volatility in the cost of our monomers and the resulting impact on our earnings;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and lease obligations; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes or to refinance our existing debt.\nOur ability to pay principal of and interest on indebtedness, fund working capital and make anticipated capital expenditures depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the senior secured credit facilities to fund liquidity needs, including debt service. Furthermore, if we decide to undertake additional investments in existing or new facilities, this will likely require additional capital, and there can be no assurance that this capital will be available.\nOur debt instruments, including our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes, impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and affect our ability to access liquidity.\nOur senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. Under the terms of our senior secured credit facilities, we are subject to a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 if availability under the facilities is below specified amounts. In addition, our senior secured credit facilities and indenture include restrictions on our ability to, in certain circumstances, among other things:\n\u2022\nplace liens on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments other than permitted investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or dissolve;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nchange our or our subsidiaries\u2019 fiscal year or organizational documents; and\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments (including certain equity issuances).\nA failure by us or our subsidiaries to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in the agreements. Further, an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one instrument may constitute an event of default under another instrument. If any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nChemical manufacturing is inherently hazardous, which could result in accidents that disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses or liabilities.\nHazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes exist in our operations and the operations of other occupants with whom we share manufacturing sites. These hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations and have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on us as a whole. These potential risks include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022\npipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures;\n\u2022\nexplosions and fires;\n\u2022\ninclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks;\n\u2022\nmechanical failure; and\n\u2022\nchemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases.\nThese hazards may result in personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including governmental fines, expenses for remediation and claims brought by governmental entities or third parties. The loss or\nshutdown of operations over an extended period at our Belpre facility, which is our largest manufacturing facility, or any of our other major operating facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our property, business interruption and casualty insurance may not fully insure us against all potential hazards incidental to our business.\nWe may be liable for damages based on product liability claims brought against our customers.\nMany of our products provide critical performance attributes to our customers\u2019 products that are sold to consumers who could potentially bring product liability suits in which we could be named as a defendant. The sale of these products entails the risk of product liability claims. If a person were to bring a product liability suit against one of our customers, the customer may attempt to seek contribution from us. A person may also bring a product liability claim directly against us. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us in excess of our insurance coverage, for which we are not otherwise indemnified, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect ourselves from product liability claims in this regard will ultimately protect us from any such claims.\nAs a global business, we are exposed to local business risks in different countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in foreign countries, including manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations. Currently, we operate, or others operate on our behalf, facilities in Brazil, Germany, France and Japan, in addition to our operations in the United States. Furthermore, we are a 50/50 joint venture partner with FPCC to build, own and operate a 30 kiloton HSBC plant at FPCC\u2019s petrochemical site in Mailiao, Taiwan.\nOur foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022\nnew and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nexport duties or import quotas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign customs and tariffs or other trade barriers;\n\u2022\npotential staffing difficulties and labor disputes;\n\u2022\nrisk of non-compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery legislation in other countries by agents or other third-party representatives;\n\u2022\nmanaging and obtaining support and distribution for local operations;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of transportation or shipping;\n\u2022\ncredit risk and financial conditions of local customers and distributors;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrisk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;\n\u2022\npotential imposition of restrictions on investments;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlocal political and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries; and\n\u2022\ncivil unrest, including labor unrest, in response to local political conditions.\nWe may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing risks in a timely and effective manner at each location where we do business. Consequently, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with extensive environmental, health and safety laws could require material expenditures, changes in our operations or site remediation.\nMaterials such as butadiene, styrene and isoprene, which are used in the manufacture of our products, can represent potentially significant health and safety concerns. Our products are also used in a variety of applications that have specific regulatory requirements such as those relating to products that have contact with food or are used for medical applications.\nWe use large quantities of hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing operations. Consequently, our operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at the international, national, state and local level in multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management, site remediation programs and chemical use and management. Many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent over time and the costs of compliance with these requirements may increase, including costs associated with any necessary capital investments. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal and, in some circumstances, revocation. The necessary permits may not be issued or continue in effect, and renewals of any issued permits may contain significant new requirements or restrictions. The nature of the chemical industry exposes us to risks of liability due to the use, production, management, storage, transportation and sale of materials that are heavily regulated or hazardous and can cause contamination or personal injury or damage if released into the environment.\nBecause of the nature of our operations, we could be subject to legislation and regulation affecting the emission of greenhouse gases. In the last five years, the EPA promulgated regulations applicable to projects involving greenhouse gas emissions above a certain threshold, and the U.S. and certain states within the U.S. have enacted, or are considering, limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. Jurisdictions outside the U.S. are also addressing greenhouse gases by legislation or regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made at the international level toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global greenhouse gas emissions. These requirements to limit greenhouse gas emissions may require us to incur capital investments to upgrade our operations to comply with any future greenhouse gas emissions controls. While the impact of any such legislation, regulation, treaties or protocols is currently speculative, any such legislation, regulation, treaties or protocols, if enacted, may have an adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Further, some scientific studies on the effect of the emission of greenhouse gases on climate suggest that adverse weather events may become stronger or more frequent in the future in certain of the areas in which we operate, although the scientific studies are not unanimous. Due to their location, some of our operations may be vulnerable to operational and structural damages resulting from hurricanes and other severe weather systems. Our insurance may not cover all associated losses. We are taking steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, but no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations generally increases the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, as well as the costs of storage and disposal of wastes. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements.\nRegulation of our employees\u2019 exposure to butadiene could require material expenditures or changes in our operations.\nButadiene is a known carcinogen in laboratory animals at high doses and is being studied for its potential adverse health effects. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration limits the permissible employee exposure to butadiene. Future studies on the health effects of butadiene may result in additional regulations or new regulations in Europe that further restrict or prohibit the use of, and exposure to, butadiene. Additional regulation of butadiene could require us to change our operations, and these changes could affect the quality of our products and materially increase our costs.\nWe may be subject to losses due to lawsuits arising out of environmental damage or personal injuries associated with chemical manufacturing.\nWe face the risk that individuals could, in the future, seek damages for personal injury due to exposure to chemicals at our facilities or to chemicals otherwise owned or controlled by us. We may be subject to future claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers\u2019 compensation and other matters that are filed after the date of our acquisition of Shell Chemicals\u2019 elastomers business. While Shell Chemicals has agreed to indemnify us for certain claims brought with respect to matters occurring before our separation from Shell Chemicals in February 2001, those indemnity obligations are subject to limitations, and we cannot be certain that those indemnities will be sufficient to satisfy claims against us. In addition, we face the risk that future claims would fall outside of the scope of the indemnity due either to the limitations on the indemnity or to their arising from events and circumstances occurring after February 2001. Finally, under certain of the lease and operating agreements under which LyondellBasell leases and provides services to our sites in Wesseling, Germany, and Berre, France, we are required to indemnify LyondellBasell in certain circumstances, including in certain circumstances for loss and damages resulting from LyondellBasell\u2019s negligence in performing their obligations.\nSome environmental laws could impose on us the entire cost of clean-up of contamination present at a facility even though we did not cause the contamination. These laws often identify the site owner as one of the parties that can be jointly and severally liable for on-site remediation, regardless of fault or whether the original activity was legal at the time it occurred. For example, our Belpre, Ohio, facility is the subject of a required remediation program to clean up past contamination at the site and at an adjacent creek and we are a party to that site clean-up order. While Shell Chemicals has posted financial assurance of\n$5.2 million for this program and has taken the lead in implementing the program, we may incur costs and be required to take action under this program. Similarly, the Shell Chemicals indemnity for remediation at the Belpre facility may not cover all claims that might be brought against us.\nOur Paulinia, Brazil, facility also has on-site contamination resulting from past operations of Shell Chemicals. Although an indemnity from Shell Chemicals covers claims related to specified areas within the facility, we may be required to undertake and pay for remediation of these and other areas. The indemnity coverage from Shell Chemicals is limited in time and amount and we cannot rely upon it to cover possible future claims for on-site contamination separate from the areas specified in the indemnity. The Paulinia facility is also adjacent to a former Shell Chemicals site where we believe past manufacturing of hydrocarbons resulted in significant contamination of soil and groundwater and required relocation of nearby residents. It is our understanding that the Shell Chemicals portion of the site has changed ownership several times, which may impact financial responsibility for contamination on the site. While we are not aware of any significant contamination at our Paulinia facility, we could potentially be the subject of claims related to pesticide contamination and effects at some point in the future.\nIn general, there is always the possibility that a third-party plaintiff or claimant, or governmental or regulatory authority, could seek to include us in an action or claim for damages, clean-up, or remediation pertaining to events or circumstances occurring or existing at one or more of our sites prior to the time of our ownership or occupation of the applicable site. In the event that any of these actions or claims were asserted against us, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to litigation arising from the termination of the Combination Agreement with LCY Chemical Corp.\nOn October 6, 2014, we and two of our subsidiaries, Kraton Performance Polymers Limited and NY MergerCo, LLC, were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by LCY Chemical Corp. and its subsidiary, LCY Synthetic Rubber Corp. (together, the \u201cLCY Parties\u201d), in connection with the previously announced termination of the Combination Agreement. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract by Kraton and seeks payment of the $25 million termination fee, along with awards of unspecified comepensatory, expectancy and consequential damages. If this lawsuit is ultimately decided against us, we may be required to pay a significant amount of money to the LCY parties.\nRegulatory and statutory changes applicable to us or our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and many of the applications for the products in the markets in which we sell our products are regulated by various national and local rules, laws and regulations. Changes in any of these areas could result in additional compliance costs, seizures, confiscations, recall or monetary fines, any of which could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products. For example, changes in environmental regulations restricting the use of disposable diapers could cause a decline in sales to producers of that product. In addition, we benefit from certain trade protections, including anti-dumping protection. If we were to lose these protections, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to customs, international trade, export control, antitrust, zoning and occupancy and labor and employment laws that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including customs and international trade laws, export control, antitrust laws and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of factories and warehouse facilities and our relationship with our customers, suppliers and competitors. If these regulations were to change or were violated by our management, employees, suppliers, buying agents or trading companies, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our products and hurt our business and negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nLegal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effects on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly impact our results of operations and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nOur operations are conducted by our subsidiaries in many countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The main currencies to which we are exposed,\nbesides the U.S. dollar, are the Euro, Japanese Yen and Brazilian Real. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. A depreciation of these currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts derived from these operations reported in our consolidated financial statements and an appreciation of these currencies will result in a corresponding increase in such amounts. Because many of our raw material costs are determined with respect to the U.S. dollar rather than these currencies, depreciation of these currencies may have an adverse effect on our profit margins or our reported results of operations. Conversely, to the extent that we are required to pay for goods or services in foreign currencies, the appreciation of such currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations between financial periods.\nWe incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. From time to time, we use hedging strategies to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction risks, that our hedging activities will be effective or that any volatility in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes and state taxes in the U.S., as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different to that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Should any tax authority take issue with our estimates, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur formation of a joint venture to expand HSBC capacity in Asia is subject to risks and uncertainties.\nWe are a 50/50 joint venture partner with FPCC to build, own and operate a 30 kiloton HSBC plant at FPCC\u2019s petrochemical site in Mailiao, Taiwan. Construction of the HSBC plant is ongoing; however, the plant may not be successfully constructed and operated within our expected timeframe or budget or yield expected results. In addition, the project remains subject to numerous known and unknown contingencies, including material governmental approvals and permitting; cost and availability of raw materials, labor and financing; weather and operational delays; and economic, political and other disruptions. If any of these risks materialize, our prospects in Asia and as a result, our ability to meet demand for HSBC products could be materially adversely affected.\nIn January 2014, a group of local residents in Mailiao, Taiwan, sued the Taiwanese Executive Yuan (the executive branch of the Taiwanese government) to overturn an appeal decision rendered by the Executive Yuan in which it had overturned a prior ruling of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. The Taiwan EPA ruling in question required the inclusion of restrictive conditions relating to FPCC\u2019s entire petrochemical site in Mailiao, Taiwan, which is the site of our joint venture with FPCC, in the environmental permit for the construction of the HSBC plant by our joint venture company. Neither we nor our joint venture is a party to the proceedings, nor do we or our joint venture have any right under Taiwan law to join the proceedings. The court in the proceeding has issued a ruling that could reinstate the restrictive conditions in FPCC\u2019s environmental permit. The Executive Yuan and FPCC have appealed the ruling. The ruling conflicts with the prior appeal decision of the Executive Yuan, and if the ruling is not overturned, it could adversely impact the ability of the joint venture to obtain material operating permits in the future.\nOur relationship with our employees could deteriorate, which could adversely affect our operations.\nAs a manufacturing company, we rely on our employees and good relations with our employees to produce our products and maintain our production processes and productivity. We had 934 full-time employees as of December 31, 2014. A significant number of our non-U.S. employees are subject to arrangements similar to collective bargaining arrangements. With respect to these employees, we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms, and actions by our employees may disrupt our business. If these workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, our operations could be disrupted or we could experience higher labor costs. In addition, if our other employees were to become unionized, in particular our employees at our Belpre, Ohio, facility, we could experience significant operating disruptions and higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations. Because many of the personnel who operate our European facilities are employees of LyondellBasell, relations between LyondellBasell and its employees may also adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nOur success in the highly competitive markets in which we operate will continue to depend to a significant extent on our key employees. We are dependent on the expertise of our executive officers. Loss of the services of any of our executive\nofficers could have an adverse effect on our prospects. We may not be able to retain our key employees or to recruit qualified individuals to join our company. The loss of key employees could result in high transition costs and could disrupt our operations.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers and the loss of customers could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWith some exceptions, our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders with our customers. As such, our customers could cease buying our products from us at any time, for any reason, with little or no recourse. If multiple customers elected not to purchase products from us, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA decrease in the fair value of pension assets could materially increase future funding requirements of the pension plan.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan. The total projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plan exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $54.1 million at December 31, 2014. We contributed $7.2 million to the pension plan in 2014. Among the key assumptions inherent in the actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. If discount rates or actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease, the pension plan obligation could increase materially. The size of future required pension contributions could result in our dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making the contributions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDomestic or international natural disasters or terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations, decrease the demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business.\nChemical related assets, and U.S. corporations such as ours, may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the U.S. and throughout the world. Moreover, extraordinary events such as natural disasters may negatively affect local economies, including those of our customers or suppliers. The occurrence of such events cannot be predicted, although they can be expected to continue to adversely impact the economy in general and our specific markets. The resulting damage from such an event could include loss of life, property damage or site closure. Any, or a combination, of these factors could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDelaware law and some provisions of our organizational documents make a takeover of our company more difficult.\nProvisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company. A change of control could be proposed in the form of a tender offer or takeover proposal that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in entrenchment of current management. For example, our charter and bylaws:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nrequire that the number of directors be determined, and provide that any vacancy or new board seat may be filled, only by the board;\n\u2022\ndo not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\ndo not permit stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\npermit the bylaws to be amended by a majority of the board without shareholder approval, and require that a bylaw amendment proposed by stockholders be approved by two-thirds of all outstanding shares;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, or \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, by our board of directors without shareholder approval.\nOur Kraton Performance Polymers, Inc. Executive Severance Program and the equity arrangements with our executive officers also contain change in control provisions. Under the terms of these arrangements, the executive officers are entitled to receive significant cash payments, immediate vesting of options, restricted shares and notional shares, and continued medical benefits in the event their employment is terminated under certain circumstances within one year following a change in control, and with respect to certain equity awards, within two years following a change in control.\nAny Supplemental Pension Benefits a participant may have accrued under the Kraton Polymers U.S. LLC Pension Benefit Restoration Plan also vests immediately on a change of control and any amounts accrued under the Kraton Polymers LLC Executive Deferred Compensation Plan are immediately payable upon a change of control. We disclose in proxy statements filed with the SEC potential payments to our named executive officers in connection with a change of control. Further, certain change of control transactions constitute an event of default under our credit facility and require us to repurchase our outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\nThese arrangements and provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes of control or changes in management of our company, even if such transactions or changes would have significant benefits for our stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe do not currently pay dividends and may not pay any dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently pay dividends, and we may not pay dividends to our stockholders for the foreseeable future. The senior secured credit facilities and our senior notes indenture limit our ability to pay cash dividends and may preclude us from paying cash dividends, and we may be subject to other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends from time to time. In addition, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law or the SEC and other factors our board deems relevant.\nWe are a holding company with nominal net worth and will depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to pay any dividends.\nKraton Performance Polymers, Inc. is a holding company with nominal net worth. We do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries, including Kraton Polymers LLC. As a result, our ability to pay dividends, if any, will be dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon their respective earnings and subject to any limitations on the ability of such entities to make payments or other distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make any funds available to us.", "PERMNO": 93175, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "KRA"}
