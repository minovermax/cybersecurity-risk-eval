You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you might lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our operations and business results.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a few customers. If we were to lose a key customer, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn fiscal year 2017, our top 20 customers accounted for 94% of our sales, with our current largest customer accounting for 50% of our sales. This customer has made purchase commitments to us through calendar 2018. The loss of this customer or any of our significant customers, would severely impact us, including having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations. As previously discussed, our former largest customer has informed us that they have replaced a primary product that we sell with one that they now manufacture. Therefore, although we expect to continue to have sales to this customer in fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to this customer to continue to decline.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from our core business area that, if not serviced properly, may result in a material adverse impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn fiscal year 2017, we derived 85% of our revenue from sales of our medical device products and related services. We believe that a primary factor in the market acceptance of our products and services is the value they create for our customers. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers through the timely development, successful introduction and implementation of new and enhanced products and services, while at the same time continuing to provide the value our customers have come to expect from us. We have historically expended a significant percentage of our revenue on product development and believe that significant continued product development efforts will be required to sustain our growth. Continued investment in our sales and marketing efforts will also be required to support future growth.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product development efforts, that the market will continue to accept our existing products, or that new products or product enhancements will be developed and implemented in a timely manner, meet the requirements of our customers, or achieve market acceptance. If the market does not continue to accept our existing products, or our new products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur customers may cancel or reduce their orders, change production quantities or delay production, any of which would reduce our sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nSince most of our customers purchase our products from us on a purchase order basis, they may cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us. As a result, we are not always able to forecast with certainty the sales that we will make in a given period and sometimes we may increase our inventory, working capital, and overhead in expectation of orders that may never be placed, or, if placed, may be delayed, reduced, or canceled.\nThe following factors, among others, affect our ability to forecast accurately our sales and production capacity:\n\u00b7\nChanges in the specific products or quantities our customers order; and\n\u00b7\nLong lead times and advance financial commitments for components required to complete actual/anticipated customer orders.\nDelayed, reduced or canceled purchase orders also may result in our inability to recover costs that we incur in anticipation of those orders, such as costs associated with purchased raw materials and write-offs of obsolete inventory.\nIn fiscal 2017 we invested in Monogram Orthopaedics Inc. (\u201cMonogram\u201d), a start-up technology company which requires additional funding to complete its regulatory path. If Monogram is not successful in raising the funds it needs to bring its technology to market, it could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe recently invested $450,000 in Monogram through a secured convertible promissory note, which funds shall be used as seed money to assist Monogram in progressing to its next stage of financing, which additional financing we understood will be required to allow Monogram to complete its FDA regulatory approval requirements. If Monogram is not successful in raising the additional capital it requires, we may need to impair our existing and/or future investments in Monogram, which would be adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, we have launched many new medical device products and our estimates of warranty claims are based largely on our previous history from similar legacy products and if actual warranty claims exceed our estimates, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recently completed significant medical device development projects in the craniomaxillofacial (\u201cCMF\u201d) surgical segment as well as a surgical handpiece used for orthopedic applications for which we have made estimates of product warranty claims based upon similar, legacy products. If the actual repair volumes or repair costs exceed the estimates that we have been using, we may incur additional costs which could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition from a number of different sources, which could negatively impact our results of operations and business conditions.\nThe markets for products in the industries served by our customers are intensely competitive, and we face significant competition from a number of different sources. Several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, than us.\nWe compete in all of our markets with other major surgical device and related companies. As a provider of outsourced products and services, we also compete with our customers\u2019 own internal development groups. Competitive pressures and other factors, such as new product or new technology introductions by us, our customers\u2019 internal development and manufacturing departments, or our competitors may result in price or market share erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, there can be no assurance that our products and services will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other products.\nThe industry in which we operate is subject to significant technological change and any failure or delay in addressing such change could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete.\nThe medical device market is generally characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards.\nNew product development requires significant research and development expenditures that we have historically funded through operations; however we may be unable to do so in the future. Any significant decrease in revenues or research funding could impair our ability to respond to technological advances in the marketplace and to remain competitive. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Although we continue to target new markets for access, develop new products and update existing products, there can be no assurance that we will do so successfully or that even if we are successful, such efforts will be completed concurrently with or prior to the introduction of competing products. Any such failure or delay could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete.\nWe rely heavily on our proprietary technology, which, if not properly protected or if deemed invalid, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on the maintenance and protection of our proprietary technology and rely on patent filings, exclusive development and supply agreements, confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect it. There can be no assurance that the legal protections and precautions taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies equivalent or superior to ours. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and are often not enforced as vigorously as those in the United States.\nWe do not believe that our operations or products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. However, there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims against us with respect to our current or future products. Assertions or claims by others, whether or not valid, could cause us to incur significant legal costs defending our intellectual property rights and potentially require us to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement with the party asserting the claim or to cease our use of the infringing technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTwo of our directors hold voting power with respect to a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock that enables them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, which influence may conflict with our interests and the interests of other shareholders.\nAs of August 18, 2017, two of our directors, Nicholas J. Swenson and Raymond E. Cabillot, controlled voting power over approximately 41% (27% and 14%, respectively) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of such voting control, these directors will have significant influence over all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions, and may have interests that conflict with our interests and the interests of other shareholders.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our business acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have acquired, and may acquire in the future, businesses, products, and technologies that complement or expand our current operations. Acquisitions could require significant capital investments and require us to integrate with companies that have different cultures, management teams, and business infrastructure. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the acquisition could depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, products, and workforce of an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nThe retention of key employees;\n\u00b7\nManagement of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas;\n\u00b7\nThe integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully converting information and accounting systems, and\n\u00b7\nDiversion of resources and management attention from our other operations.\nIf market conditions or other factors require us to change our strategic direction, we may fail to realize the expected value from one or more of our acquisitions. Our failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or realize the expected value from past or future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur quarterly results can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which may negatively impact the price of our shares and/or cause significant variances in the prices at which our shares trade.\nOur sales have fluctuated in the past, and may fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and period to period, as a result of a number of factors including, without limitation: the size and timing of orders from customers; the length of new product development cycles; market acceptance of new technologies; changes in pricing policies or price reductions by us or our competitors; the timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors; the financial stability of major customers; our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs; acceleration, deferral, or cancellation of customer orders and deliveries; changes in our strategy; revenue recognition policies in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d); personnel changes; and general market and economic factors.\nBecause a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed, a variation in the timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, we believe that interim period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Further, our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period.\nIn addition, it is possible that our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such an event, the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to a number of complex government regulations, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe manufacture and distribution of medical and dental devices are subject to state and federal requirements set forth by various government agencies including the FDA and EPA. The statutes, regulations, administrative orders, and advisories that affect our businesses are complex and subject to diverse, often conflicting, interpretations. While we make every effort to maintain full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to eliminate the ongoing risk that one or more of our activities may at some point be determined to be non-compliant. The penalties for non-compliance could range from an administrative warning to termination of a portion of our business. Furthermore, even if we are subsequently determined to have fully complied with applicable laws or regulations, the costs to achieve such a determination and the intervening loss of business could adversely affect or result in the cessation of a portion of our business. A change in such laws or regulations at any time may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe FDA designates all medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device (with Class I requiring the lowest level of control and Class III requiring the greatest level of control). The surgical instrumentation we manufacture is generally classified into Class I, and our dental instrumentation is generally classified into Class II. The FDA has broad enforcement powers to recall and prohibit the sale of products that do not comply with federal regulations, and to order the cessation of non-compliant processes. No claim has been made to date by the FDA regarding any of our products or processes. Nevertheless, as is common in the industry, certain of our products and processes are from time to time subject to routine governmental reviews and investigations. We are also subject to EPA regulations concerning the disposal of industrial waste.\nWhile management believes that our products and processes fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the outcome of any such future review or investigation.\nWe face increased costs in the healthcare industry due to government reform.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. The Affordable Care Act enacted sweeping reforms to the U.S. healthcare industry, including mandatory health insurance, reforms to Medicare and Medicaid, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, new taxes on medical equipment manufacturers, currently suspended through 2017, that apply to certain of our products and other significant modifications to the healthcare delivery system.\nThe global economic environment may impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nChanges in the global economic environment have caused, and may cause in the future, a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition should they cause, for example, current or potential customers to become unable to fund purchases of our products, in turn resulting in delays, decreases or cancellations of purchases of our products and services, or causing the customer to not pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. In addition, financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to obtain financing for our operations, investing activities (including the financing of any future acquisitions), or financing activities. Additional economic risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe face risks and uncertainties associated with potential litigation by or against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually face the possibility of litigation as either a plaintiff or a defendant. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the awards or damages, or the range of awards or damages, if any, that we might incur in connection with such litigation.\nMany of our products are complex and technologically advanced. Such products may, from time to time, be the subject of claims concerning product performance and construction, including warranty claims. While we are committed to correcting such problems as soon as possible, there is no assurance that solutions will be found on a timely basis, if at all, to satisfy customer demands or to avoid potential claims or litigation. Also, due to the location of our facilities, as well as the nature of our business activities, there is a risk that we could be subject to litigation related to environmental remediation claims. We maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the manufacture and use of our products as well as environmental pollution, but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any claim asserted against us.\nThe uncertainty associated with potential litigation may have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, litigation could impair our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers. Defending or prosecuting litigation could result in significant legal costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from business operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that litigation would not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nOur operations are dependent upon our key personnel. If such personnel were to leave unexpectedly, we may not be able to execute our business plan.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel. Because we have a relatively small number of employees when compared to other companies in the same industry, our dependence on maintaining our relationship with key employees is particularly significant. We are also dependent on our ability to attract and retain high quality personnel, particularly in the areas of product development, operations management, marketing and finance.\nA high level of employee mobility and the aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel characterize the medical device industry. There can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us. Loss of services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may need to provide enhanced forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain such key personnel.\nWe have experienced losses in the past, and we cannot be certain that we will sustain our current profitability; we may need additional capital in the future to fund our businesses, which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms.\nWe have experienced operating losses in the past. Although we were profitable in fiscal 2017 and 2016, we incurred pre-tax losses from continuing operations of $446,000, $755,000, and $1,903,000 in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our ability to achieve or sustain profitability is based on a number of factors, many of which are out of our control, including the material costs for our products and the demand for our products.\nWe currently anticipate that our available capital resources, including our existing cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable balances will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements as our business is currently conducted for at least the next 12 months. We may also attempt to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such financings become available on acceptable terms. We cannot be certain that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of opportunities, develop new products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, compliance with which could be costly and time consuming.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting standards that govern the measurement of our performance. Based on our reading and interpretations of relevant pronouncements, guidance, or concepts issued by, among other authorities, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, management believes our performance, including current sales contract terms and business arrangements, has been properly reported. However, there continue to be issued pronouncements, interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the industries in which we operate. Future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices may result in future changes in our accounting policies and practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations.\nOur evaluation of internal controls and remediation of potential problems is costly and time consuming and could expose weaknesses in financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, requires management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This process is expensive and time consuming, and requires significant attention of management. Management can give no assurance that material weaknesses in internal controls will not be discovered. If a material weakness is discovered, corrective action may be time consuming and costly, and could further divert the attention of management. The disclosure of a material weakness, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price, especially if a restatement of financial statements for past periods is required.", "PERMNO": 10550, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "PDEX"}
