{"cik": "1324189", "company": "Orchids Paper Products CO /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our operations. The risks, uncertainties and other factors set forth below may cause our actual results, performances or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. If any of these risks or events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. The risk factors set forth below are not exhaustive and are not the only risks that may affect our business. Our business could also be affected by additional risks not currently known to us or described below. We may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time in other reports we file with the SEC in the future.\nRisks Related to our Chapter 11 Filings\nOur voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and our ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, leaner company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re Orchids Paper Products Company, et al. (Case No. 19-10729 (MFW)). We will continue to operate our business as \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nOn April 1, 2019, we filed the Option and the Asset Purchase Agreement as part of a motion to approve bid procedures, and ultimately the sale to the successful bidder at the auction, with the Bankruptcy Court. In addition to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, the Asset Purchase Agreement is subject to certain conditions that must be satisfied before the Sale Transaction may be consummated. Although we believe that the Asset Purchase Agreement will satisfy all requirements for approval under the Bankruptcy Code, there can be no assurance that the Asset Purchase Agreement will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court or that the conditions precedent to its implementation will be satisfied or when, if ever, such approval and satisfaction will occur. Failure to obtain such approval or to satisfy such conditions to implementation may result in lengthier bankruptcy proceedings as we attempt to negotiate and implement an alternative arrangement.\nWe cannot predict whether or when we will successfully emerge from bankruptcy. The Chapter 11 Cases may affect our relationship with our creditors, customers, suppliers and employees and have a significant impact on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to continue to operate in bankruptcy will depend on various factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to comply with and operate under the terms of any cash management orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time, which subject us to restrictions on transferring cash and other assets;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand and to generate cash from operations throughout the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u00b7 our ability to fund emergence and to fund our operations after emergence from the bankruptcy process on reasonable terms;\n\u00b7 our ability to retain key employees during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain good customer and supplier relationships in light of developments in our bankruptcy proceedings and our ability to manage contracts that are critical to our operations; and\n\u00b7 risks associated with third party motions in Chapter 11 proceedings, which may interfere with the consummation of the Sale Transaction.\nOur businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the loss of customers and suppliers.\nDifficulties of providing services during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases may make it more difficult to maintain and promote our services and attract customers to our services and to keep our suppliers. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience collection issues with otherwise valid receivables of certain customers. Adverse resolution of these disagreements may impact our revenues and other costs of services, both prospectively and retroactively. It is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact of these disagreements. Our suppliers, vendors and services providers may require stricter terms and conditions. The loss of any of our customers or suppliers during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may experience other adverse effects, including, without limitation, a loss of confidence by current and prospective suppliers. Any failure to timely obtain suitable supplies at competitive prices could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional qualified personnel, which could materially affect our business and require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles. This uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel.\nAny failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases have required and will continue to require a substantial amount of time and attention of our senior management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases have required and will continue to require a substantial portion of time and attention from our senior management team and leave them with less time to devote to the operations of our business. Our management has spent considerable time participating in the development of restructuring plans and the business plan for the Company. This diversion of management\u2019s attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted.\nFailure to consummate the Sale Transaction may result in liquidation or an alternative plan on less favorable terms to holders of claims against us.\nIf the Asset Purchase Agreement is not approved or the Sale Transaction is not consummated, or if the Company determines not to exercise the Option, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases will continue rather than be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases, or that any alternative purchase agreement or plan of reorganization would be on terms as favorable to holders of claims against us as the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Certain parties in interest may file objections to the Asset Purchase Agreement in an effort to persuade the Bankruptcy Court not to approve the Asset Purchase Agreement. Although we believe that the Asset Purchase Agreement, or in the alternative another successful bid for the Company\u2019s assets at the auction, will meet the requirements for approval, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.\nIf a liquidation or protracted reorganization were to occur, the distributions to holders of claims may be materially reduced. In a liquidation under Chapter 7, holders of claims could receive substantially less because of the inability in a liquidation to realize the greater going-concern value of our assets. Administrative expenses of a liquidation or a protracted reorganization could also cause a substantial erosion of the value of our business. Substantial additional claims against us may also arise by reason of a protracted reorganization or liquidation, including from the rejection or other breach of previously assumed unexpired leases and other executory contracts, thereby further reducing distributions to holders of claims against us.\nIn addition, even if our cases are not converted to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, if we are unable to timely obtain approval of and consummate the Sale Transaction, we may be forced to operate in bankruptcy for an extended period of time while we try to negotiate a different sale transaction or formulate a plan of reorganization. Such a scenario could jeopardize our relationships with key vendors and suppliers, customers and employees, which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our operations. A material deterioration in our operations likely would diminish recoveries under any subsequent Chapter 11 plan.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with the financial maintenance or other covenants in our DIP Facility, which could result in an event of default under the credit agreements governing the DIP Facility that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe DIP Facility contains certain milestone requirements relating to various steps in the Sale Transaction process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy such milestones. Should we fail to satisfy the milestones in the DIP Facility, such failure could have significant adverse consequences for us. The DIP Facility also provides specific financial maintenance and restrictive covenants. If we breach any such covenants and such breach is not cured or waived, the DIP Lender:\n\u00b7 would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us; and/or\n\u00b7 could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under such DIP Facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, due and payable and could demand cash collateral for all letters of credit issued thereunder;\neither of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf conditions to the Asset Purchase Agreement are not satisfied or waived, the Sale Transaction may not be consummated.\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement provides for certain conditions that must be satisfied (or waived) prior to its effective date, including among others, (i) the approval by the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases; (ii) the accuracy of representations and warranties of the parties; (iii) the aggregate liability to cure pre-petition claims under transferred contracts being less than $1 million; (iv) the aggregate liability of accounts payable to be assumed by OI being less than $2.5 million; (v) the continuity of certain of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers and (vi) material compliance with the obligations set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Certain of the conditions are outside of our control.\nIn the event that such conditions are not satisfied (or waived), there can be no assurance that the Sale Transaction would be consummated or that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases, or that a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Debtors as the Asset Purchase Agreement and Sale Transaction.\nAs noted above, under certain scenarios, the Chapter 11 Cases could be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, which could result in liquidation of our assets.\nIf the Asset Purchase Agreement is not approved, the Sale Transaction is not consummated, the Company determines not to exercise the Option, or if the Bankruptcy Court otherwise finds that it would be in the best interest of our creditors, any of the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. A liquidation under Chapter 7 could result in no distributions being made to unsecured creditors and smaller distributions being made to our secured lenders than those that would occur pursuant to the Sale Transaction because of (a) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of time, rather than our businesses being reorganized as a going concern; (b) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a trustee; and (c) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, which would be generated during the liquidation, and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of our operations.\nTrading in our securities during the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. It is probable that our common stock will be canceled and that holders of common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nAt this time it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business, various creditors and security holders, or if and when it may be possible to emerge from bankruptcy. We believe that under any bankruptcy process our common stock will be substantially diluted or canceled in its entirety and the holders thereof will not be entitled to receive, and will not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of these equity interests, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding equity securities will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding common stock would likely have no value. Trading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of such securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our financial results may be volatile as asset impairments, sales and other dispositions, restructuring activities, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance most likely will not be indicative of our financial performance after April 1, 2019, the date of our bankruptcy filing. In addition, if we emerge from bankruptcy, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements most likely will change materially relative to historical consolidated financial statements.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe have significant indebtedness, which subjects us to restrictive covenants relating to the operation of our business.\nPrior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we were a highly leveraged company. As a result of the construction of our integrated converting facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, consisting of two converting lines, a converting building, a paper mill building, a paper machine capable of producing structured tissue, equipment capable of utilizing recycled paper, warehouse facilities, and other supporting equipment and facility-space at a total cost of $165 million, our indebtedness has significantly increased. At December 31, 2018, we had $192.2 million of indebtedness. In 2019, under the terms of our existing loan agreements, we anticipate making contractual principal payments of $14.4 million, interest payments in excess of $30 million, and payments for debt issuance costs of approximately $3.7 million. Operating with this amount of leverage may require us to direct a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt, which reduces the funds otherwise available for operations, capital expenditures, payment of dividends, the pursuit of future business opportunities and other corporate purposes. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and may impair our ability to obtain additional financing.\nThe terms of our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with U.S. Bank National Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d) restrict our ability to incur additional debt, place liens on our assets, make capital expenditures, effect mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets or pay dividends in certain circumstances. At December 31, 2018, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants under our Credit Agreement or our Loan Agreement for New Markets Tax Credit financing (the \u201cNMTC Loan Agreement\u201d), and obtained a waiver from our lender.\nOn January 25, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 11 to the Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the Prepetition Agent (as successor to U.S. Bank National Association), and the Prepetition Secured Lender (as successor to the lenders party thereto), and Amendment No. 8 to the NMTC Loan Agreement by and between the Company and the Prepetition Secured Lender (as successor to U.S. Bank National Association), which provided waivers of covenant defaults, deferred future interest and principal payments until May 1, 2019, amended the pricing schedule, and amended certain reporting and forecast requirements.\nThe amendment to the Credit Agreement also, among other things,:\n\u00b7 sets the commitment fee rate at 3.55% and the base rate at 13.5%, in each case regardless of the then-current Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and provides that all outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement shall be converted to, and any revolving loans made in the future shall, bear interest at the base rate;\n\u00b7 eliminates the obligation of the Prepetition Secured Lender to issue any letters of credit to the Company; and\n\u00b7 provides that the Company will not permit Net Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for any week to be more than 10% less than the projected Net Cash Flow as set forth in the cash flow forecast that includes such week\nFurthermore, the most recent amendment to the Credit Agreement included a covenant that we would deliver by March 1, 2019 either (i) an executed purchase agreement for the sale of our equity or assets or (ii) a binding commitment from institutional lenders to refinance our debt obligations, in either case in an amount sufficient to repay our debt obligations to our existing Lender in full; and that we would consummate such transaction by May 1, 2019.\nThe DIP Facility also contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend or waive the covenants contained in, the DIP Facility, the DIP Lender would have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness under the DIP Facility. Our ability to generate cash or refinance our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including payments under the DIP Facility, will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future and our ability to borrow under the DIP Facility, to the extent of available borrowings. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If adverse regional and national economic conditions persist, worsen, or fail to improve significantly, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in wholesale and consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations that we are subject to under our indebtedness.\nBased on current and expected level of operations, we believe cash flow from operations, available cash, and available borrowings under the DIP Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the DIP Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nRestrictive covenants in the DIP Facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe DIP Facility limits our ability, to among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, sell our assets, incur liens, or consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. The DIP Facility also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our credit agreements. If a default occurs, the holders of these instruments may elect to declare all borrowings thereunder outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The DIP Lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness.\nThe DIP Lender may not fund its commitments.\nThere can be no assurance that deterioration in the credit markets or overall economy will not affect the ability of the DIP Lender to meet its funding commitments under the DIP Facility. If the DIP Lender fails to honor its commitment under the DIP Facility, that portion of the credit facilities will be unavailable to the extent it is not replaced by a new commitment from an alternate lender.\nAdditionally, our lenders have the ability to transfer their commitments to other institutions, and the risk that committed funds may not be available under distressed market conditions could be exacerbated if consolidation of the commitments under our revolving credit facilities or among its lenders were to occur.\nOur credit facilities have been amended for each of the last nine quarters. If we fail to meet these financial ratios and covenants and our Lender does not waive them, we may be required to pay fees and penalties, and our Lender could accelerate the maturity of our debt and proceed against any pledged collateral and /or force us to seek alternative financing, which could adversely affect our business operations and/or liquidity. If this were to happen, we may be unable to obtain additional financing or it may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nOur indebtedness is secured by all or substantially all of our assets. Therefore, if we default on any of our debt obligations, it could result in our Lender foreclosing on our assets. In such an event, the Lender\u2019s rights to such assets would likely be superior to those of our stockholders.\nWe may have insufficient liquidity to successfully operate our businesses.\nWe expect to incur significant costs as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, and our business is capital intensive. We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to maintain our equipment and comply with environmental laws, as well as to enhance the efficiency of our operations.\nWe are currently financing our operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases using cash on hand, borrowings under the DIP Facility, and cash generated by operations which constitutes cash collateral pursuant to, and in accordance with, final cash collateral orders which were agreed to by our secured lenders and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In the event that we are unable to meet the requirements for borrowing under the DIP Facility or lose our authority to use cash collateral and we do not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations such that we need to obtain additional financing, there can be no assurance as to our ability to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all. The challenges of obtaining financing, if necessary, would be exacerbated by adverse conditions in the general economy and volatility and tightness in the financial and credit markets. These conditions and our Chapter 11 Cases would make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our facilities and equipment as we require or as necessary to successfully operate our business or to ensure regulatory compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe consumer market for private label tissue products is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater financial, managerial, sales and marketing and capital resources than we do, which may allow them to respond more quickly to new opportunities or changes in customer requirements. These competitors may also be larger in size or scope than us, which may allow them to achieve greater economies of scale or allow them to better withstand periods of declining prices and adverse operating conditions.\nBy promoting their branded products, brand-competitors may erode private label tissue sales. Three large companies, Proctor and Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, and Georgia Pacific, have material shares of the brand-market in the United States, and their size may allow them to achieve greater economies of scale or allow them to better withstand adverse competition, declining prices, and adverse operating conditions. As a general business observation, consumers seem to prefer branded products over private-label unless a greater value proposition is perceived, hence competition between brands and private label can be intense.\nOur ability to successfully compete depends upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf aggressive pricing by competitors, which may force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;\n\u25cf our ability to improve plant efficiencies and operating rates and lower average manufacturing costs;\n\u25cf the availability, quality and cost of labor and raw materials, particularly recycled fiber; and\n\u25cf the cost of energy.\nOur tissue paper products are commodity products, and if we do not maintain competitive prices, we may lose significant market share. Our ability to keep our prices at competitive levels depends in large part on our ability to control our costs. In addition, consolidation among retailers may put additional pressure on us to reduce our prices in order to maintain market share. If we are unable to effectively adjust our cost structure to address such increased competitive pressures, our sales level and profitability could be harmed and our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur exposure to variable interest rates may affect our financial health.\nDebt incurred under our existing revolving credit and most of our term loan agreements have historically accrued interest at a variable rate. Specifically, our interest was calculated on a variable base rate plus a specified margin, which was dependent on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended). As of December 31, 2018, amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at 12.25%, which was comprised of a variable base rate plus a specified margin of 6.75%. Our weighted average interest rate was 11.9% at December 31, 2018, compared to a weighted average interest rate of 7.3% at December 31, 2017. As of January 23, 2019, amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a base rate of 13.5%, as defined in Amendment No. 11 to the Credit Agreement. Any increase in the interest rates on our debt results in higher interest expense, which requires us to dedicate more of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt and reduces funds available to us for our operations and future business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For more information on our liquidity, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nIncreased competition in our region may affect our business.\nWe have diversified regionally and by developing new channels and products. We anticipate continuing to diversify, but increased competition remains a significant risk. Private label manufacturers have announced greenfield capacity additions, principally in structured tissue lines, and capacity additions may always affect the existing business and/or delay inroads into new higher-end product and brand markets. Continued or increased competition from brands may also affect our business by diminishing consumer demand for private-label products or delaying our inroads into brand markets.\nA substantial percentage of our net sales are attributable to three large customers, any or all of which may decrease or cease purchases at any time.\nOur three largest customers, Walmart (including Sam\u2019s Club), Dollar General and Family Dollar (including its parent, Dollar Tree) accounted for 30%, 25% and 17%, respectively, of our converted product net sales in 2018. We expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future. Sales to these customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and not supply agreements. We may not be able to keep our key customers, or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us. Any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers would harm our sales and financial results. In particular, the loss of sales to one or more distribution centers would result in a sudden and significant decrease in our sales. If sales to current key customers cease or are reduced, we may not obtain sufficient orders from other customers necessary to offset any such losses or reductions.\nWe primarily use pre-consumer solid bleached sulfate paper, or SBS paper, and, to a lesser extent, virgin kraft fibers to produce parent rolls and any disruption in our supply or increase in the cost of pre-consumer SBS paper or virgin kraft could disrupt our production and harm our ability to produce tissue at competitive prices.\nWe do not produce any of the fiber we use to produce our parent rolls. We depend heavily on access to sufficient, reasonably priced quantities of fiber to manufacture our tissue products. Our paper mill is configured to convert recycled fiber, specifically SBS paper, and virgin kraft fiber into paper pulp for use in our paper production lines. Prices for SBS paper and virgin kraft have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, principally due to market imbalances between supply and demand. In addition, the market price of SBS fiber can also be influenced by market swings in the price of virgin pulp and other fiber grades. If either the available supply of SBS paper and/or virgin kraft diminishes or the demand for SBS paper and/or virgin kraft increases, it could substantially increase our cost of fiber, require us to purchase alternate fiber grades at increased costs, or cause a production slow-down or stoppage until we are able to identify new sources of fiber or reconfigure our pulping plant to process other available forms of paper fiber. We could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations should the price or supply of SBS paper and/or virgin kraft be disrupted. Further, we currently obtain all of our recycled fiber from a single supplier, Dixie Pulp and Paper, Inc. (\"Dixie\") and the majority of our virgin kraft from Itochu Pulp and Paper Corp. (\u201cItochu\u201d), Cmpc Usa, Inc. (\u201cCMPC\u201d), and SCA. If our relationship with Dixie, Itochu, CMPC or SCA is altered or terminated for any reason, we will have to seek alternative channels to obtain our recycled and virgin kraft fiber, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to make arrangements that adequately meet our needs or on reasonable terms. Furthermore, we may not be able to pass increased fiber costs on to our customers if the market does not allow us to raise the prices of our finished products.\nFabrica\u2019s failure to execute under the Supply Agreement could adversely affect our business.\nUnder the Supply Agreement with Fabrica, we have the right to purchase up to 19,800 tons of parent rolls and equivalent converting capacity for certain specified products during each twelve-month period following the effective date of the Supply Agreement, which has an initial term of twenty years. Fabrica\u2019s failure to execute under this agreement could result in our inability to service existing customers, thereby reducing sales volumes and profitability. A failure to execute would also harm the relationships we have established with those customers serviced under the Supply Agreement. Furthermore, Fabrica\u2019s failure to execute under this agreement could require us to look for other sources of capacity that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing costs and reducing profits.\nOur foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks.\nWe currently source a significant amount of our converted products from Mexico, i.e. the 19,800 tons from the Supply Agreement, and we expect to continue to do so. Accordingly, we are subject to political, legal, tax, and economic risks such as:\n\u25cf the effects of local political, labor and economic developments and unrest;\n\u25cf significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate;\n\u25cf significant changes to regulations or laws or the interpretation or enforcement of them, including with respect to tax and profit sharing matters arising out of the use of outsourced suppliers;\n\u25cf interpretations of tax codes, and resolution of tax disputes through appeal processes;\n\u25cf exchange controls and export restrictions;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations, particularly in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican Peso;\n\u25cf failure to maintain compliance with corruption and transparency statutes, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf laws or policies of foreign countries and the United States affecting trade, investment and taxation; and\n\u25cf civil disturbances, war and terrorist actions.\nThe occurrence of any one or combination of these events, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased competition and or deterioration in business conditions could adversely affect our ability to realize anticipated growth from the Fabrica Transaction.\nWe desired to acquire assets and certain operations from Fabrica with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits for us, including, among others, a competitive manufacturing cost, business and growth opportunities, and increased revenue streams. Increased competition and/or deterioration in business conditions may limit our ability to expand upon Fabrica\u2019s former business. As such, we may not be able to realize the synergies, goodwill, business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the Fabrica Transaction.\nChanges in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive marketplace, which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large format retailers and discounters. With the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including the large format retailers, may have greater bargaining power than we do. They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances, which could lead to reduced profitability. We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, and delisting of our products. If we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nExcess supply in the markets may reduce the prices we are able to charge for our products.\nNew paper machines or new converting equipment may be built or idle machines may be activated by other paper companies, which would add more capacity to the tissue markets. Increased production capacity could cause an oversupply resulting in lower market prices for our products and increased competition, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe availability of and prices for energy will significantly impact our business.\nThe production of our products requires a significant amount of energy and we rely primarily on natural gas and electricity for our energy needs. The prices of these inputs are subject to change based on many factors that are beyond our control, such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation. In particular, natural gas prices are highly volatile. Our average price per MMBTU was $3.69 in 2018 compared to $4.41 in 2017 and $3.92 in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we consumed approximately 720,000 MMBTU of natural gas at a total cost of $2.6 million and approximately 120 million kilowatt hours of electricity at a total cost of $6.5 million. If our energy costs increase, our cost of sales will increase, and our operating results may be materially, adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to pass increased energy costs on to our customers if the market does not allow us to raise the prices of our finished products. If price adjustments significantly trail the increase in energy costs or if we cannot effectively hedge against these costs, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nBeginning in January 2018 and continuing through December 2019, approximately 80% of our natural gas requirements at our Pryor facility are covered by fixed-price contracts as described above in Item 1 - Business, Raw Materials and Energy. The remainder of our requirements at our Pryor facility through December 2019 are expected to be to be covered under a variable rate supply agreement. Additionally, beginning in January 2018 and continuing through September 2019, approximately 70% of our natural gas requirements at our Barnwell facility are covered by fixed-price contracts. The remainder of our requirements at our Barnwell facility through September 2019 are expected to be purchased on the open market.\nFailure to purchase the contracted quantity of natural gas may result in financial exposure.\nAs discussed above in Item 1 - Business, Raw Materials and Energy, natural gas requirements at our Pryor and Barnwell facilities are purchased on the open market. A significant interruption in our parent roll production due to tornado, fire or other natural disaster, adverse market conditions or mechanical failure could reduce our natural gas requirements to a level below that of our contracted amount. If we are unable to purchase the contracted amounts and the market price at that time is less than the contracted price, we would be obligated under the terms of our agreement to reimburse an amount equal to the difference between the contracted amount and the amount actually purchased multiplied by the difference between our contract price and a price designed in the contract, which typically approximates spot price.\nWe depend on our management team to operate the Company and execute our business plan.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management staff, in particular Jeffrey Schoen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Melinda Bartel, our Chief Financial Officer. We have entered into employment arrangements with Jeffrey Schoen and Melinda Bartel, under which their employment is \"at will\" and, subject to certain conditions, may be terminated by either party at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. The loss of either of our executive officers or our inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nLabor interruptions would adversely affect our business.\nAll of our hourly paid employees in Oklahoma are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial & Service Workers International Union. The collective bargaining agreement with Local 13-930, which represents the Pryor paper mill workers, expires in July 2021. The collective bargaining agreement with Local 13-1480, which represents the Pryor converting facility workers, expires in July 2021.\nNegotiations of new collective bargaining agreements may result in significant increases in the cost of labor or could break down and result in a strike or other disruption of our operations. If any of the preceding were to occur, it could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs and/or decreased operating results. In addition, some of our key customers and suppliers are also unionized. Disruption in their labor relations could also have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur manufacturing operations may experience shutdowns due to unforeseen operational problems or maintenance outages, which may cause significant lost production which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe currently manufacture and process the majority of our tissue paper products in Pryor, Oklahoma. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to tornado, fire or any other calamity could damage our capital equipment or supporting infrastructure and materially impair our ability to manufacture and process tissue paper products. Even a short-term disruption in our production output could damage relations with our customers, causing them to reduce or eliminate the amount of finished products they purchase from us. Any such disruption could result in lost sales, increased costs and reduced profits.\nFurthermore, unexpected production disruptions due to any number of circumstances, including shortages of raw materials, disruptions in the availability of transportation, labor disputes and mechanical or process failures, could cause us to shut down our paper mill or our converting operation, or any part thereof.\nIf any part of our facilities is shut down, it may experience a prolonged start-up period, regardless of the reason for the shutdown. Those start-up periods could range from several days to several months, depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors. The shutdown of our facilities for a substantial period of time for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations require substantial capital, and we may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of our cash requirements.\nOur operations require substantial capital. Expansion or replacement of existing facilities or equipment may require substantial capital expenditures. For example, the construction of our new world-class integrated tissue operation in Barnwell, South Carolina, which began converting production during 2016 and mill and de-inking operations in the second half of 2017, cost approximately $165 million. In 2015 in Pryor, we built a new paper machine and installed a new converting line, which cost approximately $39 million. In 2010, we built a new finished goods warehouse and installed a new converting line, which cost approximately $27 million. In 2009 and 2010, under new environmental standards we were required to build a water treatment facility costing approximately $7 million to reduce BOD and TSS from our discharge water. If our capital resources are inadequate to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, this shortfall could have a material adverse effect on our business and liquidity.\nOur business is subject to governmental regulations and any imposition of new regulations or failure to comply with existing regulations could involve significant additional expense.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations impose stringent standards on us regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, use and handling of hazardous materials, use, handling and disposal of waste, and remediation of environmental contamination. Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions. These may include regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installing pollution control equipment or remedial actions, any of which could involve significant expenditures. Future development of such laws and regulations may require capital expenditures to ensure compliance. We may discover currently unknown environmental problems or conditions in relation to our past or present operations, or we may face unforeseen environmental liabilities in the future. These conditions and liabilities may require site remediation or other costs to maintain compliance or correct violations of environmental laws and regulations; or result in governmental or private claims for damage to person, property or the environment, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to strict liability and, under specific circumstances, joint and several liabilities for the investigation and remediation of the contamination of soil, surface and ground water, including contamination caused by other parties, at properties that we own or operate and at properties where we or our predecessors arranged for the disposal of regulated materials.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and, as a result, our business could be harmed and current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in us, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe have completed an evaluation of our internal control systems to allow management to report on our internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the management assessment and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In our report under Section 404, which is included in Item 9A of this report, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nA material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could materially affect our reported financial results and the market price of our stock could significantly decline. Additionally, adverse publicity related to the disclosure of a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal controls could have a negative effect on our reputation, business and stock price. Although management's assessment and auditor's attestation may provide some level of comfort to the investing public, even the best designed and executed systems of internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance against misreported results and the prevention of fraud.\nThe parent roll market is a commodity market and subject to fluctuations in demand and pricing.\nOverall demand for parent rolls can fluctuate due to changes in the demand for converted products and due to new paper machine start-ups. A significant reduction in demand or increase in papermaking capacity can result in an over-supply of parent rolls, which could negatively affect the market price for parent rolls. A significant reduction in parent roll selling prices could reduce our net sales, decrease our profits and cause us to shut down some of our excess papermaking capacity.\nIf we are unable to continue to implement our business strategies, our financial conditions and operating results could be materially affected.\nOur future operating results will depend, in part, on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategies in a cost effective manner. However, our strategies are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to sell the capacity generated from our converting lines.\nWe continue to focus on maximizing the capacity of our eleven converting lines at our Pryor location. Additionally, the two converting lines at our Barnwell facility are believed to have added an additional 30,000 to 32,000 tons of annual capacity. However, we may not be able to sell enough of our products to fully utilize such capacity. If we are unable to generate the business needed to utilize the production capacity at the Barnwell facility fully, our business and projections could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our strategy includes converting and selling more of our parent roll tonnage as converted product. Converted products sell at a higher price per ton than parent rolls and typically carry a higher margin on a tonnage basis. If we are unable to increase our sales of converted product to fully utilize the capacity from our converting lines, it could result in lost opportunity for increased margins and the need to temporarily or permanently curtail the production of one or more of our converting lines.\nA failure or outage in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use numerous technologies to help run our operations, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any cyber security attack that affects our facilities, our systems, our customers and any of our financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a cyber-attack on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have not experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure. However, future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation, as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber-attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.\nAny security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the Company in investigation, remediation, legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches. For example, laws may require notification to regulators, clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. A cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers. Furthermore, a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or cause damage to our reputation.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nWe currently do not plan to pay dividends on our Common Stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our Common Stock appreciates.\nOn February 21, 2011, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend. We paid dividends totaling $0.35, and $1.40 per share in 2017 and 2016, respectively. No dividends were paid in 2018. In the second quarter of 2017, our Board of Directors considered it prudent to suspend the quarterly dividend to preserve financial flexibility and ensure capital is appropriately allocated to advance the success of our business. Additionally, as amended our Credit Agreement restricts our ability to make any dividend or other distribution payment with respect to our equity unless we have achieved a Leverage Ratio of less than 4 to 1 for two consecutive fiscal quarters and no Default or Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended) exists or would exist following such payment. The amount and timing of dividend payments otherwise remains subject to the judgment and approval of the Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be based upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, restrictions under our credit agreements, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors retains the power to modify, suspend or cancel our dividend policy in any manner and at any time as it may in its discretion deem necessary or appropriate. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock. See \u201c-Risks Related to our Chapter 11 Filings-Trading in our securities during the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. It is probable that our common stock will be canceled and that holders of common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\u201d\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions may:\n\u25cf discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of the Company or a change in our management;\n\u25cf adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock; and\n\u25cf limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur future operating results may be below securities analysts' or investors' expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue and income potential depends on maintaining and expanding our production capacity and realizing buyers for our additional production, and we may be unable to generate significant revenues or grow at the rate expected by securities analysts or investors. In addition, our costs may be higher than we, securities analysts or investors expect. Further, if financial leverage and related risks escalate and/or unforeseen cash flow disruptions were to occur, our stock prices could be adversely affected. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations will suffer, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf the market price of our product;\n\u25cf the cost of fiber used in producing paper;\n\u25cf the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting facility;\n\u25cf the cost of energy;\n\u25cf the costs of labor and maintenance;\n\u25cf financial leverage undertaken, inclusive of its impacts upon interest expense and debt service;\n\u25cf capital spending requirements, inclusive of impacts upon depreciation; and\n\u25cf working capital and other cash flow management.\nOur operating results in any particular period may not be a reliable indication of our future performance. In some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock will likely decline.\nOur common stock has low average trading volume, and we expect that the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially.\nThe average daily trading volume of our common stock in 2018 was approximately 385,000 shares. The market price for our common stock is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts' earnings estimates; and\n\u25cf developments in our industry.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the paper products industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Because of the low trading volume, our stock price is subject to greater potential volatility. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Class action securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management resources, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur directors have limited personal liability and rights of indemnification from us for their actions as directors.\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:\n\u25cf any breach of their duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;\n\u25cf acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n\u25cf unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or\n\u25cf any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive officers and other officers and employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nWe entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers, which are broader than the specific indemnification provision under Delaware law. Under these agreements, we are required to indemnify them against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred, in connection with any actual, or any threatened, proceeding if any of them may be made a party because he or she is or was one of our directors or officers.\nIf any litigation or proceeding were pursued against any of our directors, officers, employees or agents where indemnification is required or permitted, we could incur significant legal expenses and be responsible for any resulting settlement or judgment.", "PERMNO": 90791, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "TISUQ"}
