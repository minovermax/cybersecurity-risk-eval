{"cik": "101063", "company": "CHIQUITA BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating and understanding us and our business, you should carefully consider (1) the risks described below, in conjunction with (2) all of the information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in Exhibit 13 and (3) information in our other filings with the SEC, including any future reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which may include additional or updated risk factors. These are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known or which we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations, and even the risks identified below may adversely affect our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to implement changes and transition plans associated with the Merger, including changes to personnel and practices for interacting with customers and vendors, as well as back office functions. We will be required to devote significant management attention, resources and costs to realigning our business practices and operations. For example, in January 2015 we announced that all of our operational departments and remaining corporate services will be transitioned from Charlotte, North Carolina to other locations closer to customers and operations over the next twelve to eighteen months. Total costs are anticipated to be in the range of $25 to $40 million and are primarily related to: employee severance and relocation; the liability associated with the sub-letting or exit of our space in Charlotte; non-cash write-off of leasehold improvements and office equipment of approximately $10 to $12 million; and the repayment of all $3 million of relocation incentives received in connection with our 2012 move to Charlotte. This process may preclude or impede realization of the benefits expected from the Merger, and could adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot be certain that we will not be required to implement further realignment activities, make additions or other changes to our workforce based on other cost reduction measures or changes in the markets and industry in which we compete. In addition, future business conditions and events may impact our ability to continue to realize any benefits of these initiatives.\nThe highly competitive environment in which we operate, as well as consolidation and other changes among our customers, may reduce the pricing and volume of some of our products and may limit our ability to pass on increased costs to our customers.\nWe primarily sell to retailers and wholesalers. Bidding for contracts or arrangements with retailers, particularly chain stores and other large customers, is highly competitive, and the prices or other terms of our contract bids may not be sufficient to retain existing business, maintain current levels of profitability or to obtain new business. Continuing industry consolidation (horizontally and vertically) and other factors have increased the buying leverage of the major grocery retailers in all of our markets, which may put further downward pressure on our pricing and volume and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to direct competition with other industry participants, we are facing new competition from a few major retailers that have begun to purchase a portion of their fruit directly from independent growers, or to contract directly for transportation of tropical fruit products. While these activities are currently a small part of the market, a significantly increased commitment by retailers to manage their own supply chain could change industry dynamics in ways that reduce our revenues and profitability.\nGlobal economic uncertainties continue to affect consumers' purchasing habits and customer financial stability, which may affect sales volume and profitability on some of our products and have other impacts that we cannot fully predict.\nAs a result of continuing global economic uncertainties, price-conscious consumers may replace their purchases of our premium and value-added products with lower-cost alternatives, which could affect the price and volume of some of these products. For example, sales of our bananas in Europe, where they are sold as a premium brand at a premium price, may suffer if consumers shift to \"value\" or unbranded bananas. Similarly, the volume or profitability of our North American salads business may be adversely affected if consumers are reluctant to pay a premium for value-added salads or if they replace purchases of our branded products with lower-priced alternatives.\nIn Europe, the continuing public concerns over sovereign debt and related European financial restructuring efforts, may cause the value of the European currencies, including the euro, to deteriorate, which in turn could adversely impact our euro-denominated sales and working capital. These sovereign debt concerns may contribute to instability in global credit markets, and economic deterioration in Europe could adversely impact demand for our products and product pricing.\nIn addition, the full effect and duration of the current global economic downturn on customers, vendors and other business partners cannot be determined. For example, major customers or vendors may have financial challenges unrelated to Chiquita that could result in a decrease in their business with us, breaches of obligations to us or, in certain cases, cause them to file for bankruptcy protection. Although we exercise prudent oversight of the credit ratings and financial strength of our major business\npartners and seek to diversify our risk from any single business partner, we cannot be sure that there will not be one or more commercial or financial partners that are unable to meet its contractual commitments to us.\nMany of our products are subject to significant price fluctuations, and the planting, harvesting and shipping cycle of certain of our produce products may limit our ability to respond effectively to these fluctuations and other changes in the market.\nIn markets where we do not have fixed price contracts, the selling price received for each type of produce depends on several factors, including the availability and quality of the produce item in the market and the availability and quality of competing types of produce. For example, in European and the Mediterranean markets, bananas and other produce are sold primarily on the basis of weekly price quotes, even for customers with whom we have annual supply agreements. These prices may fluctuate significantly due to supply conditions, seasonal trends, transportation costs, currency exchange rates, competitive dynamics and other factors. Even in markets where we do have fixed price contracts, these factors may cause decreased demand for, or increased price pressure on, our products at certain times.\nFor many produce products, we make decisions about the specific source and quantities to grow or purchase at the beginning of the applicable growing season, which is typically many months before the product will be sold. Likewise, due to the time required for transportation, which can be three weeks for certain parts of Europe, we allocate harvested fruit among our markets well before the fruit is sold. Accordingly, although we make these supply decisions and allocate produce to each market based on our expectations of market conditions, these conditions may change before the produce is sold. Moreover, because of both the long lead times necessary to bring produce products to market and the perishable nature of these products, we generally cannot time our purchase and sale of products to take advantage of market changes or to avoid selling at unfavorable prices. If we are forced to sell produce at lower prices than we expected when we made our acquisition or allocation decisions, we may not be able to achieve our expected profit, or in extreme cases, recover our costs. Although our arrangements with independent banana growers allow us to avoid incurring transportation costs to bring surplus fruit to market by paying a liquidation price, rather than buying our contracted volume of fruit, we are typically unable to recover the other costs we incur in connection with such unsold surplus fruit.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, crop disease, pests and other natural conditions can impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nBananas, lettuce and other produce can be affected by adverse weather conditions, including drought, temperature extremes, hurricanes, windstorms and floods. Floods in particular may affect bananas, which are typically grown in tropical lowland areas. Fresh produce is also vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of agricultural production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. Unfavorable growing conditions caused by these factors can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost. These factors may result in lower sales volume and, in the case of farms we own or manage, increased costs due to expenditures for additional agricultural techniques or agrichemicals, the repair of infrastructure, and the replanting of damaged or destroyed crops. Incremental costs, including transportation, may also be incurred if we need to find alternate short-term supplies of bananas, lettuce or other produce from other growers. Such costs may reduce our ability to profitably meet our supply obligations to our customers, particularly in North America, where our typical fixed-price per box contract structures can make it difficult to recover these higher costs. For example, as a result of flooding which affected some of our owned farms in 2008 and 2009, we incurred approximately $33 million of higher costs, including logistics costs, related to rehabilitating the farms and procuring replacement fruit from other sources (to the extent it was available).\nFrom time to time, we have experienced shipping interruptions, port damage and changes in shipping routes as a result of weather-related disruptions. While we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption, an extended interruption in our ability to ship and distribute our products could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe expect increases in commodity and raw product costs, including purchased fruit, fertilizer, paper, shipping costs and fuel; to the extent that we cannot pass them on to our customers, they could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur fuel-related costs have increased substantially in recent years, and we generally expect these costs to increase in the future. Bunker fuel, in particular, is an important variable component of our transportation costs. While we use fuel surcharges and forward contracts to offset and mitigate the effects of increases in the price of bunker fuel, there is lag time between price increases and increases in the surcharge index; in addition, these strategies will not eliminate all the adverse effects of price increases on our business, particularly over the long-term. In addition, diesel fuel and other transportation costs are significant components of much of the cost of produce that we purchase from growers and distributors. If the price of any of these items increases significantly, we may not be able to pass on those increases to our customers. We also generally expect the prices we pay to purchase produce to increase over time. During 2014, approximately one-third of our bananas were produced by subsidiaries on owned farms and the remainder was purchased from independent growers under short- and long-term fruit supply contracts; all of our lettuce and other produce is purchased from independent growers under short- and long-term contracts. Increased costs for purchased fruit have negatively affected our operating results in the past, and they may adversely affect our operating results in the future. Many external factors may affect the cost and supply of fresh produce, including: wage and other input cost inflation (e.g. paper,\npackaging, fertilizers); market fluctuations; currency fluctuations; changes in governmental regulations, including exit prices for bananas (which are set by the government in several banana exporting countries); agricultural programs; severe and prolonged weather conditions; disease; natural disasters; labor relations (including increased payments to growers in lieu of increases to government exit prices, specifically in Costa Rica); and other factors. Many other commodity food products are experiencing major price increases, which may affect pricing dynamics in the industry in ways that affect us adversely. If the price of the fresh produce that we purchase increases significantly, we may not be able to effectively pass these costs along to our customers and consumers.\nOur ocean shipping needs are provided under a combination of long-term charters with negotiated fixed rates and market rates for ships under short-term charters and transportation contracts. Although short-term ship charter rates and container shipping rates have decreased in recent years, as the global economy recovers, rates may increase in the future because of declining global refrigerated cargo and container capacity or other market conditions. Furthermore, since our shipping configuration may rely more on short-term charters and transportation contracts, we may be more susceptible to these increases in the future than we have in the past. Our shipping operations also depend on port access and efficient loading and unloading of our perishable products. If a port becomes unavailable due to weather, labor stoppages or other reasons, we maintain contingency plans to use alternative ports to serve our customers, however we may not be able to recover any related cost increases from our customers or consumers.\nOur operations and products are regulated in the areas of food safety and protection of human health and the environment.\nOur worldwide operations and products are subject to inspections by environmental, food safety, health and customs authorities and to numerous governmental regulations, including those relating to the use and disposal of agrichemicals, the documentation of food shipments, the traceability of food products, and labeling of our products for consumers, all of which involve compliance costs. Changes in regulations or laws in the past have required, and in the future may require, operational modifications or capital improvements at various locations. For example, the United States has recently enacted a new food safety law, the Food Safety Modernization Act (the \"Act\"). Although we believe that our food safety standards meet those prescribed by the Act, implementing regulations have not yet been finalized and may require us to make changes to our processes and procedures that could require us to incur unanticipated costs. If violations occur, regulators can impose fines, penalties and other sanctions. In some circumstances, we may decide or be required to recall a product if we or regulators believe it poses a potential risk. For example, we had five separate occasions in 2012 where we voluntarily recalled certain lettuce products, as a precaution, although none of the recalls arose from or resulted in any food-borne disease outbreaks. Although we maintain insurance to cover certain recall losses, this insurance does not cover all events and, even when an event is covered, our retention or deductible may be significant. The costs of these modifications and improvements and of any fines, penalties and recalls could be substantial. Although we maintain and continue to invest in high food safety standards, no precaution can completely eliminate food safety risks from fresh produce.\nWe can be adversely affected by actions of regulators or if other events cause consumers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, even if our products are not implicated. As a result, we may also elect or be required to incur additional costs aimed at increasing consumer confidence in the safety of our products.\nWe are subject to the risk of product liability claims.\nThe sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. While we believe we have implemented practices and procedures in our operations to promote high-quality and safe food products, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even as we improve our food safety practices, we cannot be sure that we will not have claims or events that will affect our reputation, and no precaution can completely eliminate food safety risks from food and beverage products.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance in an amount which we believe to be adequate, claims or liabilities of this nature might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others or they might exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. In addition, large retail customers often require us to indemnify them for claims made by consumers who have purchased our products, regardless of whether the claim arises from our handling of the product.\nClaims or other events or rumors relating to the \"Chiquita\" or \"Fresh Express\" brands could significantly affect our business.\nThe success of our business strategy depends on our continued ability to use our trademarks and related brands in order to increase awareness and further develop our products. Consumers and institutions associate the \"Chiquita\" and \"Fresh Express\" trademarks and related brands with high-quality and safe food products, as well as responsible business practices, which are an integral part of our business. If our efforts to protect our trademarks and related brands are not adequate, or if any third party infringes on or violates our intellectual property, either in print, on the Internet or through other media, the value of our trademarks, brands and other intellectual property may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our products and our business. We have licensed the Chiquita brand to several third parties over whom we have limited control, and acts or\nomissions by these third parties can reflect on our products and our business. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all of our licensees, we cannot be certain that these licensees will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation. Furthermore, any events, rumors or negative publicity regarding the quality and safety of our food products or our business practices, even if baseless or as the result of actions of others in our industry, may adversely affect the value of our brand names and the demand for our products.\nLabor issues can increase our costs or disrupt our operations; pressure to increase union representation could adversely affect our operations; and changes in immigration laws could impact the availability of produce purchased from third-party suppliers.\nMost of our employees working in Central America are covered by labor contracts. Contracts covering approximately 9,000 employees are currently being negotiated, and contracts covering approximately 1,000 employees are set to expire in 2015. Under applicable law, employees are required to continue working under the terms of the expired contract. Approximately 2,000 of our Fresh Express employees, all of whom work in the United States, are covered by labor contracts, with the majority set to expire in 2015 or are under negotiation. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully renegotiate our labor contracts on commercially reasonable terms as they expire or that we will be able to pass on any increased labor costs to our customers.\nWe are exposed to the risks of strikes or other labor-related actions in both our owned farms and those of independent growers or service providers supplying us. Labor stoppages and strikes may result in increased costs and, in the case of agricultural production, decreased crop quality. When prolonged strikes or other labor actions occur in agricultural production, growing crops may be significantly damaged or rendered un-harvestable as a result of the disruption of irrigation, disease and pest control and other agricultural practices. In addition, our non-union workforce, particularly in our salads and healthy snacks business in the U.S., has been subject to union organization efforts from time to time, and we could be subject to future unionization efforts. While we respect freedom of association, increased unionization of our workforce could lead to increases in our operating costs and/or constraints on our operating flexibility.\nWe purchase lettuce and other salad ingredients from many third parties that grow these products in the United States. The personnel engaged for harvesting operations typically include significant numbers of immigrants who are authorized to work in the U.S. The availability and number of these workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in U.S. immigration laws. A scarcity of available personnel to harvest agricultural products in the U.S. could increase our costs for those products or could lead to product shortages.\nOur international operations subject us to numerous risks.\nWe have international operations and sales in countries throughout the world, including in Central America, Europe, the Middle East and China. These activities are subject to risks inherent in operating in those countries, including government regulation, political and economic stability, currency restrictions, fluctuations and other restraints, import and export restrictions, burdensome taxes, risks of expropriation, threats to employees, political instability, terrorist activities, including extortion, and risks of U.S. and foreign governmental regulation and action in relation to these operations. Under certain circumstances, we (i) might need to curtail, cease or alter our activities in a particular region or country, (ii) might not be able to establish or expand operations in certain countries, and (iii) might be subject to fines or other penalties. For example, in 2012, increasing international sanctions against Iran made it difficult for importers to obtain U.S. dollars, euros or other suitable currencies in sufficient quantity on a regular basis. Over the course of 2012, our receivable balance with these customers increased, and we established payment plans with each of these customers to reduce their balances. Certain customers have so far been able to find acceptable methods of payment to comply with their payment plans. However, some customers have not, and as a result we recorded a reserve of $9 million in 2012, with an additional $2 million in 2013 as a result of further delinquency and other repayment risk; in 2014, customers continue to pay within agreed terms. If we are able to collect any portion of these receivables, the reserve may be reversed as appropriate. There can be no assurance that we would not be required to establish additional reserves on other customer receivables in the Middle East. Also, in 2010, Iran suspended the issuance of import licenses for bananas; although the importers in Iran to whom we sell had sufficient licenses that our imports into Iran were not affected, this type of import and export control could significantly affect our ability to market bananas in, or export bananas from, certain countries. Our ability to sell our products to certain customers, countries or regions may be affected by U.S. or other applicable laws. For example, various trade sanctions against Iran and Syria require U.S. government authorization for sales there; notwithstanding the broad trade sanctions against these countries, under current U.S. law and licenses issued thereunder, we are authorized to sell food products to specific customers in these countries. We source bananas from the Philippines for sale in the Middle East under a long-term purchase contract with a former joint venture partner that has committed volumes through 2016. We continue to develop other Middle Eastern markets for these bananas to diversify our risk in the region, but we cannot give assurances of our ability to do so.\nAs described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Operations - Banana Segment, included in Exhibit 13, free trade area agreements (\"FTAs\") between the EU and certain Latin American countries were initialed and implemented in 2012 and 2013, that require, among other things, the banana volumes assigned to relevant countries be administered through export licenses. Implementation of an export license system in the 1990's (subsequently\nruled illegal) significantly increased our logistics and other export costs. Because questions remain over how the banana volume and export licensing rules will be applied over time, it is still unclear what, if any, effect the new FTAs will have on our operations.\nIn addition, as a means to increase tax revenue, governments are making transfer price enforcement a top priority by increasing the number of transfer price audits and creating new challenges for taxpayers. There is also increased legislative activity and many governments are introducing transfer pricing rules for the first time, particularly in Latin America. In general, transfer pricing rules are intended to ensure that cross-border sales among related entities are at arms-length to capture taxable profit or loss in each jurisdiction relative to the value added by a company in that jurisdiction. However, transfer pricing rules and application of those rules can vary widely between jurisdictions and can be applied inconsistently. As described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both included in Exhibit 13, Ecuador is challenging the transfer pricing practices of major banana exporters and has assessed $23 million of income taxes, penalties and interest related to transfer pricing from 2008 through 2010. If Ecuador applies a similar methodology for tax years 2011 to present, additional assessments may be made. While we believe appropriate transfer pricing was applied in Ecuador and that it is more-likely-than-not that we will succeed upon appeal of these assessments, the outcome may not be known for a significant period of time and may involve significant costs. Additionally, other Latin American countries such as Costa Rica and Panama are implementing transfer pricing rules. While we believe we have taken appropriate measures to comply with these legislative changes, the actual application of these rules is uncertain and may negatively impact profitability or sourcing options.\nWe may be subject to substantial damage claims or fines arising from current legal proceedings related to our international operations.\nWe are currently involved in legal proceedings and investigations, described in more detail in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Exhibit 13, and under \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\", involving, among other things, (i) litigation and investigations relating to payments made by our former banana-producing subsidiary in Colombia to a paramilitary group in that country which had been designated under U.S. law as a foreign terrorist organization, activities for which we have already paid penalties to the U.S. Department of Justice, and (ii) customs proceedings in Italy. Based on Italian procedural requirements in some of the Italian customs proceedings, we are currently required to make payments on an installment basis as a result of unfavorable rulings that are being appealed. Although these funds will be returned to us with interest if we ultimately prevail on appeal, the level of installment payments could increase significantly if similar unfavorable rulings are received in other cases, and the requirement to pay is not stayed or suspended. Regardless of the outcomes of these matters, we will incur legal and other fees to defend ourselves in all of these proceedings, which in aggregate may have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur international operations involve a variety of currencies, with our most significant exposure being to the euro. Both sales and local selling and transportation costs in our core European markets are in euros and other major European currencies. We also have significant operations in Latin America that result in costs in those local currencies; however, our banana and other produce purchase contracts are typically in U.S. dollars. Because produce purchase contracts are typically denominated in U.S. dollars, and produce in Europe and the Middle East typically is sold on the basis of weekly price quotes, local selling prices fluctuate partially as a result of currency exchange fluctuations. We cannot be sure that we can increase our local pricing to offset any unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations, such as the euro weakening against the U.S. dollar.\nWe reduce currency exchange risk from sales originating in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by exchanging local currencies for dollars promptly upon receipt. We may further reduce our currency exposure for these sales by purchasing hedging instruments to hedge the dollar value of our estimated euro net sales exposure up to 18 months into the future if we believe the cost-benefit is favorable. However, hedging activities cannot eliminate any long-term risk of currency exposure, and while we enter into hedging transactions only with highly-rated financial institutions, we cannot be sure that these institutions will be able to honor their contractual commitments if there were a major disruption in the financial markets.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet; a substantial impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely affect our financial statements.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $522 million of intangible assets, including goodwill of $18 million and trademarks of $39 million related to our salad operations, Fresh Express, and $388 million related to the Chiquita trademark. The value of these intangible assets depend on a variety of factors, including the success of our business, earnings growth and market conditions. Accounting standards require us to review goodwill and trademarks at least annually for impairment, and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Based on the result of lower operating performance of retail value-added salad business, lower retail salad volumes, lower perceived valuation multiples in the packaged salad industry and continuing demand for private label versus branded products, we recorded a 2012 non-cash impairment charge to goodwill at Fresh Express. We cannot be sure that future reviews of our goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets will not result in additional impairment\ncharges. Although it does not affect cash flow or our compliance under our current credit facility, an impairment charge decreases our net income and shareholders' equity.\nOur level of indebtedness and the covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy or to react to changes in our business, and we may be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs.\nWe had $668 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2014. Most of our indebtedness and certain operating leases are issued under debt agreements that (1) require continuing compliance with covenants and (2) limit our ability to borrow additional funds due to limits under these covenants. Our ability to comply with provisions under any of our debt agreements will be affected by our operating results and cash flow, which may be affected by events beyond our control.\nIf there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments and we were unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, or if we had a change of control, the holders of the affected debt, as well as other holders of debt and leases with cross-default provisions, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities, affected leases and other contracts.\nAlthough the amounts are volatile, our operations generated positive cash flow in recent years. If our operating results and cash flow continue to decline for any reason, including those beyond our control, it might: (1) cause a default under our debt agreements; (2) increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; (3) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry; (4) further limit our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments or to introduce related core products; (5) further limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and (6) place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt or greater financial resources.", "PERMNO": 89329, "SIC": 100, "TIC": "CQB"}
