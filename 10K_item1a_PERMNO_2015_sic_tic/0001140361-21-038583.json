RISK FACTORS\nOperational Risks\nEffectively managing change and growth.\nOur future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to effectively manage the anticipated growth and managing customer timelines. We are continuously investing in growth areas and expanding our operations, increasing our headcount and expanding into new product offerings. This growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources, and continued growth presents several challenges, including:\n\u25cf expanding manufacturing capacity, maintaining quality and increasing production;\n\u25cf identifying, attracting and retaining qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf increasing our regulatory compliance capabilities, particularly in new lines of business or product offerings.\nA failure to adequately manage these and other risks related to our growth could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRaw material inflation or shortage of available materials could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRaw materials are subject to price fluctuations and availability, due to external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, weather-related events, or other supply chain challenges, that are beyond our control. Temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials have occurred in fiscal 2021, which has led to increased raw material price volatility and which could continue into fiscal 2022. Additionally, our suppliers could experience cost increases to produce raw material due to increases in carbon pricing. Historically we have been able to manage the impact of higher costs by increasing our selling prices. We have generally been well positioned to capture additional market share as our primarily raw material, polymer resin, is typically a lower cost and more versatile substrate compared to alternatives. However, raw material shortages or our inability to timely pass through increased costs to our customers may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully and our customers may not continue to purchase our products.\nWe compete with multiple companies in each of our product lines on the basis of a number of considerations, including price, service, quality, product characteristics and the ability to supply products to customers in a timely manner. Our products also compete with various other substrates. Some of these competitive products are not subject to the impact of changes in resin prices, which may have a significant and negative impact on our competitive position versus substitute products. Additionally, consumer's view on environmental consideration could potentially impact demand for our products that utilize fossil fuel based materials in their manufacturing. Our competitors may have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be better able than us to withstand higher costs. Competition and product preference changes could result in our products losing market share or our having to reduce our prices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, since we do not have long-term arrangements with many of our customers, these competitive factors could cause our customers to shift suppliers and/or packaging material quickly. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond timely to customer and market changes.\nWe may pursue and execute acquisitions or divestitures, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we consider transactions that either complement or expand our existing business and create economic value. Transactions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies as well as difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or carving-out divested businesses, which may result in substantial costs, delays or other problems that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not realize all of the synergies we expect to achieve from our current strategic initiatives due to a variety of risks. If we are unable to achieve the benefits that we expect to achieve from our strategic initiatives, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event of a catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing facilities, our business would be adversely affected.\nWhile we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, pandemic or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could result in significant losses.\nEmployee retention, labor cost inflation or the failure to renew collective bargaining agreements could disrupt our business.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2021, we employed approximately 47,000 employees with approximately 20% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of these employees expire annually and as a result, are due for renegotiation in fiscal year ending 2022 (\u201cfiscal 2022\u201d). Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years. However, we may not be able to maintain constructive relationships with labor unions or trade councils and may not be able to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms in the future.\nLabor is subject to cost inflation and availability, due to external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates, that are beyond our control. As a result, there can be no assurance we will be able to recruit, train, assimilate, motivate and retain employees in the future. The loss of a substantial number of these employees or a prolonged labor dispute could disrupt our business and result in significant losses.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business, and increased cybersecurity threats, system inadequacies, and failures could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, vendor and other data which could negatively affect our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of information technology systems and networks. These systems and networks are vulnerable to increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated computer crime, energy interruptions, telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions.\nWe also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such information, security breaches, misplaced or lost data and programming damages could result in production downtimes, operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of business opportunities, violation of privacy laws and legal liability, fines, penalties or negative publicity could result in a negative impact on the business. While we have not had material system interruptions historically associated with these risks, there can be no assurance that these advanced and persistent threats will prevent future interruptions that could result in significant losses.\nFinancial and Legal Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could affect our ability to meet our obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, servicing the interest obligations of our existing indebtedness could limit our ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing our business through acquisitions or increased levels of capital expenditures.\nGoodwill and other intangibles represent a significant amount of our net worth, and a future write-off could result in lower reported net income and a reduction of our net worth.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill. Future changes in market multiples, cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other external factors, may adversely affect our business and cause our goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write off goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets for the amount of impairment. If a future write-off is required, the charge could result in significant losses.\nOur international operations pose risks to our business that may not be present with our domestic operations.\nForeign operations are subject to certain risks that are unique to doing business in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, economic or political instability, shipping delays in our products and receiving delays of raw materials, changes in applicable laws, including assessments of income and non-income related taxes, reduced protection of intellectual property, inability to readily repatriate cash to the U.S. effectively, and regulatory policies and various trade restrictions including potential changes to export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duties for exported products from these countries. Any of these risks could disrupt our business and result in significant losses. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. We have implemented safeguards, training and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards, training and policies to assure compliance and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, debarment from export privileges and penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent and future environmental and other governmental requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.\nWhile we have not been required historically to make significant capital expenditures in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict our future capital expenditure requirements because of continually changing compliance standards and environmental technology. Furthermore, violations or contaminated sites that we do not know about (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or newly discovered information) could result in additional compliance or remediation costs or other liabilities, which could be material. In addition, federal, state, local, and foreign governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters, such as greenhouse gas emissions, that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, packaging products. Legislation that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of products would require diversion of solid waste such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced. For example, the European Union (\"EU\") recently introduced a non-recycled polymer resin packaging waste bloc-wide levy. While each member state is evaluating how to fund the levy which ranges from taxing the sector or passing costs down the line to all businesses and end consumers, we believe that any such laws promulgated to date have not had a material adverse effect on us, as we have historically been able to manage the impact of higher costs by increasing our selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulation would not have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws and regulations are complex and the determination of our global provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. We are subject to routine examinations of our income tax returns, and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax. Our future income taxes could also be negatively impacted by our mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate being different than anticipated given differences in statutory tax rates in the countries in which we operate. In addition, tax policy efforts to raise global corporate tax rates could adversely impact our tax rate and subsequent tax expense.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.\nIn addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could result in significant losses.", "PERMNO": 13604, "SIC": 3080, "TIC": "BERY"}
