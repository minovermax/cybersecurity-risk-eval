{"cik": "1005409", "company": "DIME COMMUNITY BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company's business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nThe Company's financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in the New York metropolitan area and in the United States as a whole. Conditions in the marketplace for the Bank's property collateral types (mainly multifamily and commercial real estate) remained stronger than most other parts of the country throughout the years of the financial crisis, and in fact have recently rebounded to healthy pre-crisis levels. Nevertheless, given the precarious nature of financial and economic conditions both nationally and globally, this status is always subject to change, which could adversely affect the credit quality of the Bank's loans, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending may subject it to greater risk of an adverse impact on operations from a decline in the economy.\nThe credit quality of the Bank's portfolio can have a significant impact on the Company's earnings, results of operations and financial condition. As part of the Company\u2019s strategic plan, it originates loans secured by commercial real estate that are generally viewed as exposing lenders to a greater risk of loss than both one- to four-family and multifamily residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent upon successful operation or management of the collateral properties, as well as the success of the business and retail tenants occupying the properties, repayment of such loans are generally more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. Further, the collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, or fluctuate in value based upon the rentability, among other commercial factors.\nThe performance of Bank's multifamily and mixed-use loans could be adversely impacted by regulation or a weakened economy.\nMultifamily and mixed use loans generally involve a greater risk than one- to four- family residential mortgage loans because government regulations such as rent control and rent stabilization laws, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank, could impair the value of the security for the loan or the future cash flow of such properties. As a result, rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.). Impaired loans are thus difficult to identify before they become problematic. In addition, if the cash flow from a collateral property is reduced (e.g., if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan and the value of the security for the loan may be impaired.\nExtensions of credit on multifamily, mixed-use or commercial real estate loans may result from reliance upon inaccurate or misleading information received from the borrower.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit on multifamily, mixed-use or commercial real estate loans, the Bank may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of a customer and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. In the event such information is inaccurate or misleading, reliance on it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business and, in turn, its financial condition and results of operations.\nGeographic and borrower concentrations could adversely impact financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans, as well as the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon business and economic conditions in the United States, particularly in the local New York metropolitan area where the Company conducts substantially all of its business. Conditions in these marketplaces have begun to rebound in recent months after several years of deterioration. Should such conditions fail to continue to improve, they may adversely affect the credit quality of the Bank\u2019s loans, its results of operations and its financial condition.\nConditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for the Bank\u2019s mortgage loans are located strongly influence the level of the Bank\u2019s non-performing loans and the value of its collateral. Real estate values are affected by, among other items, fluctuations in general or local economic conditions, supply and demand, changes in governmental rules or policies, the availability of loans to potential purchasers and acts of nature. Declines in real estate markets have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, at December 31, 2016 the Bank had three borrowers for which its total lending exposure equaled or exceeded 10% of its Tier 1 risk-based capital (its lowest capital measure). Default by these borrowers could adversely impact the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Bank\u2019s ability to grow its portfolio of multifamily and commercial real estate loans were limited due to regulatory concerns about its concentrated position in such assets, its ability to generate interest income could be adversely affected, as would its financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nThe Bank\u2019s portfolios of multifamily and commercial real estate loans represent the largest portion of its asset mix (approximately 98.6% of all loans as of December 31, 2016). The Bank\u2019s position in these markets has been instrumental to its production of solid earnings and its consistent record of exceptional asset quality. In view of the heightened regulatory focus on commercial real estate concentration, it is possible that the regulators may seek to restrict the Bank\u2019s growth in those asset classes. Were the Bank to be so limited, its net interest income and its earnings capacity would likely be adversely impacted.\nGrowth of the C&I Portfolio could result in higher provisions for loan losses, thus reducing earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity\nThe Bank\u2019s strategic plan to grow the C&I loan portfolio could result in higher provisions for loan losses as the portfolio is seasoned over time. The addition of new loan products will require more qualitative analysis in determining the appropriate level of loan loss provisions.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may be insufficient.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in its loan portfolio. The amount of inherent loan losses which could be ultimately realized is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that could be beyond the Bank\u2019s control. Such losses could exceed current estimates. Although management believes that the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses is adequate, there can be no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to satisfy actual loan losses should such losses be realized. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Bank\u2019s primary source of income is its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities. The Bank's one-year interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within one year and its interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within one year, expressed as both a total amount and as a percentage of total assets. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's one year interest rate gap was negative 22%, indicating that the overall level of its interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded that of its interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within one year. In a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in its cost of liabilities relative to its yield on assets, and thus a decline in net interest income from its existing investments and funding sources.\nBased upon historical experience, if interest rates were to rise, the Bank would expect the demand for multifamily loans to decline. Decreased loan origination volume would likely negatively impact the Bank's interest income. In addition, if interest rates were to rise rapidly and result in an economic decline, the Bank would expect its level of non-performing loans to increase. Such an increase in non-performing loans may result in an increase to the provision/allowance for loan losses and possible increased charge-offs, which would negatively impact the Company's net income.\nFurther, the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and MBS are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage redemption rates and market interest rates. Mortgage prepayment, satisfaction and refinancing rates will vary due to several factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, and other demographic variables. However, the most significant factors affecting prepayment, satisfaction and refinancing rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. The level of mortgage and MBS prepayment, satisfaction and refinancing activity impacts the Company's earnings due to its effect on fee income earned on prepayment and refinancing activities, along with liquidity levels the Company will experience to fund new investments or ongoing operations.\nAs a New York State chartered savings bank, the Bank is required to monitor changes in its Economic Value of Equity (\"EVE\"), which is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the Bank\u2019s assets and liabilities plus the value of any off-balance sheet items, such as firm commitments to originate loans, or derivatives, if applicable. To monitor its overall sensitivity to changes in interest rates, the Bank also simulates the effect of instantaneous changes in interest rates of up to 400 basis points on its assets, liabilities and net interest income. Interest rates do and will continue to fluctuate, and the Bank cannot predict future FOMC actions or other factors that will cause interest rates to vary.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to uncertain risks related to changes in laws, government regulation and monetary policy.\nThe Holding Company and the Bank are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the NYSDFS (the Bank's primary regulator), the FRB (the Holding Company's primary regulator) and the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. Such regulation limits the manner in which the Holding Company and Bank conduct business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulation is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and the Bank\u2019s depositors, and not to benefit shareholders or creditors. The regulatory structure also provides the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Holding Company and Bank to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Holding Company and Bank. For further information regarding the laws and regulations that affect the Holding Company and the Bank, see \"Item 1. Business - Regulation - Regulation of New York State Chartered Savings Banks,\" and \"Item 1. Business - Regulation - Regulation of Holding Company.\"\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in significant part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the Company's net interest margin. Government action can materially decrease the value of the Company's financial assets, such as debt securities, mortgages and MSR. Governmental policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB or governmental policies are beyond the Company's control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on the Company's activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nThe federal government may make changes in tax legislation that would lower the federal corporate income tax rate from the current level of 35%. These changes could result in an impairment of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets as future tax benefit deferrals would be measured at a lower tax rate. Any impairment identified would be recorded through the Company\u2019s earnings and recognized in the quarter in which the lower rate is enacted. The Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2016 was $22.3 million. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of deferred tax assets.\nFinancial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years, and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within the control of the Holding Company or the Bank. In addition, recent political developments, including the change in administration in the United States, have added uncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms, including those relating to implementation of the Reform Act. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws may cause the Company's results of operations to differ materially. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for the Company, primarily through open market operations in United States government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements for liquid assets. A material change in any of these conditions would have a material impact on the Bank, and therefore, on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nCompetition from other financial institutions in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect profitability.\nThe Bank operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, and continued consolidation.\nThe Bank's retail banking and a significant portion of its lending business are concentrated in the NYC metropolitan area. The NYC banking environment is extremely competitive. The Bank\u2019s competition for loans exists principally from savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage banks and insurance companies. The Bank has faced sustained competition for the origination of multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans. Management anticipates that the current level of competition for multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans will continue for the foreseeable future, and this competition may inhibit the Bank\u2019s ability to maintain its current level and pricing of such loans.\nClients could pursue alternatives to the Bank's deposits, causing the Bank to lose a historically less expensive source of funding. The Bank gathers deposits in direct competition with commercial banks, savings banks and brokerage firms, many among the largest in the nation. In addition, it must also compete for deposit monies against the stock markets, mutual funds, and other securities. Over the previous decade, consolidation in the financial services industry, coupled with the emergence of Internet banking, has altered the deposit gathering landscape and may increase competitive pressures on the Bank.\nThe Bank may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of its depositors and borrowers or meet its operating cash needs.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors. The Holding Company's overall liquidity position and the liquidity position of the Bank are regularly monitored to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Funding sources include deposits, repayments of loans and MBS, investment security maturities and redemptions, and advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. The Bank also can borrow through the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s discount window. If the Bank was unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, it might be unable to meet customers\u2019 needs, which could adversely impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory capital.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company's reputation and adversely impact its business and revenues.\nAs a financial institution, the Bank's earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion could result from the Company's actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by the Bank to meet customers\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and/or retain clients and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by one of the Company's businesses can result in negative public opinion about its other businesses. Negative public opinion could also affect the Company's credit ratings, which are important to its access to unsecured wholesale borrowings. Significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources of funding.\nThe recent adoption of regulatory reform legislation has created uncertainty and may have a material effect on the Company's operations and capital requirements.\nThe Reform Act creates minimum standards for the origination of mortgage loans. The CFPB has adopted rules imposing extensive regulations governing an institution\u2019s obligation to evaluate a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage loan. The rule applies to all consumer mortgages (except home equity lines of credit, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages or temporary loans). The rule also prohibits prepayment fees on certain types of mortgage loans.\nCongress and various federal regulators also may significantly impact the financial services industry and the Company's business. Complying with any new legislative or regulatory requirements could have an adverse impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, its ability to fill positions with the most qualified candidates available, and the Holding Company's ability to maintain its dividend. Further, while the change in administration in the United States may ultimately roll back or modify certain of the regulatory reforms adopted since the financial crises, uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime, may negatively impact the Company\u2019s businesses, at least in the short term.\nFurthermore, the Federal Government may take action to transform the role of government in the U.S. housing market, such as reducing the size and scope of FNMA and FHLMC, or diminishing other government support to such markets. Congressional leaders have voiced similar plans for future legislation. It is too early to determine the nature and scope of any legislation that may develop along these lines, or the roles FNMA and FHLMC or the private sector will play in future housing markets. However, it is possible that legislation will be proposed over the near term that would considerably limit the nature of GSE guarantees relative to historical measurements, which could have broad adverse implications for the market and significant implications for the Company's business.\nThe Bank has recently become subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the federal banking agencies have adopted the Basel III Capital Rules, which apply to both the Bank and Holding Company. These rules are subject to phase-in periods until January 1, 2019 for certain of their components. The Basel III Capital Rules will result in significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios for the Bank than those previously in effect. The Basel III Capital Rules will also apply to the Holding Company, which, as a savings and loan holding company, was not previously subject to consolidated risk-based capital requirements.\nWhile the Bank expects to satisfy the requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules, inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, as phased in by the FRB, it may fail to do so. In addition, these requirements could have a negative impact on the Bank\u2019s ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions and make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower the Company\u2019s consolidated return on equity.\nThe Company's accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate its probable incurred loan losses and to measure the fair value of some financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models the Company uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models the Company uses for determining its probable incurred loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the model the Company uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments is inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of the Company\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had $55.6 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the Common Stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, the Company would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nThe Company's internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are satisfied. Any failure or circumvention of the Company's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's risk management practices may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which it is subject or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is subject to a number of risks, including credit, interest rate, liquidity, market, operational, legal/compliance, reputational, and strategic. The Company's risk management framework is designed to minimize the risks to which it is subject, as well as any losses resulting from such risks. Although the Company seeks to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control the Company's exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated.\nFor example, recent economic conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, and increases in the overall complexity of the Company's operations, among other developments, have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated, highlighting the intrinsic limitations of the Company's risk monitoring and mitigation techniques. As a result, the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in the Company incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's operations rely on certain external vendors.\nThe Company relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus, or for any other reason, could be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit risk stemming from held-for-investment lending activities may adversely impact on the Company's consolidated net income.\nThe loans originated by the Bank for investment are primarily multifamily residential loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans. Such loans are generally larger, and have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities, than one-to four-family mortgage loans. Credit risk would ordinarily be expected to increase with the growth of these loan portfolios.\nPayments on multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans generally depend on the income produced by the underlying properties, which, in turn, depend on their successful operation and management. Accordingly, the ability of the Bank's borrowers to repay these loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the local real estate market and the local economy. While the Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which generally require that such loans be qualified on the basis of the collateral property\u2019s cash flows, appraised value, and debt service coverage ratio, among other factors, there can be no assurance that the Bank's underwriting policies will protect it from credit-related losses or delinquencies.\nAlthough the Bank's losses have been comparatively limited, despite the economic weakness in its market, it cannot guarantee that this record will be maintained in future periods. The ability of the Bank's borrowers to repay their loans could be adversely impacted by a further decline in real estate values and/or an increase in unemployment, which not only could result in an increase in charge-offs and/or the provision for loan losses. Either of these events would have an adverse impact on the Company's consolidated net income.\nSecurity measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of the Company's business, as it uses such systems to manage its customer relationships, general ledger, deposits, and loans. The Company's operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although the Company takes protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of its computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact.\nIn addition, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to the Company's confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of its customers, clients, or counterparties. If one or more of such events were to occur, the confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, the Company's computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized, or the operations of the Company or its customers, clients, or counterparties could otherwise experience interruptions or malfunctions. This could cause the Company significant reputational damage or result in significant losses.\nFurthermore, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Also, the Company may be subject to wholly or partially uninsured litigation and financial losses.\nIn addition, the Company routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential, and proprietary information by e-mail and other electronic means. The Company has discussed and worked with its appropriate customers and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities, however, it does not have, and may be unable to install, secure capabilities with all of these constituents, and may be unable to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. Any interception, misuse, or mishandling of personal, confidential, or proprietary information transmitted to or received from a customer or counterparty could result in legal liability, regulatory action, and reputational harm, and could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's competitive position, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSecurity measures may not protect the Company from systems failures or interruptions.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of the Company's business, as it uses such systems to manage its customer relationships, general ledger, deposits, and loans. The Company's operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. The security of its computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact.\nA failure in or breach of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to the Company's confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of its customers, clients, or counterparties. If one or more of such events were to occur, the confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, the Company's computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized, or the operations of the Company or its customers, clients, or counterparties could otherwise experience interruptions or malfunctions. If this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, the Company could additionally be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of popular financial entities.\nFurthermore, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Also, the Company may be subject to wholly or partially uninsured litigation and financial losses.\nIn addition, the Company routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential, and proprietary information by e-mail and other electronic means. The Company has discussed and worked with its appropriate customers and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities, however, it does not have, and may be unable to install, secure capabilities with all of these constituents, and may be unable to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. Any interception, misuse, or mishandling of personal, confidential, or proprietary information transmitted to or received from a customer or counterparty could result in legal liability, regulatory action, and reputational harm, and could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's competitive position, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company also outsources certain aspects of its data processing to select third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or problems arise in communicating with them, the Company's ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and its business operations could be adversely impacted.\nAlthough both the Company and all significant third party providers utilized to process, store and transmit confidential and other information employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of the information did occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed.\nThe trading volume in the Common Stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough the Common Stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Exchange, the trading volume in its Common Stock is less than that of other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Common Stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Holding Company has no control. Given the lower trading volume of the Common Stock, significant sales of the Common Stock, or the expectation of these sales, could, from time to time, cause the Holding Company's stock price to exhibit weakness unrelated to financial performance.\nThe Holding Company may reduce or eliminate dividends on its Common Stock in the future.\nHolders of the Common Stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although the Holding Company has historically declared cash dividends on its Common Stock, it is not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate its Common Stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. In addition, the Holding Company is a savings and loan holding company, and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends.", "PERMNO": 83815, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "DCOM"}
