{"cik": "21535", "company": "COHU INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Xcerra acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nCohu acquired Xcerra on October 1, 2018, at which time Xcerra became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (the \u201cMerger\u201d). Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger depends, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully integrate Xcerra, which has been and continues to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively or delayed, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits, and could ultimately be unsuccessful. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger in the time frame we initially anticipated could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the integration of Xcerra may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of employees, customers, suppliers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges and risks include:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties entering new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u25cf\nsuch a new market for Cohu, the automated test equipment market, is intensely competitive with entrenched large competitors who are much larger than Cohu;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully managing relationships with Cohu and Xcerra\u2019s combined supplier and customer base;\n\u25cf\ncoordinating and integrating independent research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs;\n\u25cf\ncoordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company\u2019s capabilities and the direction of product development;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and potential loss of sales in transitioning customers from certain Xcerra products that are being discontinued and to Cohu products;\n\u25cf\nproduct manufacturing disruptions and delays as we consolidate certain manufacturing sites;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and errors that may occur in integrating disparate accounting staffs, processes and systems;\n\u25cf\nthe increased scale and complexity of Cohu\u2019s operations resulting from the Merger;\n\u25cf\nCohu\u2019s ability to achieve the targeted cost synergies within the expected time frame, and significant costs of integration and restructuring;\n\u25cf\nretaining key employees of Cohu and Xcerra;\n\u25cf\nobligations that Cohu will have to counterparties of Xcerra that arise as a result of the change in control of Xcerra;\n\u25cf\nlegal impediments, delays and significant costs to reduce headcounts in various geographies;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of litigation and potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Xcerra; and\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Cohu incurred $16.2 million of restructuring charges for the Xcerra acquisition during fiscal year 2019 and additional restructuring charges or unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.\nWe may underperform relative to our expectations.\nOur business and financial performance, especially with our acquisition of Xcerra, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Xcerra have achieved or might achieve separately and, in fact, due to weak market conditions in 2019 sales and earnings related to the Xcerra related business declined significantly on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we believe Xcerra\u2019s ATE products have been materially impacted by the Huawei export restrictions and may adversely affect our revenues and operating results in the near term (see risk factor entitled \u201cGlobal economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition\u201d). Any further underperformance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainties underlie Cohu\u2019s expectation that, relative to Cohu on a stand-alone basis, the Merger will be accretive to Cohu\u2019s earnings per share.\nCohu currently believes that, relative to Cohu on a stand-alone basis, the Merger will be accretive to Cohu\u2019s earnings per share upon completion of the ongoing restructuring and integration and after the recovery of market conditions. However, Cohu cannot give any assurance that the Merger will actually be accretive to Cohu\u2019s earnings per share.\nThe use of cash and incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the Merger may have an adverse impact on Cohu\u2019s liquidity, limit Cohu\u2019s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu\u2019s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe Merger was financed in part by using Cohu\u2019s and Xcerra\u2019s cash on hand and the incurrence of indebtedness. In connection with the Merger, Cohu entered into a term loan facility, with an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the \u201cDebt Financing\u201d or \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Cohu used $160.5 million of Cohu\u2019s and Xcerra\u2019s cash on hand to complete the Merger. After completing the Merger and paying acquisition-related costs, Cohu\u2019s (including Xcerra\u2019s) cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 29, 2018, were approximately $165.0 million. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 28, 2019, were approximately $156.1 million. The use of cash on hand and indebtedness to finance the acquisition has reduced Cohu\u2019s liquidity and could cause Cohu to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on Cohu\u2019s debt, thereby reducing the availability of Cohu\u2019s cash flow for working capital, dividend and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various representations and negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u25cf\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u25cf\npay cash dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock;\n\u25cf\nenter into rate, commodity, equity or currency swap, hedging or other similar transactions;\n\u25cf\nmake loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to create liens, or that require the grant of a lien to secure an obligation if a lien is granted to secure another obligation;\n\u25cf\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nsell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets; and\n\u25cf\ndissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another person.\nThe restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u25cf\nfinance our operations;\n\u25cf\nmake needed capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\n\u25cf\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u25cf\nengage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u25cf\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nA breach of any of these negative covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Further, additional indebtedness that we incur in the future may subject us to further covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. The lender may accelerate the payment terms of the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events of default set forth therein, which include: the failure of Cohu to make timely payments of amounts due under the Credit Agreement, the failure of Cohu to adhere to the representations and covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, the failure to provide notice of any event that causes a material adverse effect or to provide other required notices, upon the event that related collateral agreements become ineffective, upon the event that certain legal judgments are entered against Cohu, the insolvency of Cohu, or upon the change of control of Cohu. Any event that could require us to repay debt prior to its due date could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with covenants contained in such debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, on a first-priority basis, and such security interests could be enforced in the event of default by the collateral agent for the Credit Agreement.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nInterest rates under our Credit Agreement are calculated using LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, a comparable or successor reference rate must be negotiated and agreed among the Administrative Agent, the Company and certain lenders under the Credit Agreement. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nCohu has total consolidated long-term debt of $347 million and because of such high debt levels we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense.\nCohu\u2019s ability to meet its expense and debt service obligations contained in the Debt Financing agreements will depend on Cohu\u2019s future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in industry conditions, industry supply and demand balance, customer preferences, the success of Cohu\u2019s products, pressure from competitors, and Cohu\u2019s ability to successfully integrate Xcerra in a timely manner. In addition, Cohu is subject to interest rate risks, and continuing increases in interest rates will increase Cohu\u2019s debt service obligations. Should combined Cohu and Xcerra revenues decline after the Merger (on a year-over-year basis), as they did in fiscal year 2019, Cohu may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due. If Cohu is unable to meet its debt service obligations after the Merger or should Cohu fail to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing its indebtedness, Cohu may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue Cohu Common Stock or other equity securities. Cohu may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to Cohu, in amounts sufficient to meet Cohu\u2019s needs or at all. If Cohu is able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities, such issuance would also result in dilution to Cohu\u2019s stockholders. Cohu\u2019s inability to service its debt obligations or refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results after the Merger. In addition, Cohu\u2019s debt obligations may limit its ability to make required investments in capacity, technology or other areas of its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits the deductibility of interest expense in a given year to 30% of adjusted taxable income, as defined. This resulted in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of its interest expense deductions in 2018 and 2019 and may impact our ability to utilize future deductions. However, the Act permits indefinite carryforward of any disallowed business interest, subject to Internal Revenue Code section 382 limitations on utilization.\nBecause a significant portion of Cohu\u2019s total assets are represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCohu has accounted for the acquisition of Xcerra using the purchase method of accounting. A portion of the purchase price for this business was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of consummation of the merger. As a result of the Merger, 47.7% of Cohu\u2019s total assets is comprised of goodwill and other intangibles, of which approximately $238.7 million is allocated to goodwill. In accordance with the ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Significant declines in the price of Cohu\u2019s common stock, as we saw in third fiscal quarter 2019, could increase the risk of an impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangibles each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, when Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. Once adjusted, there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nWe are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls.\nCompleting the Merger has significantly increased the size, number of employees, global operations and complexity of Cohu\u2019s business. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nCohu has discovered and may discover additional liabilities or deficiencies associated with Xcerra that were not identified in advance.\nWe may discover liabilities, product return issues or deficiencies associated with Xcerra that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs, including potential accounting and tax charges. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are ultimately dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by Xcerra, as well as the limited amount of time in which the acquisition was executed. For example, since closing the Merger, we have incurred material product returns and associated expenses and were required to make material customer pricing concessions in order to resolve various Xcerra product issues. Any further unexpected liabilities, product return issues or deficiencies associated with Xcerra could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCohu cannot provide assurance that it will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate or at all.\nCohu stockholders may not receive the same or any dividends in the future for various reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf\nas a result of the Merger and the issuance of shares of Cohu Common Stock in connection with the Merger, the total amount of cash required for Cohu to pay dividends at its current rate has increased;\n\u25cf\nCohu\u2019s credit agreement restricts payments of dividends under certain circumstances;\n\u25cf\nCohu may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to Cohu\u2019s operational cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;\n\u25cf\nrising interest rates, which increase Cohu\u2019s debt service obligations;\n\u25cf\nCohu may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve its credit ratings;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\ngiven weak market conditions that began in late 2018 and continued throughout 2019, and the associated business uncertainty, we may determine to take action to preserve cash;\n\u25cf\nCohu may reduce or eliminate its dividend in order to pay down debt;\n\u25cf\ndecisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the Cohu Board, which reserves the right to change Cohu\u2019s dividend practices at any time with no prior notice; and\n\u25cf\nthe amount of dividends that Cohu\u2019s subsidiaries may distribute to Cohu may be subject to restrictions imposed by state or foreign law, restrictions that may be imposed by state or foreign regulators, and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.\nWe are exposed to other risks associated with other acquisitions, investments and divestitures.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;\n\u25cf\nthe cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other operational matters;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nlack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;\n\u25cf\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nfailure to commercialize purchased technology;\n\u25cf\nthe impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and\n\u25cf\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.\nWe may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity-linked (such as convertible debt) or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which would likely affect the market price of our stock. For example, the Merger resulted in significant dilution wherein it was financed in part by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to shareholders of Xcerra, comprised approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after completing the Merger.\nMergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At December 28, 2019, we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $238.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively.\nFurther, as a strategy to pay down long-term debt, we expect to continue to evaluate and pursue divestitures of assets that management determines to be non-core to our overall business strategy. Any such divestitures may distract Cohu\u2019s management team, disrupt employees, may not yield attractive valuations, may incur material restructuring and transaction expenses and tax obligations, and may otherwise be unsuccessful.\nWe are making investments in new products to enter new markets, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be successful.\nGiven the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace. We are currently significantly investing in new product development programs to enable us to compete in the test contactor markets, while also investing in next generation test handlers and automated test equipment. For example, in fiscal year 2019, we incurred $86.1 million in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to make investments and we may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results. There can be no assurance that new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\nWe are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products, support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:\n\u25cf\ncosts and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf\nlegislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in or interpretations of requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;\n\u25cf\ntrade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations;\n\u25cf\ncomplex labor laws and privacy regulations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\nhealth epidemics;\n\u25cf\nlocal political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical instability;\n\u25cf\ncomplex tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of \u201cdouble taxation;\u201d and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs.\nTo highlight the complexity of foreign labor laws, in 2019, we incurred $9.5 million of severance and related costs to downsize and reduce headcount by approximately 105 employees in our Rosenheim, Germany facility, and we would incur material amounts of additional severance costs in the future should we determine to undertake other headcount reduction activities in foreign locations. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe continue to monitor global privacy laws and legislation to determine its impact on our business. We do not sell to consumers nor process individual credit card information, but do maintain certain personally identifiable information on our employees. Such employee information may be subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the recently effective California Consumer Protection Act. We believe that we have implemented reasonable procedures and internal controls in compliance with these laws, but should such actions be insufficient, we may be subject to regulatory investigations, fines and legal costs.\nWe have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.\nOur reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management. Our overseas sites are more susceptible to impacts from natural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical instability (see risk factor entitled \u201cThe occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales\u201d). If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.\nOur suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition.\nFailure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.\nWe use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (\u201csole source\u201d) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable.\nVisibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry\u2019s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $4.1 million, $1.4 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. In the second half of 2018 and throughout 2019, we saw significantly weakened demand in automotive, mobility and consumer market segments, and overall geographic weakness in China and Taiwan. These trends adversely affected our second half 2018 results and full year 2019 results. Such adverse trends have materially impacted all of our business areas, including the businesses conducted by Xcerra. Finally, in 2019 and 2018 we incurred $2.7 million and $19.1 million, respectively, of inventory charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra\u2019s semiconductor test handler products, and these charges may be insufficient as market conditions and demand changes.\nDue to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.\nOur business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. Further, under our Credit Agreement, we are significantly limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. At any time in the future, we may determine to issue new equity-linked (such as convertible debt) or equity securities in order to pay down long-term debt or for other corporate purposes. In such case, existing stockholders may be diluted which would likely affect the market price of our stock. Any such new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive.\nThe semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive, and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.\nWe have increased investments in our test contactor business and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years, but due to weak market conditions we did not achieve our growth goals in 2019. The test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition, with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu entered the automated test equipment (\u201cATE\u201d) market. Our ability to increase our ATE sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor\u2019s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Further, Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, and this market is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. In fact, as market conditions have weakened, we have seen a material reduction in sales within our ATE business. These developments may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.\nSemiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.\nSemiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2019. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers\u2019 equipment and the customers\u2019 manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry\u2019s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, ATE, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry\u2019s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.\nThe seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure.\nThe semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products. These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors. A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations, and such changes in demand (up or down) are difficult to predict and proactively plan for. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers\u2019 changing requirements. Any inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. For example, in the second half of 2018 and throughout 2019, we saw significantly weakened demand in automotive, mobility and consumer market segments, and overall geographic weakness in China and Taiwan. These trends adversely affected our second half 2018 results and full year 2019 results.\nGlobal economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nOur operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.\nIn addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. Possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, which could be imposed by Asia, the United States, other countries or the European Union might also have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery.\nGlobal economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition.\nIn fiscal year 2019, 88% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. We also purchase a significant portion of components and subassemblies from suppliers outside the United States. Additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the United States, including Malaysia, Germany, China and Japan.\nThe United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. General trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating since 2018, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. Higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or repeatedly threatened by U.S. and Chinese leaders. Additionally, the U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from other countries, which could also impact our or certain of our customers' operations. If the U.S. were to impose current or additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source, our cost for such components would increase. We may also incur increases in manufacturing costs and supply chain risks due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations. Tariffs on our customers' products could also impact their sales of such end products, resulting in lower demand for our products.\nWe cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary components and subassemblies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFurthermore, on May 16, 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei to the BIS\u2019s Entity List, which imposes limitations on the supply of certain U.S. items and product support to Huawei. Although our sales to Huawei are immaterial, to ensure compliance with the Entity List restrictions, we suspended shipments of all products to Huawei, effective May 16, 2019. We then reviewed our product portfolio to determine whether our products and related support are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), and therefore within the scope of the Entity List restrictions. We have determined that certain products Huawei purchases from us are not subject to the EAR and consequently can be lawfully sold and shipped to Huawei. Accordingly, we have recently resumed shipping certain products to Huawei.\nWhile Huawei remains on the Entity List, and in the absence of a license from the BIS, we may be unable to work with Huawei on future product development, which may have a negative effect on our ability to sell products to Huawei in the future. Entity List restrictions may also encourage Huawei to seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to Huawei. More broadly, other China-based companies, unrelated to Huawei, may also seek alternative non-U.S. product sources driven by the ongoing unpredictability of U.S.-China trade relations.\nWe believe that the Entity List trade restrictions enacted during second quarter 2019 had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business in that most of our customers\u2019 businesses were disrupted as semiconductor companies evaluated the trade restrictions. We are not aware of any relief from these export restrictions in the U.S.-China \u201cphase 1\u201d trade deal signed on January 15, 2020, and continue to be unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to Huawei or the long-term effects on our business. Additionally, other companies may be added to the Entity List and/or subject to trade restrictions. Further, there will likely continue to be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify, including that some of our other customers\u2019 products which utilize our solutions may also be impacted by these and other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S., China, or other countries. Restrictions on our ability (or our customers\u2019 ability) to sell and ship products to Huawei have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nA limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.\nA small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers\u2019 business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers\u2019 products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.\nIf we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.\nThe process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur global Enterprise Resource Management (\u201cERP\u201d) upgrade may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe are in final development stages of a phased global replacement of our existing ERP solution and have launched the first phase of such new ERP solution in first quarter 2020. The second phase and rollout is planned throughout 2020. The new solution is being developed as an enterprise solution in partnership with a leading provider of ERP tools. Additional investments in enterprise tools that focus on product life-cycle management, our customer experience, and supply chain management are in process to support our growing business. These implementations are extremely complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on software and implementation activities. If we do not effectively implement the system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could result in the loss or corruption of data, delayed order processing and shipments and increased costs. It could also adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports and process transactions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The company has been impacted by immaterial \u201cphishing\u201d schemes and is continuing its efforts to train employees on such risks but may still incur damages from such schemes in the future. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Further, any attack that disrupted our IT systems could impact our sales, financial results and stock price. In response to these risks, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.\nCertain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego and Bay Area, California, Boston, Massachusetts, Rosenheim and Kolbermoor, Germany, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.\nThird parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time-to-time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are also subject to the theft and misappropriation of intellectual property by others, including incidents relating to former employees. We believe we are taking reasonable actions to protect and improve our security, through strengthened IT infrastructure and internal controls, but if these actions are not successful our business could be adversely affected.\nA majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian test handling equipment suppliers.\nThe majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (U.S.) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. Our German subsidiaries income tax returns for 2012 to 2016 are currently under routine examination by tax authorities in Germany. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain, and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu\u2019s ownership. As a result of the acquisition of Xcerra, a greater than 50% cumulative ownership change in Xcerra triggered a significant limitation in the utilization of their net operating loss and research credit carryforwards. Cohu\u2019s ability to use the acquired Xcerra U.S. net operating loss and credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations as defined in sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States. The changes in the Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many provisions, the Tax Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest and certain other corporate deductions, moved from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation that generally allows deferral of U.S. tax on foreign earnings until repatriated to a \u201cterritorial\u201d/dividend exemption system with a minimum tax that will subject foreign earnings to U.S. tax when earned and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, respectively. In accordance with applicable SEC guidance (SAB 118), we recorded provisional amounts as of December 30, 2017, however, these provisional amounts were subject to change in 2018, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the Tax Act. During 2018 we completed the accounting for the effects of the Tax Act and recorded an increase in our transition tax liability of approximately $5.1 million that was fully offset by the use of net operating loss carryforwards resulting in no net increase in tax expense. We must continue to address new regulations and interpretations of the Tax Act as they are issued.\nCompliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.\nCertain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.\nIn addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.\nThere may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States.\nThe change in administration in the United States has resulted and may continue to result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to international trade policy, such as approvals by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; increased duties, tariffs or other restrictions; public company reporting requirements; environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, volcanic eruptions, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, particularly in Asia where approximately 58% of our employees reside, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers and their contract manufacturers. Any disruption of our suppliers or customers and their contract manufacturers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers\u2019 products and likely impact our operating results. Our COVID-19 response measures have already disrupted business travel, customer visits and various company events. Should COVID-19 continue to spread, we would expect an adverse impact on our business, but we are unable to size or forecast the magnitude of any such impact at this time.\nOur financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts\u2019 estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;\n\u25cf timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;\n\u25cf customer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries;\n\u25cf inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;\n\u25cf inventory writedowns;\n\u25cf unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;\n\u25cf inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and\n\u25cf intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.\nDue to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.\nIn addition, as a result of the Credit Facility, we maintain credit ratings with Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) and S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d). The current Moody\u2019s and S&P issuer credit ratings for Cohu are B2 and B, respectively. Moody\u2019s and S&P downgraded their outlook on Cohu from B1 (to B2) and BB- (to B) on September 19, 2019 and October 16, 2019, respectively. The changes in outlook were primarily the result of Cohu's high leverage following a significant decline in operating performance year-to-date in fiscal 2019, weakness in the semiconductor industry, particularly in Cohu's mobility and automotive segments, depressed customer capital spending, and assumptions regarding Cohu\u2019s 2019 cash consumption.\nAny further downgrade of Cohu\u2019s credit ratings or rating outlooks may materially and adversely affect the market price of our equity and the availability, cost or interest rate of other credit or financing. This could make it significantly more costly for Cohu or its subsidiaries to borrow money or enter into new credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings. Any such negative credit rating actions and the reasons for such actions could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on, our debt.\nWe have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.\nA variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 28, 2019, the price of our common stock has ranged from $27.83 to $11.37. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limited backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.", "PERMNO": 30648, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "COHU"}
