RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. An investor should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common stock. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline or we may be forced to cease operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is subject to rapid scientific change, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market for genetic and molecular testing services is characterized by rapid scientific developments, evolving industry standards and customer demands, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. For example, new tests developed by our competitors may prove superior and replace our existing tests. Additionally, certain technological changes such as advances in point-of-care testing, could reduce the need for the laboratory tests we provide. Our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to continually improve our offerings in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive service offerings, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nThe market for genetic and molecular testing services is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to increase. Our major competitors, including Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America, are large national laboratories that possess greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial resources and employ substantially more personnel than we do. Our competitors may develop products and services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance than our offerings. Many of our competitors have long established relationships with their customers and third-party payers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in the future.\nThe laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. Pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. As a result of the laboratory industry undergoing consolidation, larger laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. This consolidation results in greater price competition. We may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, our net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. Additionally, we may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition.\nWe face the risk of capacity constraints, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete in the market place primarily on three factors: i) the quality and accuracy of our test results; ii) the speed or turn-around times of our testing services; and iii) our ability to provide after-test support to those physicians requesting consultation. Any unforeseen increase in the volume of clients could strain the capacity of our personnel and systems, leading to unacceptable turn-around times, or customer service failures. In addition, as the number of our clients and specimens increases, our products, services, and infrastructure may not be able to scale accordingly. We may also not be able to hire additional licensed medical technologists that we need to handle increased volumes. Any failure to handle higher volume of requests for our products and services could lead to the loss of established clients and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we produce inaccurate test results, our clients may choose not to use us in the future. This could severely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, based on the importance of the subject matter of our tests, inaccurate results could result in improper treatment of patients, and potential liability for us.\nFailure to develop, or acquire licenses for, new or improved testing technologies could materially and adversely affect our revenues.\nOur industry is subject to rapidly changing technology and new product introductions. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other intellectual property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs. In addition, they could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nof our services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. We may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and we cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result. In addition, if we are unable to license new or improved technologies to expand our testing operations, our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected.\nClinical trials and research services create a risk of liability.\nWe conduct clinical trials, which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of individuals to evaluate a product\u2019s safety, determine a safe dosage range and identify side effects. Errors or omissions could occur during a clinical trial that may result in harm to study volunteers, or if unnoticed and regulatory approval received, to consumers of the drug, or that undermine the usefulness of the clinical trial or data from the clinical trial and may delay the entry of a drug to the market.\nOur contracts with the pharmaceutical firms include provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability. These provisions do not uniformly protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as gross negligence or misconduct. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by or exceeds a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage.\nOur business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.\nIn our business, we collect, generate, process or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation. In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act; and (c) the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.\nClinicians or patients using our services may sue us, and our insurance may not sufficiently cover all claims brought against us, which will increase our expenses.\nThe development, marketing, sale and performance of healthcare services expose us to the risk of litigation, including professional negligence or product liability claims were someone to allege that our tests failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the test results we provide to pathologists and oncologists or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. Damages assessed in connection with, and the costs of defending, any legal action could be substantial. We may be faced with litigation claims that exceed our insurance coverage or are not covered under any of our insurance policies. In addition, litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business if it impacts our existing and potential customer relationships, creates adverse public relations, diverts management resources from the operation of the business, or hampers our ability to otherwise conduct our business.\nWe may not be able to implement our business strategy, which could impair our ability to continue operations.\nImplementation of our business strategies will depend in large part on our ability to (i) attract and maintain a significant number of clients; (ii) effectively provide acceptable products and services to our clients; (iii) develop and license new products and technologies; (iv) obtain adequate financing on favorable terms to fund our business strategies; (v) maintain appropriate internal procedures, policies, and systems; (vi) hire, train, and retain skilled employees and management; (vii) continue to operate despite competition in the medical laboratory industry; (viii) be paid reasonable fees by government payer\u2019s that will adequately cover our costs; (ix) establish, develop and maintain our name recognition; and (x) establish and maintain beneficial relationships with third-party insurance providers and other third-party payers. Our inability to obtain or maintain any or all these factors could impair our ability to implement our business strategies successfully, which could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unsuccessful in managing our growth which could prevent us from operating profitably.\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nOur growth, including through our acquisition of the Genoptix business in December 2018, has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. To manage our expanded business and our potential growth, we must continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and billing systems and to expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations and our systems and our procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations. Our management may not be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market opportunity for our products and services. Any inability to manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, potential profitability and financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. This level of indebtedness could adversely affect our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOn June 27, 2019 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), the Company entered into a new senior secured credit agreement (the \u201cNew Credit Agreement\u201d) with PNC Bank National Association (\u201cPNC\u201d), as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The New Credit Agreement provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), a $100.0 million term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), and a $50.0 million delayed draw term loan which has an availability period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 27, 2020 (the \u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan\u201d). The Term Loan Facility and amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured on a first priority basis by a security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company. Our substantial indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and financial condition. For example:\n\u2022We could be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flows to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, make stock repurchases and fund other general corporate purposes. If we fail to meet our payment obligations or otherwise fail to comply with the covenants in our debt, including failure as a result of events beyond our control, it could result in an event of default on our debt. Upon an event of default, the lenders of that debt could elect to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to become immediately due and payable and we would be unable to access our revolving credit facility. Our debt imposes operating and financial covenants and restrictions on us, and compliance with such covenants and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to adequately finance our operations or capital needs, pursue attractive business opportunities that may arise, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay dividends, sell assets, and make capital expenditures.\n\u2022We may experience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates for those borrowings that bear interest at variable rates or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher.\n\u2022We may experience limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our businesses and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\nWe cannot assure you that cash flows, combined with additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility or any future credit facility, will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause the related risks to intensify. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before their respective maturities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt, we may default under the terms of our indebtedness, which could lead to an acceleration of the debt. We do not expect that we could repay all of our outstanding indebtedness if the repayment of such indebtedness was accelerated.\nThe failure to obtain necessary additional capital to finance growth and capital requirements, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may seek to exploit business opportunities that require more capital than we have currently available. We may not be able to raise such capital on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our anticipated expansion, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $173 million and approximately $131 million in available borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain our capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, there could be a material adverse effect on our long-term business, rate of growth, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions with our legacy business, the anticipated benefits of such transaction may not be realized.\nAcquisitions require us to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the acquired company\u2019s business practices and operations with our own. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, include the following:\n\u2022the potential inability to successfully combine the acquired company\u2019s business with our legacy business in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost synergies expected to be achieved when expected, or at all, and other benefits anticipated to result from such transaction;\n\u2022challenges optimizing the customer information and technology of the two companies, including the goal of consolidating to one laboratory information system and one billing system;\n\u2022challenges effectuating any diversification strategy, including challenges achieving revenue growth from sales of each company\u2019s products and services to the customers of the other company;\n\u2022difficulties offering products and services across our expanded portfolio;\n\u2022the need to revisit assumptions about reserves, revenues, capital expenditures, and operating costs, including expected synergies;\n\u2022challenges faced by a potential diversion of the attention of our management as a result of the integration, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of such transaction;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, customers, managed care contracts or strategic partners, or the ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to integrate and operate the acquired business;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022costs and challenges related to the integration of the acquired company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting with ours; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses.\nWe cannot be assured that all of the goals and anticipated benefits of an acquisition will be achievable, particularly as the achievement of the benefits are in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control. These factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and to business and the reactions of investors and analysts.\nIf we cannot integrate our legacy business with any future business we may acquire successfully, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of such transaction, including the anticipated cost synergies. We could also encounter additional transaction and integration costs or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates.\nWe may incur greater costs than anticipated, which could result in sustained losses.\nWe use reasonable efforts to assess and predict the expenses necessary to pursue our business strategies. However, implementing our business strategies may require more employees, capital equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than management has predicted, particularly as we continue to assess any further needs resulting from the integration of Genoptix. Similarly, the cost of compensating additional management, employees and consultants or other operating costs may be more than we estimate, which could result in ongoing and sustained losses.\nOther manufacturers may discontinue or recall testing products used in our business.\nWe rely heavily on reagents, test kits and instruments manufactured by third parties in our testing services. From time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall the reagents, test kits or instruments used by us to perform laboratory testing. Such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect our costs, testing volume, costs and revenues.\nWe may face fluctuations in our results of operations and we are subject to seasonality in our business which could negatively affect our business operations.\nManagement expects that our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the continued rate of growth, usage and acceptance of our products and services; (ii) demand\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nfor our products and services; (iii) the introduction and acceptance of new or enhanced products or services by us or by competitors; (iv) our ability to anticipate and effectively adapt to developing markets and to rapidly changing technologies; (v) our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; (vi) the initiation, renewal or expiration of significant contracts with any major clients; (vii) pricing changes by us, our suppliers or our competitors; (viii) seasonality; and (ix) general economic conditions and other factors. Accordingly, future sales and operating results are difficult to forecast. Our expenses are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and to a significant extent are relatively fixed, at least in the short-term. We may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in relation to our expectations would likely have an immediate adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may determine from time to time to make certain pricing or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a short-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and may not result in the long-term benefits intended. Furthermore, in Florida, historically our largest referral market for laboratory testing services, a meaningful percentage of the population, returns to homes in the Northern United States to avoid the hot summer months. This combined with the usual summer vacation schedules of our clients usually results in seasonality in our business. Because of all of the foregoing factors, our operating results in future periods could be less than the expectations of investors.\nWe depend substantially upon third parties for payment of services, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business consists of clinical laboratories that provide medical testing services for doctors, hospitals, and other laboratories on patient specimens that are sent to our laboratory. In the case of some specimen referrals that are received for patients that are not in-patients or out-patients at a hospital or institution or otherwise sent by another reference laboratory, we typically bill the patient\u2019s insurance company or a government program for our services. As such, we rely on the cooperation of numerous third-party payers, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, and various insurance companies, to get paid for performing services on behalf of our clients and their patients. The amount of such third-party payments is governed by contractual relationships in cases where we are a participating provider for a specified insurance company or by established government reimbursement rates in cases where we are an approved provider for a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. However, we do not have contractual relationships with some of the insurance companies with whom we deal, nor are we necessarily able to become an approved provider for all government programs. In such cases, we are deemed to be a non-participating provider and there is no contractual assurance that we will be able to collect the amounts billed to such insurance companies or government programs. Currently, we are not a participating provider with some of the insurance companies we bill for our services. Until such time we become a participating provider with such insurance companies, there can be no contractual assurance that we will be paid for the services we bill to such insurance companies or patients, and such third-parties may change their reimbursement policies for non-participating providers in a manner that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow or results of operations. When new Current Procedural Terminology (\u201cCPT\u201d) codes are introduced by the American Medical Association it often takes time for commercial insurance providers to recognize the new codes, which can significantly impact the timing of payments, if any, and can increase our days-sales-outstanding. Medicare has also, at times, issued codes or coding guidance that conflicts with the AMA CPT coding, which can cause confusion when secondary insurance is involved. Insurance companies may also try to steer business away from us towards in-network providers by sending letters to physicians and even imposing financial penalties if they continue to send us business.\nWe may fail to protect our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our laboratory operations against physical damage from explosions, fire, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. We do not presently have an emergency back-up generator in place at our Tampa, Florida, Nashville, Tennessee, Atlanta, Georgia, Rolle, Switzerland or Fresno, California laboratories locations which would otherwise mitigate to some extent the effects of a prolonged power outage. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in service to clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate, which could result in infringement or misappropriation by third-parties.\nWe regard our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely upon trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, clients, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. The steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate or third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights. In addition, other parties may assert infringement claims against us.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and need to hire additional qualified personnel in order for our business to succeed.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key technical personnel. In particular, our success depends substantially on the continued efforts of our senior management team. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, our medical staff, our laboratory directors or other key employees could have a material\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and our financial condition. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial and technical personnel, as we grow. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain our key managerial and technical employees or may not be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial and technical personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our ability to retain existing clients for our specialized diagnostic services and attract new clients is dependent upon retaining existing sales representatives and hiring and training new sales representatives, which is an expensive and time-consuming process. We face intense competition for qualified sales personnel and our inability to hire or retain an adequate number of sales representatives could limit our ability to maintain or expand our business and increase sales. Even if we are able to increase our sales force, our new sales personnel may not commit the necessary resources or provide sufficient high quality service and attention to effectively market and sell our services. If we are unable to maintain and expand our marketing and sales networks or if our sales personnel do not perform to our standards, we may be unable to maintain or grow our existing business and our results of operations and financial condition will likely suffer accordingly. If a sales representative ceases employment, we risk the loss of client goodwill based on the impairment of relationships developed between the sales representative and the healthcare professionals for whom the sales representative was responsible. This is particularly a risk if the representative goes to work for a competitor, as the healthcare professionals that are our clients may choose to use a competitor\u2019s services based on their relationship with our former sales representative.\nFurther, non-compliant activities and unlawful conduct by sales and marketing personnel could give rise to significant risks under the AKS. We require extensive, comprehensive training of all sales and marketing personnel, but cannot guarantee that every staff member will comply with the training. Thus, in addition to the cost of training sales and marketing personnel, we could face liability under the AKS for non-compliance by individuals engaged in prohibited sales and marketing activities.\nFailure in our information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt our operations.\nOur laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. Sustained system failures or interruption of our systems in one or more of our laboratory operations could disrupt our ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. Breaches with respect to personally identifiable information and protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) could result in violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d), and analogous state laws that protect the privacy, confidentiality and security of such information, and risk the imposition of significant fines and penalties. Failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carrier could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and harm our reputation and ability to provide our specialized diagnostic services on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. One of our marketing strategies entails highlighting the reliability of our point-to-point transport of patient samples. We rely heavily on a single provider of transport services, FedEx Corporation (the \u201cCarrier\u201d) for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of patient samples to our laboratory and enhanced tracking of these patient samples. Should the Carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of a sample, it may be difficult to replace our patient samples in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our services and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions by delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to receive and process patient samples on a timely basis. If the Carrier or we were to terminate our relationship, we would be required to find another party to provide expedited, reliable point-to-point transport of our patient samples. There are only a few other providers of such nationwide transport services, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into arrangements with such other providers on acceptable terms, if at all. Finding a new provider of transport services would be time-consuming and costly and result in delays in our ability to provide our specialized diagnostic services. Even if we were to enter into an arrangement with such provider, there can be no assurance that they will provide the same level of quality in transport services currently provided to us by the Carrier. If the new provider does not provide the required quality and reliable transport services, it could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use biological and hazardous materials that require considerable expertise and expense for handling, storage or disposal and may result in claims against us\nWe work with hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds, blood samples and other human tissue that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous and bio hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage,\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nhandling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair business efforts. If we do not comply with applicable regulations, we may be subject to fines and penalties. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Our general liability insurance and/or workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy may not cover damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our operations could be suspended or otherwise adversely affected.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, which means that it could decline substantially within a short period of time. The price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons including the following:\n\u2022future announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022regulatory developments and enforcement actions bearing on advertising, marketing or sales;\n\u2022reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones and metrics set forth in such reports; gaining or losing large customers or managed care plans;\n\u2022introduction of new products or services and related insurance coverage;\n\u2022acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our services;\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022business acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022changes in the regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d);\n\u2022changes in governmental or third-party reimbursement practices and rates; and fluctuations in the economy, political events or general market conditions.\nIn addition, stock markets in general and the market for shares of health care stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, fluctuations that frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance.\nAn epidemic of the coronavirus disease is ongoing in China and other parts of the world and may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nAn epidemic of the coronavirus disease is ongoing in China and other parts of the world. As the outbreak is still evolving, much of its impact remains unknown. It is impossible to predict the effect and potential spread of the coronavirus in China and globally. Should the coronavirus continue to spread or not be contained in China or other parts of the world, our business operations could be delayed or interrupted. China has implemented travel bans to contain the coronavirus, and several countries are placing certain limitations on travelers. If bans are implemented and extended to other countries, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Regulation\nIf we were required to conduct additional clinical trials prior to continuing to sell our current tests or launching any other tests we may develop, those trials could result in delays or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which could harm our business.\nIn the event that, in the future, the FDA begins to regulate our tests, it may require additional pre-market clinical testing prior to submitting a regulatory notification or application for commercial sales. Such pre-market clinical testing could delay the commencement or completion of clinical testing, significantly increase our test development costs, delay commercialization of any future tests, and interrupt sales of our current tests. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nWe may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials, which might increase the cost and complexity of our trials. We may also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform the trials. If these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing or approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our tests. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our tests and/or to achieve sustained profitability.\nProposed government regulation of LDTs may result in delays to launching certain laboratory tests and increase our costs to implement new tests.\nWe frequently develop diagnostic tests for clients that cannot currently be provided using test kits approved or cleared by the FDA. The FDA has been considering changes to the way that it regulates these Laboratory Developed Tests. Currently all LDTs are conducted and offered in accordance with the CLIA, and individual state licensing procedures. The FDA has published a draft guidance document that would require FDA clearance or approval of a subset of LDTs, as well as a modified approach for some lower risk LDTs that may require FDA oversight short of the full premarket approval or clearance process. Congress may enact legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the FDA\u2019s role with regard to LDTs. As a result, there is a risk that the FDA\u2019s proposed regulatory process could delay the offering of certain tests and result in additional validation costs and fees. There is also an associated risk for us that some tests currently offered might become subject to FDA premarket approval or clearance. This FDA approval or clearance process may be time-consuming and costly, with no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance.\nOn July 31, 2014 the FDA issued a notification to Congress of the \u201cAnticipated Details of the Draft Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff, and Clinical Laboratories: Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,\u201d or the Draft LDT Guidance. As described in this notification, the FDA planned to provide draft guidance to clinical laboratories that develop their own LDTs regarding how the FDA intends to regulate such laboratories under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. On October 3, 2014 the FDA issued the draft guidance to clinical laboratories. The regulatory framework will use a risk-based approach to enforce the FDA\u2019s premarket review requirements, and for high-risk tests, the framework may require laboratories to use FDA-approved tests, if available, rather than LDTs. If implemented, the framework outlined in the Draft LDT Guidance may also require us to obtain premarket clearance or approval for certain of our LDTs. Implementation of this framework would include a lengthy phase-in period ranging from two to nine years depending on the risk assessment rating of each particular test. The FDA provided an opportunity for public comment through February 2015 and received numerous public comments in response to the Draft LDT Guidance. In January 2017 the FDA announced that it would not issue a final guidance on the oversight of LDTs at the request of various stakeholders to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach, and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. At the same time, Congress, the FDA, and various industry stakeholders have worked to provide recommendations for comprehensive reform of LDTs. Recently, Congress has submitted a legislative discussion draft, the Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act (\u201cDAIA\u201d) to the FDA and requested technical assistance on the draft. FDA's technical assistance consisted of recommendations for significant changes in the bill. In December 2018, Congress released an updated bill, the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (\u201cVALID\u201d) Act that is largely consistent with the FDA's technical assistance on DAIA. However, it remains unknown whether Congress will enact legislation regulating LDTs and, if so, whether the legislation will be similar to the framework described in the Draft LDT Guidance, or in the VALID act. This legislation and resulting FDA regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to register and continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests and may increase our costs. We do not yet know which of our tests would be classified as high-risk and would require a full FDA approval. If such approval was required, we cannot be certain that our tests would obtain FDA approval or clearance.\nIf the FDA and/or congressional authorizing committees begin to regulate our tests, it could require a significant volume of applications with the FDA and/or document responses to congressional authorizing committees which would be burdensome. Furthermore, FDA and/or congressional authorizing committees could take a long time to review such applications and/or document responses if every laboratory in the country files a large volume of applications and/or document responses for each of their LDTs.\nIn November of 2017, CMS initiated a national coverage analysis for the use of Next Generation Sequencing \u201cNGS\u201d diagnostic tests for patients with advanced cancer. The proposed decision memo was released and open to a public comment period. On March 16, 2018, CMS issued a final decision memorandum for NGS as a diagnostic laboratory test and determined it to be reasonable and necessary and covered nationally, when performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, when ordered by a treating physician and when all of the following requirements are met: (a) the patient has either recurrent, relapsed, refractory, metastatic, or advanced stages III or IV cancer; (b) the patient has either not been previously tested using the same NGS test for the same primary diagnosis of cancer or has had repeat testing using the same NGS test only when a new primary cancer\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\ndiagnosis is made by the treating physician; and (c) the patient has decided to seek further cancer treatment (e.g., therapeutic chemotherapy). CMS also determined that the diagnostic laboratory test using NGS must have: FDA approval or clearance as a companion in vitro diagnostic; an FDA approved or cleared indication for use in that patient\u2019s cancer; and results provided to the treating physician for management of the patient using a report template to specify treatment options. On October 29, 2019, CMS issued a proposed decision memo open to a public comment period that would expand coverage of NGS test when performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, when ordered by a treating physician and when all of the following requirements are met (a) the patient has ovarian or breast cancer; (b) the patient has clinical indications for germline (inherited) testing; (c) the patient has risk factors for germline (inherited) breast or ovarian cancer; and (d) the patient has not been previously tested using NGS. These CMS changes to reimbursement for NGS testing could directly affect our revenue for this test type.\nHealthcare reform programs may impact our business and the pricing we receive for our services.\nIn March of 2010, health care reform legislation known as the \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\u201d also known as the ACA, was passed into law. The ACA also makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and clinical laboratories. For example, the ACA contains several provisions that seek to limit Medicare spending in the future. One key provision in the ACA is the establishment of \u201cAccountable Care Organizations,\u201d or (\u201cACOs\u201d), under which hospitals and physicians are able to share savings that result from improved coordination of health care. We cannot predict how the continued establishment and implementation of these new business models will impact our business. There is the possibility that value-based payment models, such as ACOs, will drive down the utilization and/or reimbursement rates for our services. We may not be able to gain access into certain ACOs. These changes could have an adverse and material impact on our operations.\nThe ACA provided for states to create health insurance \u201cMarketplaces\u201d where individuals can compare and enroll in Qualified Health Plans, (\u201cQHPs\u201d). Individuals with an income less than 400% of the federal poverty level that purchase insurance on a Marketplace may be eligible for federal subsidies to cover a portion of their health insurance premium costs and cost-sharing of co-insurance or co-pay obligations. Our patients may be enrolled in QHPs, and we may begin to submit bills to QHPs for services we provide. The presence of federal funds in QHPs in the form of subsidies and cost-sharing may subject providers to heightened government scrutiny and enforcement, which could significantly increase the cost of compliance and could materially impact our operations. For example, it is not clear whether the availability of these federal subsidies classifies a QHP as a federal healthcare program, particularly for purposes of federal fraud and abuse laws. In letters published on October 30, 2013 and February 6, 2014, the former Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services, (\u201cDHHS\u201d), Kathleen Sebelius, indicated that DHHS does not consider QHPs to be federal healthcare programs. However, a judge may not agree with this statement by Secretary Sebelius, and other government regulators, including, but not limited to the current of future Secretary of the DHHS, may take a different position. For example, subsequent letters from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley to Secretary Sebelius and Attorney General Eric Holder on November 7, 2013 and February 12, 2014 indicate that this issue remains an outstanding question. If QHPs are classified as federal healthcare programs, it could significantly increase our costs of compliance.\nIn January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. Further, in January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In December of 2017, President Trump signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, which made changes to the tax code and included, among other things, a repeal of the ACA\u2019s penalties for the individual mandate, a provision that required individuals to buy health insurance or pay a fine. On December 14, 2018 a federal district court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that Public Law No. 115-97 rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and further ruled that the rest of the ACA was inseverable from the individual mandate, rendering the ACA in its entirety invalid. In December 2019, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, and remanded the severability question back to the district court to provide additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA as they currently exist. Additionally, the ACA continues to be challenged in other lawsuits. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed or ruled invalid. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation and constitutionality of the ACA, there can be no assurance at this time that the implementation (or repeal) of these provisions, or the ACA as a whole, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSteps taken by government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including esoteric testing may diminish our net revenue.\nWe face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization as well as reimbursement for laboratory testing services. Changes in governmental reimbursement may result from statutory and regulatory changes, prospective and/or retroactive rate adjustments, administrative rulings and other policy changes.\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nFrom time to time, legislative freezes and updates affect some of our tests that are reimbursed by the Medicare program under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, (\u201cMPFS\u201d), or the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, (\u201cCLFS\u201d). The MPFS is updated on an annual basis. In the past, the MPFS was updated using a prescribed statutory formula; (i.e., the sustainable growth rate formula). The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, (\u201cMACRA\u201d), repealed the previous statutory formula and specified new annual conversion factors for calendar years 2015 and beyond. If the new annual conversion factor results in negative reimbursement in future years, the resulting decrease in payment may adversely affect our revenue, business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, recent laws have made changes to Medicare reimbursement for our tests that are reimbursed under the CLFS, many of which have already gone into effect. In June 2016, CMS published the Clinical Laboratory Fee CLFS final rule entitled \u201cMedicare Program: Medicare Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests Payment System\u201d (CMS-1621-F). The final rule provides regulations to implement the provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, (\u201cPAMA\u201d), which was signed into law in April 2014. Under the final rule, laboratories, including physician office laboratories, are required to report private payer rate and volume data if they:\n\u2022Have $12,500 or more in Medicare revenues from laboratory services on the CLFS, and\n\u2022Receive more than 50 percent of their Medicare revenues from CLFS or PFS during a data collection period.\nTests that meet the criteria for being considered new advanced tests will be paid at actual list charge during an initial period of three calendar quarters. Once the initial period is over, payment for new, advanced tests would be based on the weighted median private payer rate reported by the single laboratory that performs the new ADLT. Advanced tests are tests furnished by only one laboratory that include a unique algorithm and, at a minimum, are an analysis of RNA, DNA or proteins or are cleared or approved by the FDA.\nApplicable laboratories must report data that includes the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each test that was paid by each private payer (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations). The definition of \u201capplicable\u201d laboratory may exclude certain types of laboratories that generally receive more favorable pricing than other laboratories, and thus the make-up of laboratories reporting pricing data to CMS under the final rule may result in lower overall pricing data. Beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test is equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period. For example, applicable laboratories were required to collect private payer data from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 and report it to CMS by March 31, 2017. The new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payer rates) were released in November 2017 and were effective on January 1, 2018. For the years 2017 through 2019, the amount of reduction in the Medicare rate (if any) shall not exceed 10 percent from the prior year\u2019s rate. From January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019, applicable laboratories are required to collect private payer data and report it to CMS by March 31, 2021. The new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payer rates) will be released in November 2020 and will become effective January 1, 2021. For 2020, any reduction in the Medicare rate shall not exceed 10 percent of the 2019 rates, and for the years 2021 through 2023, any reduction in the Medicare rate shall not exceed 15 percent from the prior year\u2019s rate. It is too early to predict the impact on reimbursement for our tests reimbursed under the CLFS, though we believe the government\u2019s goal is to reduce Medicare program payments for CLFS tests. Specifically, CMS projected that the effect of this rule on the Medicare program will be a savings of $360 million in program payments for CLFS tests furnished in FY 2017, and a savings of $5.14 billion over 10 years, although estimates by the Congressional Budget Office have been significantly less. CMS also finalized its proposal that a laboratory\u2019s failure to comply with reporting obligations, or a laboratory that makes a misrepresentation or omission in reporting required information, could lead to liability under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law.\nAlso under PAMA, CMS is required to adopt temporary billing codes to identify new tests and new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests that have been cleared or approved by the FDA. For an existing test that is cleared or approved by the FDA and for which Medicare payment is made, CMS is required to assign a unique billing code if one has not already been assigned by the agency. Further, PAMA provides special payment status to \u201cadvanced diagnostic laboratory tests,\u201d (\u201cADLTs\u201d), to allow such ADLTs to be paid using their actual list charge amount during a certain time frame. We cannot determine at this time the full impact of the new law on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCMS also adopts regulations and policies, from time to time, revising, limiting or excluding coverage or reimbursement for certain of the tests that we perform. Likewise, many state governments are under budget pressures and are also considering reductions to their Medicaid fees. Further, Medicare, Medicaid and other third party payers audit for overutilization of billed services. Even though all tests performed by us are ordered by our clients, who are responsible for establishing the medical necessity for the tests ordered, we may be subject to recoupment of payments, as the recipient of the payments for such tests, in the event that a third party payer such as CMS determines that the tests failed to meet all applicable criteria for payment. When third party payers like CMS revise their coverage regulations or policies, our costs generally increase due to the complexity of complying with additional administrative requirements. Furthermore, Medicaid reimbursement and regulations vary by state. Accordingly, we are subject to varying administrative and billing regulations, which also increase the complexity of servicing such programs and our administrative costs. Finally, state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nthat may impact our business, such as delaying payments, restricting coverage eligibility, service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services.\nIn certain jurisdictions, Palmetto GBA administers the Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, (\u201cMolDx\u201d), and establishes coverage and reimbursement for certain molecular diagnostic tests, including many of our tests. To obtain Medicare coverage for a molecular diagnostic test (FDA approved or LDT), laboratories must apply for and obtain a unique test identifier or what is known as a \u201cZ\u201d code. For newly developed tests or for established tests that have not been validated for clinical and analytical validity and clinical utility, laboratories must submit a detailed dossier of clinical data to substantiate that the test meets Medicare\u2019s requirements for coverage. We have received favorable coverage for many of our molecular tests, however we have also received non-coverage determinations for many newer tests. The field of molecular diagnostics is evolving very rapidly, and clinical studies on many new tests are still underway. We cannot be assured that some of our molecular tests will ever be covered services by Medicare, nor can we determine when the medical literature will meet the standard for coverage that Medicare administrative contractors have set.\nIn recent years, Medicare has encouraged beneficiaries to participate in managed care programs, known as \u201cMedicare Advantage\u201d programs, and has encouraged beneficiaries from the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program to switch to Medicare Advantage programs. This has resulted in rapid growth of health insurance and managed care plans offering Medicare Advantage programs and growth in Medicare beneficiary enrollment in these programs. Also in recent years, many states have increasingly mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in managed care arrangements. If these efforts continue to be successful, we may experience a further shift of traditional Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries to managed care programs. As a result, we would be required to contract with those private managed care programs in order to be reimbursed for services provided to their Medicare and Medicaid members. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into agreements with these managed care programs at rates of payment similar to those we realize from our non-managed care lines of business.\nEffective January 1, 2018 CMS implemented an additional exception to the laboratory date of service rules. Prior to 2018, CMS\u2019 14-day rule prevented reference and independent laboratories such as ours from billing Medicare directly for clinical laboratory tests or the technical component of pathology services if, among other things, the tests were ordered less than 14 days following an outpatient\u2019s discharge from the hospital. Instead, we would seek reimbursement from the hospital and the hospital would bill Medicare. Effective January 1, 2018, certain molecular pathology tests and advanced diagnostic laboratory tests (\u201cADLTs\u201d) that previously had to be billed or could be billed by the hospital are now required to be billed by the performing laboratory if certain requirements are met. Since our client-bill pricing is typically higher for Molecular testing than the Medicare fee schedule, we anticipate a reduction in revenue from this policy change. Under the MolDx program there are many policies that limit reimbursement on certain tests based on diagnosis codes, and for certain tests there is no reimbursement regardless of the patient\u2019s condition.\nWe expect the initiatives described above to continue and, if they do, to reduce reimbursements for clinical laboratory services, to impose more stringent cost controls on clinical laboratory services and to reduce utilization of clinical laboratory services. These efforts, including changes in law or regulations that may occur in the future, may each individually or collectively have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nChanges in regulations, payer policies or contracting arrangements with payers or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect coverage or reimbursement for our specialized diagnostic services, which may decrease our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernmental payers, as well as private insurers and private payers, have implemented and will continue to implement measures to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical laboratory and pathology services. Congress and federal agencies, such as CMS, have, from time to time, implemented changes to laws and regulations governing healthcare service providers, including specialized diagnostic service providers. These changes have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect coverage for our services. We also believe that healthcare professionals may not use our services if third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for them. These changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may decrease our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. We will continue to be a non-contracting provider until such time as we enter into contracts with third-party payers with whom we are not currently contracted until such time as we enter into contracts with such third-party payers. Because a portion of our revenues is from third-party payers with whom we are not currently contracted, it is likely that we will be required to make positive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations, our credibility with financial analysts and investors, and our stock price.\nFailure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act, and the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nWe are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nof medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act requires, among other things, that we include in our safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles, if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace.\nFailure to comply with such federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements for us, which may be costly.\nOur net revenue will be diminished if payers do not adequately cover or reimburse our services.\nThere has been and will continue to be significant efforts by both federal and state agencies to reduce costs in government healthcare programs and otherwise implement government control of healthcare costs. In addition, private payers continually seek ways to reduce and control overall healthcare costs, and increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of healthcare services. Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new applications and services. Third-party payers, including governmental payers such as Medicare and private payers, are scrutinizing new medical products and services and may not cover or may limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for our services. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our existing tests or for tests we discover and develop, and a substantial portion of the testing for which we bill our hospital and laboratory clients is ultimately paid by third-party payers. Likewise, any pricing pressure exerted by these third party payers on our clients may, in turn, be exerted by our clients on us. If government and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our tests, it could adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and/or our financial condition.\nThird party billing is extremely complicated and results in significant additional costs to us.\nBilling for laboratory services is extremely complicated. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable laws, we must bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physician practices, employer groups, hospitals and other laboratories, all of which have different billing requirements. Additionally, we undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. Insurance companies and government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid also impose routine external audits to evaluate payments, which adds further complexity to the billing process.\nAmong others, the primary factors which complicate our billing practices are:\n\u2022pricing differences between our fee schedules and the reimbursement rates of the payers;\n\u2022changes in payer rules or contracts;\n\u2022disputes with payers as to the party who is responsible for payment;\n\u2022disparity in coverage and information requirements among various carriers; and\n\u2022differing pre-authorization requirements across payers.\nWe incur significant additional costs as a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory services are subject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations. The additional costs we expect to incur include those related to: (i) complexity added to our billing processes and systems; (ii) training and education of our employees and clients; (iii) implementing compliance procedures and oversight; (iv) collections and legal costs; and (v) costs associated with, among other factors, challenging coverage and payment denials and providing patients with information regarding claims processing and services, such as advance beneficiary notices.\nOur operations are subject to strict laws prohibiting fraudulent billing and other abuse, and our failure to comply with such laws could result in substantial penalties.\nOf particular importance to our operations is ensuring compliance with federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent billing and the retention of overpayments. In particular, if we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding and billing rules, we could be subject to liability under the federal False Claims Act, including civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The False Claims Act prohibits individuals and companies from knowingly submitting false claims for payments to, or improperly retaining overpayments from, the government.\nIf an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $10,461 and $52,308 for each separate false claim. Further, False Claims Act liability may lead to exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. There are a number of potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act. For example, liability arises when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a claim for reimbursement to the federal government for a\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nservice which was not provided or which did not qualify for reimbursement. Submitting a claim with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of its truth or falsity could also result in liability under the False Claims Act. Following enactment of the ACA, knowing retention of overpayments is also considered a false claim and could lead to liability under the False Claims Act.\nThe False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or \u201cqui tam\u201d provisions are being used with more frequency to challenge the reimbursement practices of providers and suppliers. Those provisions allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has submitted false claims for payment to the government. The government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and whether to prosecute the case. If it declines to do so, the individual may pursue the case alone, although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the majority of any recovery. The successful qui tam relator who brought the case is entitled to a portion of the proceeds and his or her attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In addition, various states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act, which prohibit submitting false claims for payment to the state or, in some states, to other commercial payers. If we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding, and billing rules, we could be subject to liability under analogous state laws as well as criminal liability through a variety of federal and state criminal statutes.\nGovernment investigations of clinical laboratories have been ongoing for a number of years and are expected to continue in the future. When we submit bills for our services to third-party payers, we must follow complex documentation, coding and billing rules which are based on federal and state laws, rules and regulations, various government publications, and on industry practice. A large number of laboratories have entered into substantial settlements with the federal and state governments for alleged noncompliance under these laws and rules. Private payers have also brought civil actions against laboratories which have resulted in substantial judgments. Failure to follow these rules could result in potential civil liability under the False Claims Act, under which extensive financial penalties can be imposed. It could further result in criminal liability under various federal and state criminal statutes. For example, there are various state and federal laws and rules regulating laboratory billing practices, such as prohibiting a clinical laboratory from charging a higher price for tests ordered by a physician and provided by a third-party (anti-markup rules) as well as requiring a laboratory performing certain laboratory tests to directly bill Medicare instead of the ordering provider (direct billing rules).\nWe submit thousands of claims for payment to governmental programs and private payers, and we cannot guarantee that there have not been errors in our claims. While we maintain a robust compliance program that includes consistent, detailed review of our documentation, and coding and billing practices, the rules are frequently vague, complex, and continually changing and we cannot assure that governmental authorities, private insurers or private whistleblowers will not challenge our practices. Such a challenge could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe failure to comply with significant government regulation and laboratory operations may subject us to liability, penalties or limitation of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive state and federal regulatory oversight. Specifically, our laboratories must satisfy federal requirements under CLIA and to maintain the appropriate CLIA Certificate for all testing performed at the lab. Additionally, most states have adopted various laws and regulations setting standards for laboratories performing clinical laboratory testing and requiring laboratories to obtain and maintain a state laboratory license before the laboratory is authorized to perform testing. These state licensure laws address a host of requirements and often include permissible and prohibited practices involving digital health, including but not limited to telehealth and telepathology.\nUpon periodic inspection or survey, our laboratory locations may be found to be non-compliant with CLIA requirements or with applicable state licensure or certification laws. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA, state licensure requirements, or other applicable laws and regulations could include the suspension, revocation, or limitation of the right to perform clinical laboratory services or receive compensation for those services, as well as the requirement to enter into a corrective action plan to monitor compliance, and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or administrative fines. In addition, any new legislation or regulation or the application of existing laws and regulations in ways that we have not anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExisting federal laws governing Medicare and Medicaid, as well as some other state and federal laws, also regulate certain aspects of the relationship between healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories, and their referral sources, including physicians, hospitals and other laboratories. Certain of these laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statutes (\u201cAKS\u201d) and the federal physician self-referral law (the \u201cStark Law\u201d) contain extremely broad proscriptions. Violation of these laws may result in criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, repayment of all reimbursement received by us related to services tied to any impermissible referrals, and significant civil monetary penalties, as well as False Claims Act liability. We seek to structure our arrangements with physicians and other clients to be in compliance with the federal AKS, Stark Law and similar state laws, and to keep up-to-date on developments concerning their application by various means, including consultation with legal counsel and review of the annual Work Plan by the Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) identifying targeted issues. We cannot guarantee, however, that government authorities will not take a contrary view and impose civil monetary penalties and exclude us based on our arrangements with physicians and other clients.\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nThe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, (\u201cfederal CMP Law\u201d), imposes civil monetary penalties and potential exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs on any person who offers or transfers remuneration to any patient who is a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, when the person knows or should know that the remuneration is likely to induce the patient to receive medical services from a particular provider. The federal CMP Law applies, among other things, to many kinds of inducements or benefits provided to patients, including complimentary items, services or transportation that are of more than nominal value. We have structured our operations and provision of services to patients in a manner that we believe complies with the law and its interpretation by government authorities. We cannot guarantee, however, that government authorities will not take a contrary view and impose civil monetary penalties and exclude us from participation in Medicare and Medicaid for past or present practices related to patient incentive, coordination of care and need-based programs.\nFurthermore, HIPAA, the HITECH Act, (as implemented through HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security regulations) and similar state laws contain provisions that require the electronic exchange of health information, such as claims submission and receipt of remittances, using standard transactions and code sets, which we refer to as \u201cStandards\u201d, and regulate the use and disclosure of patient records and other PHI. These provisions, which address security and confidentiality of patient information as well as the administrative aspects of claims handling, have very broad applicability and govern many healthcare providers, including physicians and clinical laboratories. Although we believe we are in material compliance with the Standards, the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, and applicable state privacy and security laws, a failure to comply with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our financial condition and could subject us to liability. Additionally, while there is no private right of action under HIPAA, state Attorneys General may bring an action against a covered entity, such as us, for a violation of HIPAA, and the federal Office for Civil Rights can impose fines and penalties.\nThe failure to comply with physician self-referral laws may subject us to liability, penalties or limitation of operations.\nWe are subject to the federal Stark Law, as well as similar state statutes and regulations, which prohibit payments for certain health care services, which are referred to as designated health services (\u201cDHS\u201d), rendered as a result of referrals by physicians to DHS entities with which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have a financial relationship. A \u201cfinancial relationship\u201d includes both an ownership interest and/or a compensation arrangement with a physician, both direct and indirect, and DHS includes, but is not limited to, laboratory services. The Stark Law prohibits an entity that receives a prohibited DHS referral from seeking payment from Medicare for any DHS services performed as a result of such a referral, unless an arrangement is carefully structured to satisfy every requirement of a regulatory exception. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, and thus any technical violation requires repayment of all \u201ctainted\u201d referrals, regardless of the intent, unless an exception applies. Penalties for violating the Stark Law may include the denial of payment to an entity for the impermissible provision of DHS, the requirement to refund any amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law, and civil monetary penalties of up to $25,372 for each violation and $169,153 for each circumvention arrangement or scheme. The amounts may be further increased by civil monetary penalty increases imposed by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Other implications of a Stark Law violation may include exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and potential False Claims Act liability, including via \u201cqui tam\u201d action.\nFurther, many states have promulgated self-referral laws and regulations similar to the federal Stark Law, but these vary significantly based on the state. In addition to services reimbursed by Medicaid or government payers, often these state laws and regulations can encompass services reimbursed by private payers as well. Penalties for violating state self-referral laws and regulations vary based on the state, but often include civil penalties, exclusion from Medicaid, and loss of licenses.\nOur financial arrangements with physicians are governed by the federal Stark Law, and we rely on certain exceptions to the Stark Law with respect to such relationships. While we believe that our financial relationships with physicians and physician practices are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that government authorities would agree. If we are found by the government to be in violation of the Stark Law, we could be subject to significant penalties, including fines as specified above, exclusion from participation in government and private payer programs and requirements to refund amounts previously received from government. Further, as our operations expand into new states and jurisdictions, we must continually evaluate whether our relationships with physicians comply with that jurisdiction\u2019s laws. This may require structural and organizational modifications to our relationships with physicians which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to comply with Anti-Kickback laws may subject us to liability, penalties or limitation of operations\nWe are subject to the federal AKS, which prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federally funded healthcare program. The AKS defines remuneration to include anything of value, in cash or in kind, and thus can implicate financial relationships involving payments not commensurate with fair market value, such as in the form of space, equipment leases, professional or technical services or anything else of value.\nThe AKS is an \u201cintent-based\u201d statute, meaning that a violation occurs when one or both parties intend the remuneration to be in exchange for or to induce referrals. In 2010, the ACA, amended the intent requirement of the AKS. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that a claim\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nsubmitted for reimbursement for items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.\nThere are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. Violations of the AKS may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $102,522, imprisonment of up to ten years, civil penalties under the federal CMP Law of up to $102,522 for each violation, plus three times the remuneration involved, civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act of a maximum of $52,308 for each claim submitted, plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we face these penalties or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, it could significantly reduce our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, most states have adopted similar anti-kickback laws prohibiting the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration in exchange for referrals, and typically impose criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licenses. Some of these state laws apply to items and services paid for by private payers as well as by government payers. In addition, many states have adopted laws prohibiting the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and non-physicians, as well as between treating physicians and referral sources. We believe our arrangements with physicians comply with the AKS, and state anti-kickback and fee splitting laws of the states in which we operate, however, if government authorities were to disagree, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and be required to restructure or terminate our contractual and other arrangements with physicians. This could result in a loss of revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome states have also adopted laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, or prohibiting business corporations from employing physicians or engaging in activities considered to be the \u201cpractice of medicine.\u201d In these states, we rely on service agreements with physicians and/or professional associations owned by physicians, to perform needed professional pathology services. We cannot assure you that a physician or physician\u2019s professional organization will not seek to terminate an agreement with us on any basis, nor can we assure you that governmental authorities in those states will not seek termination of these arrangements on the basis of state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine.\nA failure to comply with governmental payer regulations could result in our being excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental payer programs.\nTests which are reimbursed by Medicare and other Government payers (for example, State Medicaid programs) accounted for approximately 18%, 15% and 14% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Medicare program imposes extensive and detailed requirements on diagnostic service providers, including, but not limited to, rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians, how and when we submit claims for reimbursement and how we provide specialized diagnostic laboratory services. Further, we are prohibited from contracting with any individuals or entities who have been excluded from participation in Medicare or Medicaid and are listed on the OIG\u2019s List of Excluded Individuals and Entities List (\u201cLEIE\u201d) or in the System for Award Management, which includes the previously independent Government Services Administration\u2019s Excluded Parties List System (\u201cGSA-EPLS\u201d). Contracting with excluded individuals or entities, such as hiring an excluded person or contracting with an excluded vendor, can result in significant penalties.\nOur failure to comply with applicable Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental payer rules could result in our inability to participate in a governmental payer program, an obligation to repay funds already paid to us for services performed, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties, False Claims Act liability and/or limitations on the operational function of our laboratory. If we were unable to receive reimbursement under a governmental payer program, a substantial portion of our revenues would be lost, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Regulations may increase our operational costs.\nThe HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of PHI by certain entities including health plans and health care providers, and set standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic medical records. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework governing the use and disclosure of PHI, including, for example, the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient; a patient\u2019s right to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI; the content of notices of privacy practices describing how PHI is used and disclosed and individuals\u2019 rights with respect to their PHI; and implementation of administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect privacy and security of PHI. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose certain individually identifiable patient health information, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or health care operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations do not supersede state laws that may be more stringent; therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws and regulations.\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nThe HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require healthcare providers like us to notify affected individuals, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and in some cases, the media, when PHI has been \u201cbreached\u201d, as defined by HIPAA. Many states have similar breach notification laws. In the event of a breach, we could incur substantial operational and financial costs related to mitigation and remediation, including preparation and delivery of notices to affected individuals. Additionally, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations provide for significant civil fines, criminal penalties, and other sanctions for failure to comply with the privacy, security, and breach notification rules, including for wrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of PHI. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of action for damages, we could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. Additionally, HIPAA allows state Attorneys General to bring an action against a covered entity, such as us, for a violation of HIPAA. We insure some of our risk with respect to HIPAA security breaches, but operational costs and penalties associated with HIPAA breaches easily could exceed our insured limits.\nWe are subject to security risks which could harm our operations.\nHIPAA imposes additional requirements, restrictions and penalties on covered entities and their business associates to, among other things, deter breaches of security. As a result, required preventative and remedial actions, along with the aforementioned reporting requirements, and sanctions for a breach are stringent. Our electronic health records system is periodically modified to meet applicable security standards. Despite the implementation of various security measures by us, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and other disruptive problems inadvertently introduced by authorized users such as employees and clients, or purposefully targeted by hackers and other cybercriminals which could lead to interruption, delays or cessation in service to our clients. Further, such incidents, whether electronic or physical, could jeopardize the security of confidential information, including PHI and other sensitive information stored in our computer systems related to clients, patients, and other parties connected through us, which may deter potential clients and give rise to uncertain liability to parties whose security or privacy has been infringed. A significant security breach could result in fines, loss of clients, damage to our reputation, direct damages, costs of repair and detection, costs to remedy the breach, government penalties, and other expenses. We insure some of our risk with respect to security breaches but the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 13704, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "NEO"}
