{"cik": "1143068", "company": "GREAT PLAINS ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to the Anticipated Merger with Westar:\nThe value of the shares of Holdco common stock that Great Plains Energy's shareholders receive upon the consummation of the anticipated merger may be less than the value of the shares of Great Plains Energy\ncommon stock as of the date of the Amended Merger Agreement, the date of this report or the date of the shareholders' meeting.\nThe exchange ratio for Great Plains Energy in the Amended Merger Agreement is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the stock price of Great Plains Energy prior to the anticipated merger. A significant amount of time will have elapsed between the dates when the shareholders of Great Plains Energy voted to approve the Amended Merger Agreement at the shareholders' meeting on November 21, 2017, and the date when the anticipated merger is completed. The absolute and relative price of shares of Great Plains Energy common stock may vary significantly between the date of the meetings, the date of this report and the date of the completion of the anticipated merger. These variations may be caused by, among other things, changes in the businesses, operations, results or prospects of Great Plains Energy and Westar, market expectations of the likelihood that the anticipated merger will be completed and the timing of completion, the prospects of post-merger operations, general market and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, it is impossible to predict accurately the market price of the Holdco common stock to be received by Great Plains Energy shareholders after the completion of the anticipated merger. Accordingly, the price of Great Plains Energy common stock on the date of this report and on the date of the meetings may not be indicative of the price immediately prior to completion of the anticipated merger and the price of Holdco common stock after the anticipated merger is completed.\nThe ability of Great Plains Energy and Westar to complete the anticipated merger is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect Great Plains Energy or cause the anticipated merger to be abandoned.\nTo complete the anticipated merger, (1) each of Great Plains Energy and Westar must also make certain filings with and obtain certain consents and approvals from various governmental and regulatory authorities, (2) the listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of Holdco common stock to be issued to Great Plains Energy and Westar shareholders in the anticipated merger must be approved, (3) there cannot be any material adverse effect with respect to Great Plains Energy, Westar and their respective subsidiaries, (4) there cannot be any laws or judgments, whether preliminary, temporary or permanent, which may prevent, make illegal or prohibit the completion of the anticipated merger, (5) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the representations and warranties made by Great Plains Energy and Westar, respectively, must be accurate and the parties must comply with their respective obligations under the Amended Merger Agreement, (6) Great Plains Energy and Westar must receive certain tax opinions, (7) there cannot be any shares of Great Plains Energy preference stock outstanding and (8) Great Plains Energy must have not less than $1.25 billion in cash or cash equivalents on its balance sheet. If the foregoing conditions are not satisfied or waived, one or both of Great Plains Energy and Westar would not be required to complete the merger.\nGreat Plains Energy and Westar have not yet obtained the regulatory consents and approvals required to complete the anticipated merger. Governmental or regulatory agencies could seek to block or challenge the anticipated merger or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the anticipated merger. Great Plains Energy and Westar will be unable to complete the anticipated merger until the consents and approvals have been received from KCC, the MPSC, the NRC, FERC and The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) (collectively referred to as the \u201crequired governmental approvals\u201d). Regulatory authorities may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval. The Amended Merger Agreement may require Great Plains Energy and/or Westar to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company. If the required governmental approvals are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement, then neither Great Plains Energy nor Westar will be obligated to complete the anticipated merger.\nIn December 2017, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) granted Great Plains Energy's request for early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act.\nEven after the statutory waiting period under the antitrust laws and even after completion of the anticipated merger, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the anticipated merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a private party could initiate an action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the anticipated merger, before or after it is completed. Great Plains\nEnergy or Westar may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.\nThe shareholders' meetings at which the Great Plains Energy shareholders and the Westar shareholders voted to approve the transactions contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement took place before all such approvals have been obtained and before the terms of any conditions to obtain such approvals that may be imposed are known. As a result, Great Plains Energy and Westar may make decisions after the meetings to waive a condition or approve certain actions required to obtain necessary approvals without seeking further shareholder approval. Such actions could have an adverse effect on the combined company.\nIn addition, the Amended Merger Agreement contains other customary closing conditions, which may not be satisfied or waived.\nIf Great Plains Energy and Westar are unable to complete the anticipated merger, Great Plains Energy would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nGreat Plains Energy would not realize the anticipated benefits of the anticipated merger, including, among other things, increased operating efficiencies and future cost savings;\n\u2022\nthe attention of management of Great Plains Energy may have been diverted to the anticipated merger rather than to its own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the anticipated merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u2022\nGreat Plains Energy will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their businesses, which may prevent Great Plains Energy from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the anticipated merger is pending; and\n\u2022\nthe trading price of Great Plains Energy common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the anticipated merger will be completed.\nGreat Plains Energy can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the required governmental approvals and other approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the anticipated merger. In addition, Great Plains Energy can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the anticipated merger. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on the companies' results of operations and the trading price of Great Plains Energy common stock.\nThe Amended Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit Great Plains Energy's ability to pursue alternatives to the anticipated merger, could discourage a potential acquirer of Great Plains Energy from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Great Plains Energy to pay a termination fee to the other party.\nUnder the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy and Westar each are restricted from entering into alternative transactions. Unless and until the Amended Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, each party is restricted from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging, inducing or facilitating, or participating in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or cooperating in any way with any person with respect to, any alternative proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative proposal. Great Plains Energy and Westar each may terminate the Amended Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the provisions of the Amended Merger Agreement restricting solicitation of alternative proposals and requiring payment of a termination fee in certain circumstances. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Great Plains Energy from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher market value\nthan the market value proposed to be received or realized in the anticipated merger, or might result in a potential acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. As a result of these restrictions, Great Plains Energy may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring potentially significant liability to Westar.\nThe Amended Merger Agreement provides that in connection with the termination of the Amended Merger Agreement under specified circumstances relating to a failure to obtain regulatory approvals, a final and nonappealable order enjoining the consummation of the anticipated merger in connection with regulatory approvals or failure by Great Plains Energy to comply with its obligations under the Amended Merger Agreement to consummate the closing of the anticipated merger once all of the conditions have been satisfied, Great Plains Energy may be required to pay Westar a termination fee of $190 million. In addition, in the event that the Amended Merger Agreement is terminated by Westar under certain circumstances to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal, Westar may be required to pay Great Plains Energy a termination fee of $190 million. Similarly, in the event that the Amended Merger Agreement is terminated by Great Plains Energy under certain circumstances to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal, Great Plains Energy may be required to pay Westar a termination fee of $190 million.\nGreat Plains Energy will be subject to various uncertainties while the anticipated merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, or customers.\nUncertainty about the effect of the anticipated merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Great Plains Energy. These uncertainties may impair the ability of Great Plains Energy to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the anticipated merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with Great Plains Energy to seek to change or terminate existing business relationships with Great Plains Energy or not enter into new relationships or transactions.\nEmployee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the anticipated merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite Great Plains Energy's retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to continue employment because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, Great Plains Energy's financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, the combined company's operational and financial performance following the anticipated merger could be adversely affected if it is unable to retain key employees and skilled workers of Great Plains Energy. The loss of the services of key employees and skilled workers and their experience and knowledge regarding Great Plains Energy's businesses could adversely affect the combined company's future operating results and the successful ongoing operation of its businesses.\nGreat Plains Energy is subject to contractual restrictions in the Amended Merger Agreement that may hinder its operations pending the anticipated merger.\nThe Amended Merger Agreement restricts Great Plains Energy, without Westar's consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the anticipated merger occurs or the Amended Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent Great Plains Energy from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to completion of the anticipated merger or termination of the Amended Merger Agreement.\nFailure to complete the anticipated merger, or significant delays in completing the anticipated merger, could negatively affect the trading price of Great Plains Energy common stock and the future business and financial results of Great Plains Energy.\nCompletion of the anticipated merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the anticipated merger by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied. If the anticipated merger is not completed, or if there are significant delays in completing the anticipated merger, it could negatively affect the trading price of Great Plains Energy common stock and its future business and financial results, and Great Plains Energy will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nGreat Plains Energy may be liable for damages to Westar under the terms and conditions of the Amended Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nnegative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of Great Plains Energy common stock due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the anticipated merger will be completed; and\n\u2022\nhaving to pay certain significant costs relating to the anticipated merger, including, in certain circumstances, a termination fee.\nFailure to successfully combine the businesses of Great Plains Energy and Westar in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company, and, consequently, the value of the Holdco common stock that Great Plains Energy shareholders receive as the merger consideration.\nThe success of the anticipated merger will depend, in part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits and efficiencies from combining the businesses of Great Plains Energy and Westar. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully combined. If the combined company is not able to achieve these objectives, or is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the transactions may not be realized fully or at all. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the anticipated merger. These integration difficulties could result in a decline in the market value of Holdco common stock and, consequently, result in a decline in the market value of the Holdco common stock that Great Plains Energy shareholders receive as part of the merger consideration and continue to hold following consummation of the anticipated merger.\nGreat Plains Energy will incur significant transaction and other merger-related costs in connection with the anticipated merger.\nGreat Plains Energy has incurred and expects to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the anticipated merger. Additional unanticipated costs may also be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Great Plains Energy and Westar. Any net benefit from the anticipated elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may not be achieved in the near term or at all. Transaction costs could have a material adverse impact on the results of Great Plains Energy, and the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits and efficiencies from the merger, or the incurrence of additional expenses, could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the combined company and its ability to pay dividends after closing. In turn, the current market value of Great Plains Energy common stock, or the future market value of Holdco common stock that Great Plains Energy shareholders receive as merger consideration, could be adversely impacted.\nThe market price of Holdco's common stock after the anticipated merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of Great Plains Energy or Westar currently.\nUpon completion of the anticipated merger, the businesses of the combined company will differ from those of Great Plains Energy and Westar prior to the anticipated merger in important respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Holdco's shares of common stock following the anticipated merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of Great Plains Energy and Westar.\nEach of Westar and Great Plains Energy and their respective subsidiaries has substantial amounts of indebtedness. Consequently, the combined company will have substantial indebtedness following the anticipated merger. As a result, it may be difficult for the combined company to pay or refinance its debts or take other actions, and the combined company may need to divert its cash flow from operations to debt service payments.\nThe combined company's debt service obligations with respect to this indebtedness could have an adverse impact on its earnings and cash flows for as long as the indebtedness is outstanding.\nThe combined company's indebtedness could also have important consequences to holders of Holdco common stock. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for the combined company to pay or refinance its debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any decrease in revenues could cause the combined company to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make its scheduled debt payments;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of the combined company's cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nresult in a downgrade in the rating of the combined company's indebtedness, which could limit its ability to borrow additional funds or increase the interest rates applicable to its indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nrequire that additional terms, conditions or covenants be placed on Holdco.\nBased upon current levels of operations, Holdco expects to be able to generate sufficient cash on a consolidated basis to make all of the principal and interest payments when such payments are due under the combined company's existing credit facilities, indentures and other instruments governing its outstanding indebtedness, but there can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to repay or refinance such borrowings and obligations.\nThe anticipated benefits of combining the companies may not be realized.\nGreat Plains Energy entered into the Amended Merger Agreement with the expectation that the anticipated merger would result in various benefits, including, among other things, increased operating efficiencies and future cost savings that cannot be quantified with certainty at this time. Although Great Plains Energy expects to achieve the anticipated benefits of the anticipated merger, achieving them is subject to a number of uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nwhether U.S. federal and state public utility, antitrust and other regulatory authorities whose approval is required to complete the anticipated merger impose conditions on the merger, which may have an adverse effect on the combined company, including its ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the two companies to combine certain of their operations or take advantage of expected growth opportunities;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ngeneral competitive factors in the marketplace; and\n\u2022\nhigher than expected costs required to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nNo assurance can be given that these benefits will be achieved or, if achieved, the timing of their achievement. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and decreases in the amount of expected revenues or net income of the combined company.\nThe anticipated merger may not be accretive to Great Plains Energy's earnings and may cause dilution to Great Plains Energy's earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Holdco common stock that Great Plains Energy's shareholders receive upon the consummation of the anticipated merger.\nGreat Plains Energy currently anticipates that the anticipated merger will be accretive to Great Plains Energy's forecasted earnings per share on a standalone basis. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, including with respect to the anticipated timing and amount of common stock repurchases following the closing of the merger, any of which may materially change. Great Plains Energy may encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs than it currently anticipates, may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or may be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or its ability to realize operational efficiencies. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in the combined company's earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the anticipated merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of Holdco common stock.\nThe anticipated merger will combine two companies that are currently affected by developments in the electric utility industry, including changes in regulation and increased competition. A failure to adapt to the changing regulatory environment after the anticipated merger could adversely affect the stability of the combined company's earnings and could result in the erosion of its market positions, revenues and profits.\nBecause Great Plains Energy, Westar and their respective subsidiaries are regulated in the U.S. at the federal level and in several states, the two companies have been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. After the anticipated merger, the combined company and/or its subsidiaries will be subject in the U.S. to extensive federal regulation as well as to state regulation in Missouri and Kansas. Each of these jurisdictions has implemented, is in the process of implementing or possibly will implement changes to the regulatory and legislative framework applicable to the electric utility industry. These changes could have a material adverse effect on the combined company.\nThe costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on the combined company. Moreover, potential legislative changes, regulatory changes or otherwise may create greater risks to the stability of utility earnings generally. If the combined company is not responsive to these changes, it could suffer erosion in market position, revenues and profits as competitors gain access to the service territories of its utility subsidiaries.\nThe price of Holdco common stock that Great Plains Energy's shareholders receive upon the consummation of the anticipated merger may experience volatility.\nFollowing the consummation of the anticipated merger, the price of Holdco common stock may be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect the price of Holdco common stock are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community, the ability of Holdco to implement its integration strategy and to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from the anticipated merger and speculation in the press or investment community about Holdco's financial condition or results of operations. General market conditions and U.S. economic factors and political events unrelated to the performance of Holdco may also affect its stock price. For these reasons, shareholders should not rely on recent trends in the price of Great Plains Energy common stock to predict the future price of Holdco's common stock or its financial results.\nUtility Regulatory Risks:\nComplex utility regulation could adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are subject to, or affected by, extensive federal and state utility regulation, including regulation by the MPSC, KCC, FERC, NRC, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and SPP. The Companies must address in their business planning and management of operations the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, RTOs, utility regulators and taxing authorities. Failure of the Companies to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner, new or changed laws, regulations, standards, interpretations or other legal requirements, deterioration of the Companies' relationship with regulators and increased compliance costs and potential non-compliance consequences may materially affect the Companies' results of operations, financial\nposition and cash flows. Additionally, regulators may impose burdensome restrictions and conditions on the Companies' transactions and ventures, rendering them less attractive from a financial or operational perspective. Certain of these risks are addressed in greater detail below.\nThe outcome of retail rate proceedings could have a material impact on the business and is largely outside the Companies' control.\nThe rates that KCP&L and GMO are allowed to charge their customers significantly influence the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These rates are subject to the determination, in large part, of governmental entities outside of the Companies' control, including the MPSC, KCC and FERC.\nThe utility rate-setting principle generally applicable to KCP&L and GMO is that rates should provide a reasonable opportunity to recover expenses and investments prudently incurred to provide utility service plus a reasonable return on such investments. Various expenses incurred by KCP&L and GMO have been excluded from rates by the MPSC and KCC in past rate cases as not being prudently incurred or not providing utility customer benefit, and there is a risk that certain expenses incurred in the future may not be recovered in rates. Third-parties often intervene in the utilities' rate cases and argue that certain costs have not been prudently incurred or are otherwise not recoverable in rates. The MPSC and KCC also have in the past and may in the future exclude from rates all or a portion of investments in various facilities as not being prudently incurred or not being useful in providing utility service.\nAs discussed in the \"Environmental Risks\" and \"Financial Risks\" sections below, the Companies' capital expenditures are substantial and there is a risk that a portion of the capital costs could be excluded from rates in future rate cases.\nThe Companies are also exposed to cost-recovery shortfalls due to the inherent \"regulatory lag\" in the rate-setting process, especially during periods of significant cost inflation or declining retail usage, as KCP&L's and GMO's utility rates are generally based on historical information and are not subject to adjustment between rate cases, other than principally for fuel, purchased power, transmission and property taxes for KCP&L in Kansas; fuel, purchased power, certain transmission costs and demand-side investments for KCP&L in Missouri; and fuel, purchased power, certain transmission costs, demand-side investments and renewable energy (solar rebates) for GMO. These and other factors may result in under-recovery of costs, failure to earn the authorized return on investment, or both.\nFailure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects, the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances, regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings, reduced access to capital markets, increased financing costs, lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements, or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures. In response to competitive, economic, political, legislative, public perception (including, but not limited to, the Companies' environmental reputation) and regulatory pressures, the Companies may be subject to rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, including phase-in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period of time for the benefit of customers.\nRegulatory requirements regarding utility operations may increase costs and may expose the Companies to compliance penalties or adverse rate consequences.\nThe FERC, NERC and SPP have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability, cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities, including KCP&L and GMO. The MPSC and KCC have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements, such as vegetation management standards, facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards. In addition, the Companies are also subject to health, safety and other requirements enacted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and other federal and state agencies. As discussed more fully under \"Operational Risks,\" the NRC extensively regulates nuclear power plants, including Wolf Creek. The costs of existing, new or modified regulations, standards and other requirements could have an adverse effect on the\nCompanies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows as a result of increased operations or maintenance and capital expenditures for new facilities or to repair or improve existing facilities. In addition, failure to meet quality of service, reliability, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, operational or other standards and requirements could expose the Companies to penalties, additional compliance costs, or adverse rate consequences.\nEnvironmental Risks:\nThe Companies are subject to current and potential environmental requirements and the incurrence of environmental liabilities, any or all of which may adversely affect their business and financial results.\nThe Companies are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and disposal, natural resources and health and safety. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and remediation costs for historical and pre-existing conditions, these laws, regulations and permits authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. There is also a risk that new environmental laws and regulations, new administrative or judicial interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, or the requirements in new or renewed environmental permits could adversely affect the Companies' operations. In addition, there is also a risk of lawsuits brought by third parties alleging violations of environmental commitments or requirements, claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters, and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other damages. Certain federal courts have held that state and local governments and private parties have standing to bring climate change tort suits seeking company-specific emission reductions and damages.\nEnvironmental permits are subject to periodic renewal, which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits. New facilities, or modifications of existing facilities, may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits. Delays in the environmental permitting process, public opposition and challenges, denials of permit applications, limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects, and thus materially adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nKCP&L and GMO periodically seek recovery of capital costs and expenses for environmental compliance and remediation through rate increases; however, there can be no assurance that recovery of these costs would be granted. KCP&L and GMO may be subject to material adverse rate treatment in response to competitive, economic, political, legislative or regulatory pressures and/or public perception of the Companies' environmental reputation. The costs of compliance or noncompliance with environmental requirements, remediation costs, adverse outcomes of lawsuits, or failure to timely recover environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of these matters are discussed in more detail below. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding certain significant environmental matters and Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's current estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations.\nAir and Climate Change\nThe Companies' current generation capacity is primarily coal-fired, and is estimated to produce about one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) per MWh, or approximately 17 million tons and 13 million tons of CO2 per year for Great Plains Energy and KCP&L, respectively. Management believes it is possible that additional federal or relevant state or local laws or regulations could be enacted to address global climate change. At the international level, the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 by nearly 200 countries and became effective in November 2016. The Paris Agreement does not result in any new, legally binding obligations on the U.S. to meet a particular greenhouse gas emissions target, but establishes a framework for international cooperation on climate change. In June 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Under the rules of the Paris Agreement, the earliest any country can withdraw is November 2020. Other international agreements legally binding on the U.S. may be reached in the future. Greenhouse gas legislation has the potential of having significant financial and operational impacts on Great Plains Energy and KCP&L; however, the ultimate financial and operational consequences to Great Plains Energy and KCP&L cannot be determined until such legislation is passed. In\nthe absence of new Congressional mandates, the EPA is proceeding with regulation of greenhouse gases under the existing Clean Air Act.\nIn August 2015, the EPA finalized CO2 emission standards for new, modified and reconstructed affected fossil-fuel-fired electric utility generating units. The standards would not apply to Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's existing units unless the units were modified or reconstructed in the future. Also in August 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan which sets CO2 emission performance rates for existing affected fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. Nationwide, by 2030, the EPA projects the Clean Power Plan would achieve CO2 emission reductions from the power sector of approximately 32% from CO2 emission levels in 2005.\nIn February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan putting the rule on hold pending review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and any subsequent review by the U.S. Supreme Court if such review is sought. In October 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan on the basis that it exceeded the EPA's statutory authority. In December 2017, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit comments as the agency considers proposing a future rule to replace the Clean Power Plan. In the ANPRM, the EPA is considering proposing emission guidelines to limit greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric utility generating units. Compliance with the Clean Power Plan or any replacement rule has the potential of having significant financial and operational impacts on Great Plains Energy and KCP&L; however, the ultimate financial and operational consequences to Great Plains Energy and KCP&L cannot be determined until the outcome of the EPA's proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan and pending litigation is known.\nWater\nThe Clean Water Act and associated regulations enacted by the EPA form a comprehensive program to restore and preserve water quality. All of the Companies' generating facilities, and certain of their other facilities, are subject to the Clean Water Act.\nIn May 2014, the EPA finalized regulations pursuant to Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regarding cooling water intake structures pursuant to a court approved settlement. KCP&L generation facilities with cooling water intake structures are subject to the best technology available standards based on studies completed to comply with such standards. The rule provides flexibility to work with the states to develop the best technology available to minimize aquatic species impacted by being pinned against intake screens (impingement) or drawn into cooling water systems (entrainment).\nKCP&L holds a permit from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) covering water discharge from its Hawthorn Station. The permit authorizes KCP&L to, among other things, withdraw water from the Missouri River for cooling purposes and return the heated water to the Missouri River. KCP&L has applied for a renewal of this permit and the EPA has submitted an interim objection letter regarding the allowable amount of heat that can be contained in the returned water. Until this matter is resolved, KCP&L continues to operate under its current permit. Great Plains Energy and KCP&L cannot predict the outcome of this matter; however, while less significant outcomes are possible, this matter may require a reduction in generation, installation of cooling towers or other technology to cool the water, or both, any of which could have a significant impact on Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFurther, the possible effects of climate change, including potentially increased temperatures and reduced precipitation, could make it more difficult and costly to comply with the current and final permit requirements.\nSolid Waste\nSolid and hazardous waste generation, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal are regulated at the federal and state levels under various laws and regulations. In April 2015, the EPA published final regulations to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct (RCRA) Subtitle D to address the risks from the disposal of CCRs generated from the combustion of coal at electric generating facilities. In September 2017, the EPA granted industry petitions to reconsider certain provisions of the CCR rule. The Companies use coal in generating electricity and dispose of CCRs in both on-site facilities and facilities owned by third parties. Current and future EPA and state regulations regarding the handling, disposal and remediation of CCRs could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRemediation\nUnder current law, the Companies are also generally responsible for any liabilities associated with the environmental condition of their properties and other properties at which the Companies arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, including properties that they have previously owned or operated, such as manufactured gas plants (MGP), regardless of whether they were responsible for the contamination or whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time they owned or operated the properties or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances.\nDue to all of the above, the Companies' projected capital and other expenditures for environmental compliance are subject to significant uncertainties, including the timing of implementation of any new or modified environmental requirements, the limits imposed by such requirements and the types and costs of the compliance alternatives selected by the Companies. As a result, costs to comply with environmental requirements cannot be estimated with certainty, and actual costs could be significantly higher than projections. New environmental laws and regulations affecting the operations of the Companies may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the Companies or their facilities, any of which may materially adversely affect the Companies' business, adversely affect the Companies' ability to continue operating its power plants as currently done and substantially increase environmental expenditures or liabilities in the future.\nFinancial Risks:\nFinancial market disruptions and declines in credit ratings may increase financing costs and/or limit access to the credit markets, which may adversely affect liquidity and results.\nThe Companies rely on access to short-term money markets, revolving credit facilities provided by financial institutions and long-term capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations. The Companies also rely on bank-provided credit facilities for credit support, such as letters of credit, to support operations. The amount of credit support required for operations varies and is impacted by a number of factors.\nGreat Plains Energy, KCP&L, GMO and certain of their securities are rated by Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings. These ratings impact the Companies' cost of funds and Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. The interest rates on borrowings under the Companies' revolving credit agreements are subject to increase as their respective credit ratings decrease. The amount of collateral or other credit support required under power supply and certain other agreements is also dependent on credit ratings.\nConditions in the U.S. capital and credit markets may deteriorate in the future for a variety of reasons, including, among others: instability in global markets, political uncertainty in the U.S. or abroad, fluctuations in the price of oil, geopolitical instability or other unforeseen events both in the U.S. and around the world. Adverse market conditions or decreases in Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's or GMO's credit ratings could have material adverse effects on the Companies. These effects could include, among others: reduced access to capital and increased cost of funds; dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices; changes in the type and/or increases in the amount of collateral or other credit support obligations required to be posted with contractual counterparties; increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan funding requirements; rate case disallowance of KCP&L's or GMO's costs of capital; reductions in or delays of capital expenditures; or reductions in Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. Any of these results could adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on the Companies' lenders, suppliers and other counterparties or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations.\nGreat Plains Energy has guaranteed some of GMO's long-term and short-term debt and payments under these guarantees may adversely affect Great Plains Energy's liquidity.\nGreat Plains Energy has issued guarantees covering $95.5 million of GMO's long-term debt. Great Plains Energy also guarantees GMO's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2017, GMO had $209.3 million of commercial paper outstanding. The guarantees obligate Great Plains Energy to pay amounts owed by GMO directly to the holders of the guaranteed debt in the event GMO defaults on its payment obligations. Great Plains Energy may also guarantee debt that GMO may issue in the future. Any guarantee payments could adversely affect Great Plains Energy's liquidity.\nThe inability of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries to provide sufficient dividends to Great Plains Energy, or the inability otherwise of Great Plains Energy to pay dividends to its shareholders and meet its financial obligations would have an adverse effect.\nGreat Plains Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, particularly KCP&L and GMO. The ability of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions, and accordingly, Great Plains Energy's ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries, as well as regulatory factors, financial covenants, general business conditions and other matters.\nIn addition, Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends. Great Plains Energy's articles of incorporation restrict the payment of common stock dividends in the event common equity is 25% or less of total capitalization. Under the Federal Power Act, KCP&L and GMO generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings. The revolving credit agreements of Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO and the note purchase agreement for GMO's Series A, B and C Senior Notes contain a covenant requiring each company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00 at all times. Under the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy is also restricted from paying a quarterly common stock dividend in excess of $0.275 per share without the consent of Westar. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The Great Plains Energy Board of Directors (Great Plains Energy Board) regularly evaluates the common stock dividend policy and determines an appropriate dividend each quarter, after taking into account such factors as, among other things, earnings, financial condition and cash flows from KCP&L and GMO, as well as general economic conditions. Great Plains Energy cannot assure common shareholders that the dividend will be paid in the future or that, if paid, dividends will be at the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past.\nMarket performance, increased employee retirements and retirement plan regulations could significantly impact retirement plan funding requirements and associated cash needs and expenses.\nSubstantially all of the Companies' and WCNOC's employees participate in defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement plans. Former employees also have accrued benefits in defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement plans. The costs of these plans depend on a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of the provided benefits, discount rates, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, changes in benefit design, changes in laws or regulations, and the Companies' required or voluntary contributions to the plans. The Companies currently have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans. Also, if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels, or if these plans experience adverse market returns on investments, or if interest rates materially fall, the Companies' contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels. In addition, changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, could have a significant impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. Losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, if a counterparty fails to perform, or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to\nhedge fail to materialize. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nAs a service provider to GMO, KCP&L may have exposure to GMO's financial performance and operations.\nGMO has no employees of its own. KCP&L employees operate and manage GMO's properties, and KCP&L charges GMO for the cost of these services. These arrangements may pose risks to KCP&L, including possible claims arising from actions of KCP&L employees in operating GMO's properties and providing other services to GMO. KCP&L's claims for reimbursement for services provided to GMO are unsecured and rank equally with other unsecured obligations of GMO. KCP&L's ability to be reimbursed for the costs incurred for the benefit of GMO depends on the financial ability of GMO to make such payments.\nCustomer and Weather-Related Risks:\nThe results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Companies can be materially affected by changes in customer electricity consumption.\nChanges in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions, downturns or sluggishness in the economy, technological advances, energy efficiency or other factors may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nTechnological advances, energy efficiency, or other energy conservation measures could reduce customer electricity consumption. KCP&L and GMO generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce electricity, including microturbines, wind turbines, fuel cells and solar cells, that have recently become more cost competitive. If this trend continues, the Companies' customer electricity consumption could be reduced. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which the Companies' customers purchase or use electricity, which could reduce the Companies' customer electricity consumption.\nWeather is a major driver of the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Great Plains Energy and KCP&L are significantly impacted by seasonality, with approximately one-third of their retail electric revenues recorded in the third quarter. Unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales. In addition, severe weather, including but not limited to tornados, snow, rain, flooding and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses, lower revenues and additional capital restoration costs. KCP&L's and GMO's rates may not always be adjusted timely and adequately to reflect these increased costs. Some of the Companies' generating stations utilize water from the Missouri River for cooling purposes. Low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations and, if these levels were to get low enough, could require modifications to plant operations. The possible effects of climate change (such as increased temperatures, increased occurrence of severe weather or reduced precipitation, among other possible results) could potentially increase the volatility of demand and prices for energy commodities, increase the frequency and impact of severe weather, increase the frequency of flooding or decrease water and flow levels. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase the Companies' cost in providing service.\nOperational Risks:\nOperational risks may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe operation of the Companies' electric generation, transmission, distribution and information systems involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, aging infrastructure, processes and personnel performance; problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages; limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental, safety or other regulatory requirements; fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions; labor disputes; difficulties with the implementation or continued operation of information systems; transmission scheduling constraints; and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, droughts, explosions, terrorism, cyber threats, severe weather or other similar occurrences. Furthermore, to the extent that a cyber attack was successful, customer and employee information may be stolen, equipment may be destroyed or damaged and operations may be disrupted. Any such equipment or system outage or constraint can, among other things:\n\u2022\nin the case of generation equipment, affect operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, increase purchased power volumes and costs and reduce wholesale sales opportunities;\n\u2022\nin the case of transmission equipment, affect operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, require changes in the source of generation and affect wholesale sales opportunities and the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements;\n\u2022\nin the case of distribution systems, affect revenues and operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics and customer expectations; and\n\u2022\nin the case of information systems, affect the control and operations of generation, transmission, distribution, customer information and other business operations and processes, increase operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, and affect the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements and customer expectations.\nWith the exception of Hawthorn No. 5, which was substantially rebuilt in 2001, and Iatan No. 2, which was completed in 2010, all of KCP&L's and GMO's coal-fired generating units and its nuclear generating unit were constructed prior to 1986. The age of these generating units increases the risk of unplanned outages, reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense. Training, preventive maintenance and other programs have been implemented, but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns or failures of the Companies' generation facilities or increased maintenance expense. Furthermore, aging transmission and distribution facilities are more prone to failure than new facilities, which results in higher maintenance expense and the need to replace these facilities with new infrastructure. The higher maintenance costs and capital expenditures for new replacement infrastructure could cause additional rate volatility for the Companies' customers, resistance by the Companies' regulators to allow customer rate increases and/or regulatory lag.\nThe Companies currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover their facilities in amounts that management considers appropriate. These policies, however, do not cover the Companies' transmission or distribution systems, and the cost of repairing damage to these systems may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of the Companies' facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage.\nThese and other operating events may reduce the Companies' revenues, increase their costs, or both, and may materially affect their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCyber attacks and other disruptions to facilities could interfere with operations, expose the Companies, customers or employees to a risk of loss and could cause reputational and financial harm.\nElectric utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure, like KCP&L and GMO, may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. The Companies' facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of any such cyber attacks. The Companies' business relies on information technology for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, their primary business, as well as in secondary operational functions, including supply chain, and invoicing and collecting payments from customers. In the ordinary course of business, the Companies collect, store and transmit sensitive data including operating information, proprietary business information belonging to the Companies and third parties and personal information belonging to customers and employees. To the extent that a cyber attack was successful, customer and employee information may be stolen, equipment may be destroyed or damaged and operations of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system may be disrupted. In such an event, the Companies may experience substantial loss of revenues, material response costs and other financial loss, including the increased cost of insurance coverage. The Companies could also be subject to litigation, increased regulation and reputational damage. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are subject to information security risks and risks of unauthorized access to their systems.\nIn the course of their businesses, the Companies handle a range of system security and sensitive customer information. KCP&L and GMO are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of the utilities' information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, including confidential customer information or system operating information, could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Companies.\nKCP&L and GMO operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructures. Despite implementation of security measures, the technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, employee error or malfeasance, or unauthorized access. Such failures or breaches of the systems could impact the reliability of generation, transmission and distribution systems, result in legal claims and proceedings, damage the Companies' reputation and also subject the Companies to financial harm. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and not able to be recovered in a timely manner, critical business functions could be impaired and sensitive confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved.\nGreat Plains Energy's and KCP&L's businesses are capital intensive. The Companies currently have significant capital projects pending and may also have significant capital projects in the future. The risks of any capital project include: that actual costs may exceed estimated costs due to inflation or other factors; risks associated with the incurrence of additional debt or the issuance of additional equity to fund such projects; delays that may occur in obtaining permits and materials; the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts; inadequate availability or increased cost of equipment, materials or qualified craft labor; delays related to inclement weather; the scope, cost and timing of projects may change due to new or changed environmental requirements, health and safety laws or other factors; and other events beyond the Companies' control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects.\nThese and other risks could materially increase the estimated costs of capital projects, delay the in-service dates of projects, adversely affect the performance of the projects, and/or require the Companies to purchase additional electricity to supply their respective retail customers until the projects are completed. Thus, these risks may significantly affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFailure of one or more generation plant co-owners to pay their share of construction or operations and maintenance costs could increase the Companies' costs and capital requirements.\nKCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek, 50% of La Cygne Station, 70% of Iatan No. 1 and 55% of Iatan No. 2. GMO owns 18% of both Iatan units and 8% of Jeffrey Energy Center. The remaining portions of these facilities are owned by other utilities that are contractually obligated to pay their proportionate share of capital and other costs.\nWhile the ownership agreements provide that a defaulting co-owner's share of the electricity generated can be sold by the non-defaulting co-owners, there is no assurance that the revenues received will recover the increased costs borne by the non-defaulting co-owners. Occurrence of these or other events could materially increase the Companies' costs and capital requirements.\nKCP&L is exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, which could result in an adverse effect on the Companies' business and financial results.\nKCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including Wolf Creek. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down the facilities, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Additionally, the non-compliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry as a whole. Any revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could result in substantial capital expenditures at Wolf Creek.\nWolf Creek has the lowest fuel cost per MWh of any of KCP&L's generating units, excluding renewable generation. An extended outage of Wolf Creek, whether resulting from NRC action, an incident at the plant or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on KCP&L's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the event KCP&L incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates or insurance. If a long-term outage occurred, the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the Wolf Creek investment from rate base. Wolf Creek was constructed prior to 1986 and the age of Wolf Creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs.\nOwnership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes KCP&L to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit's life. KCP&L contributes annually based on estimated decommissioning costs to a tax-qualified trust fund to be used to decommission Wolf Creek. The funding level assumes a projected level of return on trust assets. If the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated, KCP&L could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates.\nKCP&L is also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, including, but not limited to, (i) potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit, (ii) the storage, handling, disposal and potential release (by accident, through third-party actions or otherwise) of radioactive materials and (iii) uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate. Under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units, KCP&L is also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments (subject to a cap) per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage.\nOn March 29, 2017, Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC (Westinghouse) filed voluntary petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Wolf Creek contracts with Westinghouse for nuclear fuel fabrications and reactor services. Westinghouse has stated that it intends to continue normal business operations. However, if Westinghouse did not perform under its contracts with Wolf Creek it could result in an extended outage at Wolf Creek. An extended outage of Wolf Creek could have a material adverse effect on Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the event KCP&L incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates. In January 2018, Westinghouse issued a news release stating that it would sell its global business to an unaffiliated third party. This transaction must be approved by the bankruptcy court and applicable regulators. The process has not yet begun, but Westinghouse stated it plans to close\nthe transaction in the third quarter of 2018. It is not yet known at this time if Wolf Creek's contracts will be impacted.\nThe structure of the regional power market in which the Companies operate could have an adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn March 2014, the SPP launched its Integrated Marketplace. Similar to other RTO or ISO markets, this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. In the event that KCP&L's and GMO's generating units are not among the lowest cost generating units operating within the market, KCP&L and GMO could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales.\nA market for Transmission Congestion Rights (TCR) is also included as part of the Integrated Marketplace. TCRs are financial instruments used to hedge transmission congestion charges. Both KCP&L and GMO acquire TCRs for the purpose of hedging against transmission congestion charges. There is a risk that KCP&L and GMO could incorrectly model the amount of TCRs needed, or that the TCRs acquired could be ineffective in hedging against transmission congestion charges which could lead to increased purchased power costs.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may change from time to time and such changes could impact the Companies' costs and revenues. Because the manner in which RTOs or ISOs will evolve is unclear, the Companies are unable to assess fully the impact of these changes.\nLitigation Risks:\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted. An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are party to various material litigation and regulatory matters arising out of their business operations. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Companies may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters.", "PERMNO": 24432, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "GXP"}
