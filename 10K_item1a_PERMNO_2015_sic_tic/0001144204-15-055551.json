{"cik": "1422892", "company": "Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not have sufficient liquidity to execute our business plan or to continue our operations without obtaining additional funding or selling additional securities. We may not be able to obtain additional funding under commercially reasonable terms or issue additional securities.\nWe reported net income attributable to Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. of approximately $0.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, compared to approximately $1.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $2.6 million.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had $0.7 million in cash or cash equivalents. Our management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity in fiscal year 2016 to finance our anticipated operations, as well as achieve projected cash collections from customers and contain expenses and cash used in operations. Additionally, we may enter into new business segments through selected merger and acquisitions that may require us to obtain additional funding or issue additional securities. Changes in our business conditions or the financial markets could limit our access to existing credit facilities or make new sources of financing more costly or commercially unviable. Changes in China\u2019s currency exchange control regulations could also limit our ability to access cash outside of China to meet liquidity requirements for our planned operations or intended acquisitions in China.\nWe have historically relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and no longer provide shipping agency services to our former largest customer.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we commenced providing shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to a single customer, the Zhiyuan Investment Group, an entity controlled by Mr. Zhang, our largest shareholder. During fiscal year 2014, $4,120,409 (or 35.4%), of our net revenues and $2,517,008 (or 62.4%), of our gross profits came from providing shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we have not provided shipping and chartering services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group. The nature of our business is driven by the needs of our clients, and we cannot predict when, or if ever, we will receive another order for shipping and chartering services from the Zhiyuan Investment Group. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, $0 of our net revenues and $2,545,009 (or 22.5%) of our net revenues, respectively, resulted from providing shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group, as compared to $1,937,196 (or 16.6%) of our net revenues and $2,183,213 (or 18.7%) of our net revenues, respectively, came from providing the same services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, $0 of our gross profit and $2,143,606 (or 39.8%) of our gross profit, respectively, came from providing shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group as compared to $646,148 (or 16.0% of our gross profit) and $1,870,860 (or 46.4% of our gross profit), respectively, came from providing the same services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. If we do not provide shipping and chartering services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group in the future, our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Further, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to replace this customer with one or more new customers of similar size. Prior to fiscal year 2014, we relied heavily on Beijing Shourong Forwarding Service, Co., Ltd. (\u201cShourong\u201d), an affiliate of Capital Steel, a steel company in China, for a substantial percentage of our shipping agency business. As part of the restructuring of our business, we exited our non-performing service arrangements including our shipping agency service with Shourong, who in fiscal year 2013, accounted for approximately 63% of our total net revenues. We did not provide any shipping agency services to Shourong in fiscal year 2014 or during fiscal year 2015 and cannot determine the extent of services, if any, we will deliver to Shourong in the future. In fiscal year 2015, we commenced providing inland transportation management services to a third-party customer Tengda. For the year ended June 30, 2015, Tengda accounted for approximately 20% of the Company\u2019s total net revenues.\nWe have recently entered shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services businesses and cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively in these business areas.\nPrior to fiscal year 2014, our sole line of business was providing shipping agency services. We expanded our services to include shipping and chartering services in the quarter ended September 30, 2013 and inland transportation management services in the quarter ended December 31, 2013. As we are a new entrant into these two business lines, we do not have a significant market presence. Currently, we only provide inland transportation services to two customers: the Zhiyuan Investment Group and Tengda. We may not have been able to enter into these business lines without our relationship with Mr. Zhang, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in securing and providing shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services contracts for other customers on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe fees that we received from the Zhiyuan Investment Group for our shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services may not be indicative of the fees that we may receive for the same services provided to unaffiliated customers and may be materially lower, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that the fees we have received from the Zhiyuan Investment Group for our shipping and chartering and inland transportation management services are indicative of the fees that we may receive if we are able to obtain non-affiliated customers for these services. The fees that we may receive from non-affiliated customers may be less than what we have received from our affiliated customer, and could possibly be so low as to make these lines of business unprofitable, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require us to terminate such service lines.\nWe have entered into a number of business arrangements that are significant to us with two of our shareholders including Mr. Zhang, our largest shareholder, and through Mr. Zhang, the Zhiyuan Investment Group, who is controlled by Mr. Zhang. The failure to maintain our business relationship with either or both of such shareholders would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn April 2013, as approved by our Board of Directors and shareholders, Mr. Zhang purchased 1,800,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $3 million, which as of the date of this report represents approximately 21.5% of our issued and outstanding common stock, resulting in Mr. Zhang becoming our largest shareholder. As a result of Mr. Zhang\u2019s desire to find business opportunities that would mutually benefit us and the Zhiyuan Investment Group, a company controlled by Mr. Zhang, which owns a number of businesses in China, in June 2013, we signed a 5-year Global Logistic Service Agreement with two parties, one of which was the Zhiyuan Investment Group and the other was TEWOO Chemical & Light Industry Zhiyuan Trade Co., Ltd. (\u201cTewoo\u201d). Thereafter, during the quarter ended September 30, 2013, we executed a shipping and chartering services agreement with the Zhiyuan Investment Group, pursuant to which we assisted the Zhiyuan Investment Group in the transportation of approximately 51,000 tons of chromite ore from South Africa to China; and in September 2013, we executed an inland transportation management service contract with the Zhiyuan Investment Group pursuant to which we agreed to provide certain advisory services and assist the Zhiyuan Investment Group in attempting to control its potential commodities loss during the transportation process. On a one time basis, we executed a one year short-term loan agreement with the Zhiyuan Investment Group, effective January 1, 2014, to facilitate the working capital needs of the Zhiyuan Investment Group. As of June 30, 2014, the net amount due to us from the Zhiyuan Investment Group was $2,920,950 consisting of funds borrowed from us pursuant to the short-term loan agreement and trade receivables due us from the Zhiyuan Investment Group. In September 2014, we collected approximately $2.7 million from the Zhiyuan Investment Group, representing full repayment of all funds borrowed by the Zhiyuan Investment Group from us pursuant to the short-term loan agreement and the payment to us of approximately $1.6 million of outstanding trade receivables. In October 2014, we collected approximately $384,000 from the Zhiyuan Investment Group to reduce the outstanding trade receivables due to us from the Zhiyuan Investment Group. During fiscal year 2015, we continued to provide inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group. The net amount due to us from the Zhiyuan Investment Group at June 30, 2015 was approximately $2.6 million of trade receivables.\nIn May 2014, we signed a strategic agreement with Qingdao Zhenghe Shipping Group Limited (\u201cZhenghe\u201d), to jointly explore mutually beneficial business development opportunities. Zhenghe is a PRC company which Mr. Deming Wang is the majority shareholder of. To demonstrate the commitment by Zhenghe to its business relationship with us, in June 2014, as approved by our Board of Directors, Mr. Wang, through a company owned by him, purchased 200,000 shares of our common stock for $444,000, resulting in Mr. Wang owning as of the date of this report, approximately 2.3% of our outstanding common stock. In September 2014, as approved by our Board of Directors, we acquired LSM, a ship management company based in Hong Kong from Mr. Wang. For the period commencing on September 8, 2014, the completion date of our acquisition of LSM, through June 30, 2015, LSM generated net revenues of $190,088, and all such net revenues were generated solely from providing ship management services to seven vessels, which ship management services we outsourced to an entity controlled by Mr. Wang.\nAs a result of our business relationship with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang, since April 2013, we have received approximately $3.5 million from the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to such two persons and added shipping and chartering, inland transportation management and ship management services to our service platform. Such shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services generated approximately 35% and 62% of our net revenues and gross profit in fiscal year 2014, respectively, approximately 42% and 75% of our net revenues and gross profit, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2015 (of which approximately 23% and 40%, respectively, were attributable to our business relationships with Messrs. Zhang and Wang, and the remaining 19% and 35% , respectively, were attributable to us providing inland transportation services to Tengda a new client which we commenced providing such services to in July 2014).\nBased upon the above, the failure by us to maintain our existing business relationship with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe shipping agency business is very competitive in nature and many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have.\nOur competitors in the shipping agency business include three major shipping agencies, China Ocean Shipping Agency Co., Ltd. (\u201cPenavico\u201d), China Shipping (Group) Company (\u201cChina Shipping\u201d) and China Marine Shipping Agency Co., Ltd. (\u201cSinoagent\u201d). These competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and name recognition than we have. In addition, we also face competition from a large number of smaller, local shipping agents. Our competitors may introduce new business models, and if these new business models are more attractive to customers than the business models we currently use, our customers may switch to our competitors\u2019 services, and we may lose market share. We believe that competition in China\u2019s shipping agency industry may become more intense as more shipping agencies, including Chinese/foreign joint ventures, are qualified to conduct business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any new or existing competitors, or against any new business models our competitors may implement. In addition, the increased competition we anticipate in the shipping agent industry may also reduce the number of vessels for which we are able to provide shipping agency services, or cause us to reduce agency fees in order to attract or retain customers. All of these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur three largest shipping agency competitors, Penavico, China Shipping and Sinoagent, are partly owned by the Chinese government which places us at a significant competitive disadvantage.\nThe Chinese government\u2019s ownership interests in Penavico, China Shipping and Sinoagent, place us at a significant competitive disadvantage. When the Chinese government founded Penavico, it closed the shipping agency industry to a number of foreign shipping agents that had been providing services in China. These restrictions have since been removed, but there can be no assurance that the Chinese government will not reinstate these restrictions or impose other restrictions, or nationalize the shipping agency industry in the future. Further, we believe that state ownership provides Penavico, China Shipping and Sinoagent, with advantages and leverage over local government officials and local companies that we, as a non-state owned company, do not have. Also, due to their relationship with the Chinese government, these competitors may have access to funding that is not available to us. This access may allow them to grow their businesses at a rate we are not able to match. If the Chinese government were to take actions to limit competition or provide these competitors with preferential access to business and funding, which results in our losing business, it would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that our competitors in the shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services business, have greater name recognition, significantly more experience, financial, marketing and other resources than we have and we expect to face intense competition in these business segments.\nWe have recently launched the shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services business and so we expect that our competitors in these segments will have greater experience and name recognition than we do, which is a competitive disadvantage to us. Further, we expect that these competitors will be larger than us and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have, which also puts us at a significant competitive disadvantage. Since larger competitors may be able to offer the same services we offer at lower rates than what we would need to charge to operate profitably, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nThe barriers to enter into the business segments in which we operate are low and we may face competition from new entrants into these business segments.\nThe number of competitors offering the same services that we do may increase in the future since the barriers to entry are low. Increases in competition could lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers are engaged in the shipping industry, and, consequently, our financial performance is dependent upon the economic conditions of that industry.\nWe derive our revenues from providing services to customers in the business of shipping materials to China and our success is dependent upon our customer\u2019s shipping needs. Our customers\u2019 shipping needs are intrinsically linked to economic conditions in the shipping industry in general and trade with China in particular. The shipping industry, in turn, is subject to intense competitive pressures and is affected by overall economic conditions. Accordingly, demand for our services could be harmed by instability or downturns in the shipping industry, reductions in trade between China and other countries or a combination of both which could materially lower demand or cause our customers to forego the shipping agency services we provide by attempting to provide such services in-house. If any of the foregoing occurs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nWe may be required to assume liabilities for our clients in the future.\nAn increasing number of companies that require shipping agency services have pressured shipping agents to guarantee their clients\u2019 liabilities. Some companies have required shipping agents, as a condition of doing business, to pay for tariffs, port charges, and other fees, or to pay these fees with the promise of reimbursement at a later date. Other companies have sought to include shipping agents as parties in voyage charter agreements, leading to potential liability for shipping agents in the event of a breach by another party. We expect that these pressures on shipping agents to accept more liability will increase as competition among shipping agencies intensifies. While we do not currently pay these liabilities and have no present intention to begin doing so in the future, the assumption of any of these or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the services of experienced personnel who possess skills that are valuable in our industry, and we may have to actively compete for their services.\nWe are a small company with limited resources, and we compete in large part on the basis of the quality of services we are able to provide our clients. As a result, we are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled personnel to serve our clients. Many of our personnel possess skills that would be valuable to other companies engaged in one or more of our business lines. Consequently, we expect that we will have to actively compete with other Chinese shipping agencies to retain these employees. Some of our competitors may be able to pay our employees more than we are able to pay to retain them. Our ability to profitably operate is substantially dependent upon our ability to locate, hire, train and retain our personnel. Although we have not experienced difficulty locating, hiring, training or retaining our employees to date, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel, or that we will be able to attract and assimilate other qualified personnel in the future. If we are unable to effectively obtain and maintain skilled personnel, the quality of the shipping services that we provide could be materially impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are substantially dependent upon our key personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. In particular, the services of:\n\u2022 Mr. Lei Cao, Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022 Mr. Anthony S. Chan, Executive Vice President and Acting Chief Financial Officer; and\n\u2022 Mr. Zhikang Huang, Chief Operating Officer\nwould be difficult for us to replace. While we have employment contracts with each of our executive officers, such contracts may be terminated in certain circumstances by the executive officers. Moreover, we do not have any \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could substantially impair our ability to effectively execute our business and expand our service platform, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe need to maintain our relationships with local shipping agents.\nOur shipping agency business is dependent upon our relationships with local agents operating in the ports where our customers ship their products. As a general agent, substantially all of our shipping agency revenues have been derived from services delivered by the local agents and we believe local agent relationships will remain critical to our success in the future. We have a number of local agents that account for a significant portion of our business, the loss of one or more of which could materially and negatively impact our ability to retain and service our customers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and expand our existing local agent relationships or enter into new local agent relationships, or that new or renewed local agent relationships will be available on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to maintain and expand our existing local agent relationships, renew existing local agent relationships, or enter into new local agent relationships, we may lose customers, customer introductions and co-marketing benefits, and our business and results of operations may suffer significantly.\nWe are dependent on third party carriers and inland transportation companies to transport our client\u2019s cargo.\nWe rely on commercial ocean freight carriers and inland transportation companies, for the movement of our client\u2019s cargo. Consequently, our ability to provide services for our clients could be adversely impacted by: shortages in available cargo capacity; changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling, pricing, payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel, taxes and labor; and other factors not within our control. Reductions in ocean freight capacity could negatively impact our yields. Material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation, whether caused by strike, work stoppage, lock-out, slowdown or otherwise, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to effectively manage our cost structure as we grow the business.\nAs we continue to attempt to increase our revenues through the expansion of our service offerings, we must maintain an appropriate cost structure to maintain and increase our profitability. While we intend to increase our revenues by increasing the number and quality of the shipping services we provide by strategic acquisitions, and by maintaining and expanding our gross profit margins by reducing costs, our profitability will be driven in large part by our ability to manage our agent commissions, personnel and general and administrative costs as a function of our net revenues. There can be no assurances that we will be able to effectively control our costs and failure to do so would result in lack of profitability, which would have a material adverse effect our business and results of operations.\nComparisons of our operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to fluctuate in the future because of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In fiscal year 2014 and 2015, a substantial portion of our revenues was derived from the Zhiyuan Investment Group whose business needs we believe are tied closely to economic trends and consumer demand that can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that our historic operating performance will continue in future periods as we cannot assume or provide any assurance that the Zhiyuan Investment Group will continue to utilize our services, or have the same level of demand for our services that it had in fiscal year 2014 and 2015. Because our quarterly revenues and operating results vary significantly, comparisons of our period-to-period results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.\nWe have not paid any dividends and we do not foresee paying dividends in the future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, if ever. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, Virginia and PRC laws, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nForeign Operational Risks\nWe do not have business liability or disruption insurance.\nWe do not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations. Any business interruption, litigation or natural disaster may result in our business incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations. The PRC government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to provide certain services. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment.\nIn the course of providing services for international shipments, we occasionally require currencies from other countries to conduct our business. While we believe that we have complied with applicable currency control laws and regulations in all material aspects, we cannot guarantee you that our efforts will be free from challenge or that, if challenged, we will be successful in our defense of our current practices. Under our current corporate structure, our income is paid in different currencies, depending on our agreements with individual customers. We then pay in local currencies the expenses associated with operating a company in several countries. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to pay such expenses unless and until we convert currencies that we have into those that we require.\nOne of the currencies we often convert among is the RMB. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends, if any, in foreign currencies to our shareholders.\nFluctuation in the value of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. We rely largely on payments from Trans Pacific and Sino-China. While we charge our fees in U.S. dollars, Sino-China and Trans Pacific nevertheless operate within China and will rely heavily on RMB in their operations. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our common stock in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes.\nChanges in China\u2019s political and economic policies could harm our business.\nChina\u2019s economy has historically been a planned economy subject to governmental plans and quotas and has, in certain aspects, been transitioning to a more market-oriented economy. Although we believe that the economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of China, we cannot predict the future direction of these economic reforms or the effects these measures may have on our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These differences include:\n\u2022 economic structure;\n\u2022 level of government involvement in the economy;\n\u2022 level of development;\n\u2022 level of capital reinvestment;\n\u2022 control of foreign exchange;\n\u2022 methods of allocating resources; and\n\u2022 balance of payments position.\nAs a result of these differences, our business may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy were similar to those of the OECD member countries.\nSince 1979, the Chinese government has promulgated many new laws and regulations covering general economic matters. Despite this activity to develop a legal system, China\u2019s system of laws is not yet complete. Even where adequate law exists in China, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain or sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China\u2019s judiciary, in many cases, creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Our activities in China will also be subject to administration review and approval by various national and local agencies of China\u2019s government. Because of the changes occurring in China\u2019s legal and regulatory structure, we may not be able to secure the requisite governmental approval for our activities. Although we have obtained all required governmental approval to operate our business as currently conducted, to the extent we are unable to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals, the Chinese government may, in its sole discretion, prohibit us from conducting our business.\u201d\nThe Chinese government could change its policies toward private enterprise or even nationalize or expropriate private enterprises, which could result in the total loss of our investment in that country.\nOur business is subject to significant political and economic uncertainties and may be adversely affected by political, economic and social developments in China. Over the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. The Chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time with little, if any, prior notice.\nChanges in policies, laws and regulations or in their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, restrictions or prohibitions on dividend payments to shareholders, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business. Nationalization or expropriation could even result in the total loss of our investment in China and in the total loss of your investment in us.\nAs some of our directors, officers and assets are outside the United States, it will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against us and our officers, directors and assets based in China.\nSome of our directors and officers reside outside the United States. In addition, many of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or officers and our subsidiaries, or enforce against any of them court judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments relating to United States federal securities laws. Furthermore, because the majority of our assets are located in China and PRC does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts, it would also be extremely difficult to access those assets to satisfy an award entered against us in United States court.\nOur international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. regulations.\nIn addition to the Chinese laws and regulations with which we must comply, we must also comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits U.S. companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties and/or restrictions in our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. As a result, we are restricted from entering into transactions with certain targeted foreign countries, entities, and individuals except as permitted by OFAC, which could reduce our future growth.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Vessel Acquisition\nWe may not close on the proposed acquisition of the Vessel.\nAlthough as an inducement for the Vessel Seller to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement and as partial payment of the purchase price for the Vessel, we issued to the Vessel Seller on April 10, 2015, 1.2 million shares of our common stock, the closing of the acquisition of the Vessel is subject to a number of closing conditions that must be satisfied by the Vessel Seller or waived by us, including, among other conditions, that we complete our inspection of the Vessel and are satisfied with the results thereof, the Vessel is in compliance with classification standards, the Vessel Seller delivers clean title to the Vessel, we secure debt financing on terms and conditions satisfactory to us and we elect to issue additional shares of our restricted common stock to the Vessel Seller as part of the remaining purchase price. Because no assurances can be given that all closing conditions to our acquisition of the Vessel will be satisfied by the Vessel Seller or waived by us, no assurances can be given that we will be able to acquire the Vessel. Although if we do not close on the Vessel acquisition, the Vessel Seller is obligated to pay to us $2.22 million, and, in June 2015, we obtained a lien on and security interest in the Vessel to provide us with a mechanism to assist us in obtaining such funds if we do not close on the acquisition of the Vessel, no assurances can be given that the Vessel Seller will be able to pay to us such amount and we have no right (nor does the Vessel Seller have any obligation to return to us) to a return of the 1.2 million shares.\nPossible increase in indebtedness if we acquire the Vessel; no assurances of revenue and/or cash flow from our use of the Vessel if we are able to acquire the Vessel.\nIn the event we acquire the Vessel, and we use debt to finance a portion of the purchase price whether from the Vessel Seller or loans from a bank or other lenders, the incurrence of any such indebtedness will increase our interest expense and financial leverage, which will result in less funds available for our other operations and general corporate purposes.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, we may be dependent on a limited number of customers for a large part of any of our revenues and cash flow generated from the Vessel, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations to us could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we acquire the Vessel and unless we were able to secure a time charter arrangement, a majority of our revenues from our use of the Vessel could be derived from charter voyage agreements entered into with a limited number of third party charterers. Such agreements subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of each of our third party charterers to perform their obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the maritime industry in China, the overall financial condition of the third party charterers, and charter rates that we may charge. The combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in world trade, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the ability of charterers to make charter payments to us. In addition, in depressed market conditions, charterers may no longer need a vessel that is then under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, any charterers for the Vessel that we are able to obtain may seek to renegotiate the terms of any charter agreements they enter into with us or avoid their obligations to us under those contracts. Should a third party charterer fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUsing acquisition debt will limit funds available for other purposes and impair our ability to react to changes in our business.\nIf we are able to acquire the Vessel and are able to obtain debt financing to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Vessel, we must dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on any such indebtedness. These payments limit funds otherwise available for our working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes. As of June 30, 2015, we had no indebtedness. Any material increase of our indebtedness as a result of the proposed Vessel acquisition, creates the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash flow sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of, any such acquisition indebtedness. Such debt could also have other significant consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion, if not all, of our cash flow from operations to payments on our such indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt or better access to capital;\n\u2022 limit our ability to raise additional financing debt and/or equity on satisfactory terms to us or at all; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to make investments, capital expenditures, redeem capital stock, acquire additional vessels, incur additional indebtedness or credit liens, or to change or terminate the management of the vessels;\nFailure to make payments when due or to comply with covenants contained in any financing documents could result in any lender (or the Vessel Seller if the Vessel Seller provides seller financing) accelerating payment of all such outstanding indebtedness and/or foreclosing on the Vessel and any other assets we pledge as collateral. Furthermore, our future interest expense could increase if interest rates increase. If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to refinance all or part of any such financing acquisition.\nWe have no direct experience in owning a transportation Vessel.\nAlthough our management team has substantial experience in the shipping industry, we, as a company, have never owned a vessel. As a result, even if we are able to acquire the Vessel, no assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully integrate this new line of business into our current operations and/or successfully operate or charter the Vessel in a manner that will result in sufficient revenues and cash flow being generated by our use of the Vessel to offset the associated expenses to be incurred by us in deploying the Vessel.\nNo assurances that if we acquire the Vessel, and the TCA expires by its terms or is terminated for any reason, that we will be able to obtain charterers or customers to charter the Vessel from us to transport such parties\u2019 oil and/or chemical products for such parties.\nPursuant to the TCA, we receive charter payments from the third-party charterer. In the event we acquire the Vessel, no assurances can be given that after such TCA expires, or is terminated by either party for any reason, we will be able to enter into other chartering agreements or, if so, the same or better than such TCA.\nAs a result, although we believe based upon our knowledge. business relationships in the shipping industry, that if we are able to acquire the Vessel we will be able to charter the Vessel to other third party charterers on terms comparable to the TCA and/or enter into agreements with customers to transport their oil and/or chemical products for using the Vessel. In the event we are unable to enter into any such arrangements or only into a limited number of arrangements, our operations and cash flow could be materially adversely affected as we would need to divert available cash flow from our other service lines to pay all or a portion of the expenses related to the Vessel including, but not limited to, interest and principal payments on acquisition debt we are able to obtain and use to acquire the Vessel.\nWe believe that the market for time and voyage charters is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources.\nIn the event that we are able to acquire the Vessel, we will be using the Vessel in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly fragmented. The operation and chartering of tanker vessels, as well as the shipping industry in general, is extremely competitive. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners, some of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. Competition for the transportation of oil and chemical products can be intense and depends on price, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its operators to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater resources could enter and operate fleets of ships through consolidations or acquisitions that may be able to offer better prices and fleets than us.\nIn the event that we are able to acquire the Vessel, we may be subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs a tanker vessel owner, operator and/or charterer (which would include chartering the Vessel to third parties) we may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, toxic tort claims, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of such business. Although depending on the claim, we would defend any such matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or the potential costs to resolve them may have a material adverse effect on us. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, we may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees in the tanker shipping industry, which may negatively impact the effectiveness of our management and our results of operations.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the abilities and efforts of our management team. While Mr. African Li, our Chief Technical Officer, has substantial experience in the management and operation of tanker vessels, there is no guarantee that we will be able to hire additional persons with the required experience in our industry if so needed. Our inability to hire and retain any such persons, if and when needed, could materially and adversely affect our then operations, business prospects, financial condition and our results of operations.\nAn increase in operating costs could decrease earnings and available cash.\nIf we acquire the Vessel and determine to operate it via voyage charters, we will incur operating costs including, but not limited to, the costs of crew, provisions, deck and engine stores, insurance and maintenance and repairs, which depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we acquire the Vessel, and if and when it suffers damages, it may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility. The costs of drydocking repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. Increases in any of these expenses could decrease our earnings and available cash.\nThe tanker industry is both cyclical and highly volatile and as a result, if we acquire the Vessel, this may lead to reductions and volatility in our charter rates.\nThe tanker industry in which we intend to operate if we acquire the Vessel, is cyclical with high volatility in charter rates, vessel values and industry profitability. For tanker vessels, the degree of charter rate volatility has varied widely. If we enter into a charter for our Vessel when charter rates are low, our revenues and earnings will be adversely affected. In addition, a decline in charter hire rates likely will cause the value of the Vessel to decline. Changes in charter rates would not only affect the revenues we will receive from the Vessel, but also affect the value of the Vessel, even if it is employed under long-term time charters. Our ability to charter the Vessel and the charter rates payable under any charters will depend upon, among other things, economic conditions in the tanker market. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in the supply and demand for tanker vessels. Factors affecting the supply and demand for tanker vessels are outside of our control and are unpredictable. The nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in tanker industry conditions are also unpredictable. Factors that influence the demand for tanker vessel capacity include:\n\u2022 supply and demand for oil and or chemical products;\n\u2022 global and regional economic and political conditions, including developments in international trade, fluctuations in regional production, and armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes;\n\u2022 environmental and other legal and regulatory developments;\n\u2022 weather, natural disasters and other acts of God, including hurricanes and typhoons;\n\u2022 competition from alternative modes of transportation; and\n\u2022 international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions, nationalizations, piracy and wars.\nThe factors that influence the supply of ocean-going vessel capacity include:\n\u2022 the number of newbuilding deliveries;\n\u2022 current and expected purchase orders for vessels;\n\u2022 the scrapping rate of older vessels;\n\u2022 vessel freight rates;\n\u2022 the price of steel and vessel equipment;\n\u2022 technological advances in the design and capacity of vessels;\n\u2022 potential conversion of vessels to alternative use;\n\u2022 vessel casualties;\n\u2022 changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful lives of vessels; and\n\u2022 the number of vessels that are out of service at a given time.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, we will become subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, our operations relating to the Vessel could subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and national and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the Vessel operates or is registered, which could significantly impact our business. Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful life of the Vessel (or any other vessels we acquire). We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. We may be required to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. Although insurance covers certain environmental risks, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all such risks or that any claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, we will become subject to international safety regulations and requirements imposed by classification societies and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, our use of the Vessel will be affected by the requirements set forth in the United Nations\u2019 International Maritime Organization\u2019s International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code. The ISM Code requires ship owners, ship managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive \u201cSafety Management System\u201d that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. We expect that the Vessel will be ISM Code-certified when delivered to us. The failure of a shipowner to comply with the ISM Code may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. In addition, the hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the Safety of Life at Sea Convention. If the Vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey or special survey, the Vessel will be unable to trade between ports and will be unemployable, which will negatively impact our revenues and results from operations.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, we may be exposed to various risks relating to climate changes.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries and the IMO have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures may include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, incentives or mandates for renewable energy, requirements for new fuel standards, limits on vessel speeds and local requirements for shore-side electrical power for vessels in port. In addition, although the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping currently are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a new treaty may be adopted in the future that includes restrictions on shipping emissions. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and obligations relating to climate change could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our vessels and require us to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities may also be adversely affected. Adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry relating to climate change, including growing public concern about the environmental impact of climate change, may also adversely affect demand for the Vessel. For example, increased regulation of greenhouse gases or other concerns relating to climate change may reduce the demand for oil and gas in the future or create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on our operations and results thereof resulting from or as a result of the Vessel that we cannot predict with certainty at this time.\nAn over-supply of tanker capacity may lead to reductions in charter hire rates and profitability.\nThe supply of tanker vessels generally increases with deliveries of the new tanker vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older tanker vessels. The market supply of tankers is affected by a number of factors such as demand for energy resources, oil and petroleum products, as well as strong overall economic growth in part of the world economy, including Asia. An over-supply of tanker capacity has already resulted in a reduction of charter hire rates. If further reduction occurs, we may be unable to find profitable charters, the Vessel and any vessels we acquire in the future. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nPurchasing and operating a previously owned vessel, like the Vessel, may result in increased operating costs which could adversely affect our earnings.\nThe acquisition of a previously owned vessel, such as the Vessel, may result in increased costs to us. While we intend to rigorously inspect the Vessel prior to acquiring it, we do not believe that this provides us with the same knowledge about their condition and cost of any required (or anticipated) repairs that we would have had if the Vessel had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Accordingly, we may not discover defects or other problems with the Vessel prior to purchase. Any such hidden defects or problems, when detected, may be expensive to repair, and if not detected, may result in accidents or other incidents for which we may become liable to third parties. Also, by purchasing a previously owned vessel, we may not receive the benefit of warranties from the builders because the Vessel is older than one year. Governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of the Vessel may require expenditures for alterations, or the addition of new equipment, to the Vessel and may restrict the type of activities in which the Vessel may engage.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, we will incur substantial costs relating to our obtaining and maintaining the required insurance relating to the Vessel and we will also be subject to certain risks related thereto.\nIf we acquire the Vessel, we intend to carry insurance for the Vessel against those types of risks commonly insured against by vessel owners and operators. These insurances include hull and machinery insurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage and war risk insurance. No assurances can be given that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for the Vessel now or at a future date. Moreover, the insurers may not pay particular claims, and we expect our insurance policies will contain deductibles for which we will be responsible as well as limitations and exclusions which may nevertheless increase our costs or lower our revenue.", "PERMNO": 92688, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "SINO"}
