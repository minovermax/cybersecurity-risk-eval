{"cik": "1609132", "company": "C1 Financial, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe geographic concentration of our markets makes our business highly susceptible to downturns in the local economies and depressed banking markets, which could be detrimental to our financial condition.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a banking franchise concentrated in the state of Florida. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 91% of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in Florida. Deterioration in local economic conditions in the loan market or in the commercial or industrial real estate market could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our portfolio by eroding the loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio, the demand for our products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In addition, if the population or income growth in the region is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and real estate development could be adversely affected and could result in the curtailment of our expansion, growth and profitability. If any of these developments were to result in losses that materially and adversely affected the Bank\u2019s capital, we might be subject to regulatory restrictions on operations and growth and to a requirement to raise additional capital.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain high. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets could significantly affect the ability of our customers to operate, the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses for our loans that we originated or acquired.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022 cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u2022 the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan;\n\u2022 the duration of the loan;\n\u2022 the discount on the loan at the time of acquisition, if acquired;\n\u2022 the credit history of a particular borrower; and\n\u2022 changes in economic and industry conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the allowance for loan losses was $5.3 million while total nonperforming loans was $20.9 million. The total nonperforming loan amount is large for a bank of our size and is primarily the result of our acquisition of several troubled banks. The amount of our allowance for loan losses for these nonperforming loans is determined by our management team through periodic reviews. As most nonperforming loans are related to acquired banks, they were marked to market and recorded at fair value at acquisition with no carryover of the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, our allowance for loan losses mainly reflects the general component allowance for performing loans.\nLike all banks, we have developed and applied a methodology for determining, based upon a number of factors-including, for example, historical loss rates and assumptions regarding future losses-the appropriate level of allowance to maintain in respect of possible loan losses. In applying this methodology and determining the appropriate level of the allowance, we inherently face a high degree of subjectivity and are required to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans that we originate, identification of additional problem loans originated by us and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for probable loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if our methodology or assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses are not sound, then our allowance for loan losses will not be sufficient to cover our loan losses. See Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6, \u201cLoans\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this estimate and our methodology.\nGiven our limited history and significant portfolio growth, many of the loans originated by C1 Bank may be unseasoned, meaning that many of the loans were originated relatively recently. In particular, approximately 71% of our loans outstanding at December 31, 2014, had been originated by C1 Bank since 2010. Our limited experience with these loans does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our expectations, which could negatively affect our performance.\nOur financial performance will be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our growth strategy.\nOur current growth strategy is to grow organically and supplement that growth with select acquisitions. Our ability to grow organically depends primarily on generating loans and deposits of acceptable risk and expense, and we may not be successful in continuing this organic growth. Our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion, recruit and retain qualified personnel, and fund growth at a reasonable cost, depends upon prevailing economic conditions, maintenance of sufficient capital, competitive factors and changes in banking laws, among other factors. Conversely, if we grow too quickly and are unable to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth, whether organic or through select acquisitions, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe institutions we have acquired, and may acquire in the future, have high levels of distressed assets and we may not be able to realize the value we predict from these assets or accurately estimate the future write-downs taken in respect of these assets.\nDelinquencies and losses in the loan portfolios and other assets of financial institutions that we have acquired, and may acquire in the future, may exceed our initial forecasts developed during the due diligence investigation prior to acquiring those institutions. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on an entity we decide to acquire, this diligence may not reveal all material issues that may affect that particular entity. The diligence process in FDIC-assisted transactions is also expedited due to the short acquisition timeline that is typical for these depository institutions. If, during the diligence process, we fail to identify issues specific to an entity or the environment in which the entity operates, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in other reporting losses. Moreover, the process of resolving the problem assets that we have acquired takes a significant amount of time. Throughout this process, such problem assets are subject to regular reappraisals, which could lead to write-offs or require us to establish additional allowance for loan losses. Any of these events could adversely affect the financial condition, liquidity, capital position and value of institutions we acquire and of the Company as a whole.\nChanges in interest rates could have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates could have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in financial markets in the United States and in other countries. Our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates, but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest-sensitive instruments and key driver rates, as well as balance sheet growth, client loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables. In an environment in which interest rates are increasing, our interest costs on liabilities may increase more rapidly than our income on interest-earning assets. This could result in a deterioration of our net interest margin.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our loan-to-deposit ratio, calculated by dividing our total loans by our total deposits, exceeded 100% at December 31, 2014. A higher loan-to-deposit ratio generally means that a financial institution might not have enough liquidity to cover any unforeseen requirements or that the institution is more reliant on borrowings that may no longer be available.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, the financial services industry, or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets and diminished expectations or growth in the financial services industry.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth.\nWe rely on customer deposits, advances from the FHLB, nationally marketed CDs, brokered CDs and lines of credit at other financial institutions to fund our operations. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nFHLB borrowings and other current sources of liquidity may not be available or, if available, sufficient to provide adequate funding for operations. Furthermore, our own actions could result in a loss of adequate funding. For example, our availability at the FHLB could be reduced if we are deemed to have poor documentation or processes. Accordingly, we may seek additional higher-cost debt in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our growth and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur loan portfolio includes unsecured, commercial, real estate, consumer and other loans that may have higher risks, and we may exceed the regulatory guidelines for commercial real estate loans.\nOur commercial real estate, residential real estate, construction, commercial, and consumer loans at December 31, 2014, were $723.6 million, $224.4 million, $107.4 million, $75.4 million, and $57.7 million, respectively, or 60.9%, 18.9%, 9.0%, 6.3%, and 4.9%, respectively, of our total loans. We have a high concentration of commercial real estate loans which at December 31, 2013 exceeded the guidance by bank regulators. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our ratio for construction, development and other land loans to total capital was 57% and 73%, respectively, compared to the FDIC guideline of 100%, while the ratio for commercial real estate loans (including construction, development and other land loans and loans secured by multifamily and nonowner occupied nonfarm nonresidential property) to total capital was 284% and 365%, respectively, compared to the FDIC guideline of 300%. The lower ratios at December 31, 2014 when compared to December 31, 2013, resulted from the impact of the initial public offering. In 2013, our board of directors authorized us to operate up to 400% of total risk based capital for commercial real estate loans until December 2014. Our directors extended their authorization until December 2015.\nCommercial loans and commercial real estate loans generally carry larger balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. As a result, banking regulators continue to give greater scrutiny to lenders with a high concentration of commercial real estate loans in their portfolios, such as us, and such lenders are expected to implement stricter underwriting standards, internal controls, risk management policies, and portfolio stress testing, as well as higher capital levels and loss allowances. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. During the recent economic downturn, financial institutions with high commercial real estate loan concentrations were more susceptible to failure. If we cannot effectively manage the risk associated with our high concentration of commercial real estate loans, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe nature of our commercial loan portfolio may expose us to increased lending risks.\nWe make both secured and unsecured commercial loans. Secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. Because of this lack of collateral, we are limited in our ability to collect on defaulted unsecured loans.\nWe are subject to risks associated with loans to Brazilian companies.\nWe have made commercial loans to three Brazilian corporations, with aggregate outstanding balances at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 of $44.0 million and $44.8 million, respectively. The collateral for these loans is held in Brazil and consists primarily of real estate. Two of the loans are secured by a first lien on farmland appraised at $80.8 million, of which we are entitled to 50.9%, as the collateral is shared on a first lien basis with another bank. Another loan is secured by a first lien on farmland appraised at $79.5 million and the final loan is secured by closely held stock. There is inherent country risk associated with this international business. International trade laws, U.S. relations with Brazil, foreign exchange volatility, the foreign nature of the Brazilian legal system and government policy, and regulatory changes may inhibit our ability to collect payment, or claim collateral (if any) located in Brazil. Furthermore, we may experience loss due to unforeseen economic, social or weather conditions that affect Brazilian markets and in particular the market for Brazilian agriculture products. The expense of collecting on defaulted loans may be higher than in the United States, which may reduce the size of any recovery. We are also subject to the risk that the value of any real estate collateral could decline, further harming our ability to fully collect on any defaulted loan. The substantial size of each of these individual relationships could, if unpaid, materially adversely affect our earnings and capital.\nOur largest loan relationships currently make up a material percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31 2014, our ten largest loan relationships totaled over $266.2 million in loan exposure, or 19.3% of the total loan portfolio and unfunded commitments. The concentration risk associated with having a small number of extremely large loan relationships is that if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be at serious risk of material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships and any loss or increase in the allowance would negatively affect our earnings and capital. Even if the loans are collateralized, the large increase in classified assets could harm our reputation with our regulators and inhibit our ability to execute our business plan. The repayment of any of these relationships could harm our interest income.\nMany of our investments are focused on long-term returns, are expensive and may not yield the expected returns to justify their cost.\nPart of our business plan has been to make material investments into our infrastructure, technology, banking centers and personnel, with a focus on long-term results. However, many of these investments are expensive in the short term and rely heavily on their future success to remain financially justifiable. Examples include (i) we spend materially more than an average bank our size on sports marketing, the results of which are hard to measure and may not justify the cost; (ii) our management-training program is expensive and the graduates from this program may not produce superior results to employees from less expensive forms of hiring and training; (iii) our strategy to fund our liabilities with longer-duration, higher-cost funds that will only pay off if interest rates increase during their term; and (iv) we invest heavily in technology to increase our productivity and our relationships with our clients, yet the products are new and may not yield the desired results. These investments, especially if not successful, reduce earnings, capital and financial flexibility and if not successful in the long term will have not produced the desired returns.\nWe may realize future losses if (i) our levels of nonperforming assets increase and if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of assets are less than the carrying value of such assets or (ii) we are unable to sell our OREO assets within the holding periods established by Federal and State regulators.\nNonperforming assets (including nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, or OREO) totaled $55.8 million at December 31, 2014. These nonperforming assets can adversely affect net income through reduced interest income, increased operating expenses incurred to maintain such assets or loss charges related to subsequent declines in the estimated fair value of foreclosed assets. Any decrease in real estate market prices may lead to nonperforming asset write-downs, with a corresponding expense in our income statement. We evaluate nonperforming assets periodically and write down the carrying value of these assets if the results of our evaluation require it. Holding nonperforming assets is expensive and negatively impacts our earnings and results of operations. The expenses associated with nonperforming assets and any further write-downs, both expected and unexpected, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, Federal and state regulators place limits on the total amount of time that we may hold foreclosed upon real estate. If we are unable to sell such real estate within the prescribed time frames (or if our regulators are unwilling to grant us extensions to the holding period), we may be required to charge off OREO balances, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank currently invests in bank-owned life insurance (\u201cBOLI\u201d) and may continue to do so in the future. Investing in BOLI exposes us to liquidity, credit and interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank had $43.9 million in general and separate account BOLI contracts at December 31, 2014. BOLI is an illiquid long-term asset that provides tax savings because cash value growth and life insurance proceeds are not taxable. However, if the Bank needed additional liquidity and converted the BOLI to cash, any cash value gain above basis would be subject to ordinary income tax. The Bank is also exposed to the credit risk of the underlying securities in the investment portfolio, and to the insurance carrier provider credit risk (in a general account contract). If BOLI was exchanged to another carrier, additional fees would be incurred and a tax-free exchange could only be done for insureds that were still actively employed by the Bank at that time. There is interest rate risk relating to the market value of the underlying investment securities associated with the BOLI in that there is no assurance that the market value of these securities will not decline.\nCertain of our activities are restricted due to commitments entered into with the Federal Reserve by us and certain or our foreign national controlling stockholders.\nCertain of our controlling stockholders are foreign nationals, and we and these controlling stockholders have entered into commitments with the Federal Reserve that restrict some of our activities. In particular, we are restricted from engaging in certain transactions with these controlling stockholders, their immediate family, any company controlled by the controlling stockholders, and any executive officer, director, or principal stockholder of a company controlled by these controlling stockholders. Such transactions include (i) extensions of credit, (ii) covered transactions described in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, (iii) any other business transaction or relationship, without approval of the Federal Reserve, with any company controlled by such controlling stockholder, and (iv) restrictions on the amount of deposits held by the Bank of any company controlled by such controlling stockholders. We are also prohibited from incurring additional debt to any third party without prior approval from the Federal Reserve. Finally, we are restricted from directly accepting wires from or sending wires to foreign accounts, and we must instead use a correspondent bank when our clients need to send or receive such foreign wires. This makes the wire process more difficult for our clients and as a result may result in a loss of business from these clients.\nThe loss of any member of our management team and our inability to make up for such loss with a qualified replacement could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depend upon the continued success of our management team, in particular our President & Chief Executive Officer, Trevor Burgess, and other key employees. Competition for qualified management in our industry is intense. Many of the companies with which we compete for management personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to retain any of our key management personnel, our business could be harmed.\nOur business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.\nCommercial and consumer banking is highly competitive. Our market contains not only a large number of community and regional banks, but also a significant presence of the country\u2019s largest commercial banks. We compete with other state and national financial institutions as well as savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions for deposits and loans. In addition, we compete with financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and several government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Some of these competitors may have a long history of successful operations in our markets, greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships, as well as better established depositor bases. Competitors with greater resources may possess an advantage by attracting our clients through very aggressive product pricing that we are unable to match, maintaining numerous banking locations in more convenient sites, operating more ATMs and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns or operating a more developed internet platform.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates, as well making it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for certain products and services than we can offer. For example, in the current low interest rate environment, competitors with lower costs of capital may solicit our customers to refinance their loans with a lower interest rate.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 our ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on quality service and high ethical standards;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively;\n\u2022 our ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022 the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services that we offer to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022 the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022 industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s lending limit per borrower will continue to be lower than many of our competitors, which may discourage potential clients and limit our loan growth.\nThe Bank\u2019s legally mandated lending limit per borrower is lower than that of many of our larger competitors because we have less capital. At December 31, 2014, the Bank\u2019s legal lending limit for loans was approximately $46.1 million to any one borrower on a secured basis and $27.7 million on an unsecured basis. The Bank\u2019s lower lending limit may discourage potential borrowers with loan needs that exceed our limit from doing business with us, which may restrict our ability to grow. In addition, in July 2014, we established a $30.0 million \u201chouse limit\u201d guideline for future relationships that may further impact our ability to lend to large borrowers and discourage these large borrowers from doing business with us.\nWe may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions or market utilities.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions or market utilities, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers\u2019 representations that their financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nOur small to medium-sized business and entrepreneurial customers may have fewer financial resources than larger entities to weather a downturn in the economy, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs. These small to medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs may have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. In general, if economic conditions negatively impact the Florida market generally and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including those created by C1 Labs. If we fail to successfully maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings, or other competitive harm. We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Others, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or services or design around our intellectual property, and in such cases we could not assert our intellectual property rights against such parties. Further, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential or proprietary information. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how, which could be time-consuming and expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain rights with respect to third-party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, aspects of our business and our products and services rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\nIn some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products, services or technology infringe or otherwise violate their intellectual property or proprietary rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, services or technology. Any of these third parties could bring an infringement claim against us with respect to our products, services or technology. We may also be subject to third-party infringement, misappropriation, breach or other claims with respect to copyright, trademark, license usage or other intellectual property rights. In addition, in recent years, individuals and groups, including patent holding companies have been purchasing intellectual property assets in order to make claims of infringement and attempt to extract settlements from companies in the banking and financial services industry. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities including damage awards, result in an injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our services, require us to redesign affected products or services, or require us to seek licenses which may only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could result in serious reputational harm to our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. In particular, we rely almost exclusively on FiServ, Inc. for our information management systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. As a financial institution, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, disease pandemics, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe are under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-attacks, especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, are less frequent but could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we may suffer such losses in the future. The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage, damage to our competitive position and the disruption of our operations, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including customer or employee fraud.\nEmployee error and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee error and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee error could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nIf our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured, exceeds applicable insurance limits or if insurance coverage is denied or not available, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make future acquisitions, which may be restricted by applicable regulation, difficult to integrate, divert management resources, result in unanticipated costs, or dilute our stockholders.\nPart of our continuing business strategy is to make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that complement our current position or offer growth opportunities.\nThe BHCA and federal and Florida state banking laws restrict the activities that the Company and the Bank may lawfully conduct, whether directly or indirectly through acquisitions, subsidiaries and certain interests in other companies. These laws also affect the ability to effect a change of control of the Company or another bank holding company, as discussed under \u201c-There are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\u201d These regulatory regimes are summarized in greater detail under \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Holding Company Regulation\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Bank Regulation.\u201d Certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and we may not receive timely regulatory approval for future acquisitions. Changes in the number or scope of permissible activities under applicable law could have an adverse effect on our ability to realize our strategic goals.\nFurthermore, future acquisitions could pose numerous risks to our operations, including:\n\u2022 we may have difficulty integrating the purchased operations;\n\u2022 we may incur substantial unanticipated integration costs;\n\u2022 assimilating the acquired businesses may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business;\n\u2022 acquisitions could result in the loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired operations;\n\u2022 we may have difficulty retaining or developing the acquired businesses\u2019 customers;\n\u2022 acquisitions could adversely affect our existing business relationships with customers;\n\u2022 we may be unable to effectively compete in the markets serviced by the acquired bank;\n\u2022 we may fail to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits and/or the strategic benefits of the acquisitions; and\n\u2022 we may incur liabilities from the acquired businesses and we may not be successful in seeking indemnification for such liabilities or claims.\nIn connection with these acquisitions or investments, we could incur debt, amortization expenses related to intangible assets or large and immediate write-offs, assume liabilities, or issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership. We may not be able to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nWe are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements is time-consuming and results in increased costs to us, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are inexperienced with these reporting and accounting requirements and, as such, these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we will need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. We will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. While at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had adopted all new accounting standards that could affect the comparability of our financial statements to those of other public entities, we may elect to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies.\nWhen these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events would negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur market area is susceptible to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, other severe weather events and related flooding and wind damage. These natural disasters could negatively impact regional economic conditions, disrupt operations, cause a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us, damage our banking facilities and offices, result in a decline in local loan demand and our loan originations, and negatively impact our growth strategy. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future natural disasters will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of natural disasters.\nWe are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies we have acquired). In addition, from time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to regulation, which increases the cost and expense of regulatory compliance and, therefore, reduces our net income and may restrict our growth and ability to acquire other financial institutions.\nAs a bank holding company under federal law, we are subject to regulation under the BHCA, and the examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. In addition to supervising and examining us, the Federal Reserve, through its adoption of regulations implementing the BHCA, places certain restrictions on the activities that are deemed permissible for bank holding companies to engage in. Changes in the number or scope of permissible activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to realize our strategic goals.\nAs a Florida state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is separately subject to regulation by both the FDIC and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, or OFR. The FDIC and OFR regulate numerous aspects of the Bank\u2019s operations, including adequate capital and financial condition, permissible types and amounts of extensions of credit and investments, permissible nonbanking activities and restrictions on dividend payments. The Bank may undergo periodic examinations by the FDIC and OFR. Following such examinations, the Bank may be required, among other things, to change its asset valuations or the amounts of required loan loss allowances or to restrict its operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSupervision, regulation, and examination of the Company and the Bank by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, rather than holders of our common stock.\nParticularly as a result of new regulations and regulatory agencies under the Dodd-Frank Act, we may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations. This allocation of resources, as well as any failure to comply with applicable requirements, may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in laws, government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nFinancial institutions have been the subject of significant legislative and regulatory changes and may be the subject of further significant legislation or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations, including those with respect to federal and state taxation, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the costs and burden of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects our credit conditions, as well as those of our borrowers, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our borrowers and, therefore, on our results of operations.\nThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act may have a material effect on our operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are, or may include:\n\u2022 increases in regulatory capital requirements and additional restrictions on the types of instruments that may satisfy such requirements;\n\u2022 creation of new government regulatory agencies (particularly the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will develop and enforce rules for bank and nonbank providers of consumer financial products);\n\u2022 changes to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022 regulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u2022 changes in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge;\n\u2022 changes in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention; and\n\u2022 changes in corporate governance requirements for public companies.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, required or will require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented, some of which have been enacted or proposed by the applicable federal agencies. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements, or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to investors in our common stock.\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and recent rulemaking, we will become subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in July 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted final rules, or the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, to update their general risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements to incorporate agreements reflected in the Third Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel III Capital Standards, as well as the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules are described in more detail in \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation - U.S. Basel III Capital Rules.\u201d While we are continuing to prepare for the impact of the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules may still have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating our FDIC deposit insurance.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, or to maintain appropriate capital levels in general, could affect customer and investor confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial conditions, generally.\nWe may be required to contribute capital or assets to the Bank that could otherwise be invested or deployed more profitably elsewhere.\nFederal law and regulatory policy impose a number of obligations on bank holding companies that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of insured depository subsidiaries and to the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance fund. For example, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its insured depository subsidiaries and to commit financial resources to support such institutions where it might not do so otherwise, even if we would not ordinarily do so and even if such contribution is to our detriment or the detriment of our stockholders. These situations include guaranteeing the compliance of an \u201cundercapitalized\u201d bank with its obligations under a capital restoration plan, as described further under \u201cBusiness-Bank Regulation- Capitalization Levels and Prompt Corrective Action.\u201d\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it and, therefore, we may be required to issue common stock or debt. Issuing additional shares of common stock would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we are required to issue debt, and in the event of a bankruptcy by the Company, the bankruptcy trustee would assume any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the Company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and would adversely impact the Company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNew and future rulemaking by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators, as well as enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, may have a material effect on our operations and operating costs.\nThe CFPB has the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing federal consumer protection statutes and to issue new regulations and, with respect to institutions of our size, has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to such laws and regulations. In some cases, regulators such as the FTC and the Department of Justice also retain certain rulemaking or enforcement authority, and we also remain subject to certain state consumer protection laws. As an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has placed significant emphasis on consumer complaint management and has established a public consumer complaint database to encourage consumers to file complaints that they may have against financial institutions. We are expected to monitor and respond to these complaints, including those that we deem frivolous, and doing so may require management to reallocate resources away from more profitable endeavors.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a series of final rules in January 2013 related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. These final rules, most provisions of which became effective January 10, 2014, prohibit creditors, such as the Bank, from extending mortgage loans without regard for the consumer\u2019s ability to repay and add restrictions and requirements to mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules restrict the application of prepayment penalties and compensation practices relating to mortgage loan underwriting. Compliance with these rules will likely increase our overall regulatory compliance costs and require us to change our underwriting practices. Moreover, these rules may adversely affect the volume of mortgage loans that we underwrite and may subject the Bank to increased potential liability related to its residential loan origination activities.\nBanking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nFlorida and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. Accommodating such examinations may require management to reallocate resources, which would otherwise be used in the day-to-day operation of other aspects of our business. If, as a result of an examination, a Florida or federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, allowance for loan losses, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nFlorida financial institutions face a higher risk of noncompliance and enforcement actions with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nLike all U.S. financial institutions, we are subject to monitoring requirements under federal law, including AML and BSA matters. Since September 11, 2001, banking regulators have intensified their focus on AML and BSA compliance requirements, particularly the AML provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC. Moreover, we operate in areas designated as High Intensity Financial Crime Areas and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. Since 2004, federal banking regulators and examiners have been extremely aggressive in their supervision and examination of financial institutions located in the state of Florida with respect to institutions\u2019 BSA and AML compliance. Consequently, a number of formal enforcement actions have been issued against Florida financial institutions. Although we have adopted policies, procedures and controls to comply with the BSA and other AML statutes and regulations, this aggressive supervision and examination, and increased likelihood of enforcement actions may increase our operating costs, which could negatively affect our results of operation and reputation.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity, and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022 market conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in our industry in particular;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u2022 introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022 sales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 regulatory developments;\n\u2022 litigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022 economic and political conditions or events.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nThe trading market for our common stock will also be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nIf a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf substantial amounts of our common stock are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception that our principal stockholders (Marcelo Faria de Lima, Erwin Russel, Marcio Camargo and Trevor Burgess), who collectively own approximately 57.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, might sell shares of common stock could also depress our market price. Our directors, executive officers and certain additional other holders of our common stock are subject to the lock-up agreements described in \u201cUnderwriting\u201d and the Rule 144 holding period requirements described in \u201cShares Eligible for Future Sale\u201d included in the Company\u2019s Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC. There were 12,727,632 additional shares eligible for sale in the public market when all of the lock-up periods expired and the holding periods elapsed on February 8, 2015. The market price of shares of our common stock may drop significantly because the restrictions on resale by our existing stockholders have lapsed. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nOur principal stockholders have historically controlled, and in the future will continue to control us.\nBecause our principal stockholders (Marcelo Faria de Lima, Erwin Russel, Marcio Camargo and Trevor Burgess) collectively own a majority of our common stock, these stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions. Our principal stockholders are also business partners in business ventures in addition to our company. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. In addition, a dispute among these individuals in connection with the Company or another business venture could impact their relationship at the Company and, because of their prominence within the Company, the Company itself. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nWith certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock. These provisions effectively inhibit certain mergers or other business combinations, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently exempt from certain corporate governance requirements since we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NYSE rules and, as a result, you will not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements.\nOur principal stockholders (Marcelo Faria de Lima, Erwin Russel, Marcio Camargo and Trevor Burgess) collectively hold a majority of our common stock. As a result, we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the listing requirements of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including the requirements that our board of directors, our executive compensation committee and our directors\u2019 nominating and corporate governance committee meet the standard of independence established by those corporate governance requirements. We intend to avail ourselves of certain of these exemptions. The independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the exchange on which we list our common stock.\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in the Bank, to secure that debt.\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of common stock. For example, interest must be paid to the lender before dividends can be paid to the stockholders, and loans must be paid off before any assets can be distributed to stockholders if we were to liquidate. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if the Bank were profitable.\nShares of the Company\u2019s common stock are not insured deposits and may lose value.\nThe shares of the Company\u2019s common stock are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency.\nThe laws that regulate our operations are designed for the protection of depositors and the public, not our stockholders.\nThe federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our operations give regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement responsibilities, and generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund, and not to protect stockholders. These laws and regulations can materially affect our future business. Laws and regulations now affecting us may be changed at any time, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations by bank regulatory authorities is also subject to change.\nFuture changes in laws and regulations or changes in their interpretation may also adversely affect our business. Legislative and regulatory changes may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for nonbank competitors.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict both the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nBoth the Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. These federal and state laws, regulations and policies are described in greater detail in \u201cBusiness-Bank Regulation-Bank Dividends\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Holding Company Regulation-Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends,\u201d but generally look to factors such as previous results and net income, capital needs, asset quality, existence of enforcement or remediation proceedings, and overall financial condition.\nFor the foreseeable future, the majority, if not all, of the Company\u2019s revenue will be from any dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends also depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us. Furthermore, the present and future dividend policy of the Bank is subject to the discretion of its board of directors.\nWe cannot guarantee that the Company or the Bank will be permitted by financial condition or applicable regulatory restrictions to pay dividends, that the board of directors of the Bank will elect to pay dividends to us, nor can we guarantee the timing or amount of any dividend actually paid. See \u201cBusiness-Holding Company Regulation-Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends\u201d for a discussion on our current dividend policy.\nAnti-takeover protections under the Florida Business Corporation Act, or the FBCA, and other factors will make it more difficult to realize the value of an investment in the Company.\nIn general, the three principal ways that the stockholders of any company can realize a return on their investment are (i) to receive distributions (i.e., dividends) from the company, (ii) to sell their individual ownership interests to a third party, or (iii) to participate in a company-wide transaction in which they are able to sell their ownership interests, or an \u201cexit event,\u201d regardless of whether the exit event is voluntary (such as a friendly merger) or involuntary (such as a hostile takeover). There are significant impediments to the ability of a stockholder of the Company to realize a return on his or her investment in any of those ways. As stated previously under \u201cBusiness-Holding Company Regulation-Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends,\u201d we do not intend to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock up to the 100 million shares authorized in our certificate of formation. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee stock option plans, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are not currently required to comply with SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are, therefore, not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. We will be required to comply with these rules upon ceasing to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. However, we are required to perform our own assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and prepare a report on this assessment beginning with our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWhen evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make our financial statements not comparable with those of another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 14849, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BNK"}
