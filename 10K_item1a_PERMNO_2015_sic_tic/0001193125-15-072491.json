RISK FACTORS\nUnited is subject to risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair United\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRISKS RELATING TO UNITED\u2019S BUSINESS\nUnited\u2019s business may be adversely affected by conditions in financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nUnited\u2019s business is concentrated in the West Virginia, Northern Virginia and Shenandoah Valley Virginia market areas. As a result, its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes if there are changes in the economic conditions in these areas. A prolonged period of economic recession or other adverse economic conditions in these areas could have a negative impact on United Bankshares. A significant decline in general economic conditions nationally, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets, declines in the housing market, a tightening credit environment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations which occurred during this past year.\nThe U.S. economy was in recession from December 2007 through June 2009. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. was greatly reduced. Although economic conditions have improved, certain sectors, such as real estate and manufacturing, remain weak and unemployment remains high. Continued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on United\u2019s borrowers or its customers, which could adversely affect United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, local governments and many businesses are still experiencing difficulty due to lower consumer spending and decreased liquidity in the credit markets. Deterioration in local economic conditions, particularly within United\u2019s geographic regions and markets, could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for loan losses. United may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market have resulted, and may continue to result, in deterioration in credit quality of United\u2019s loan portfolios, and such deterioration in credit quality has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on United\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nMarket developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.\n\u2022\nThe processes United uses to estimate allowance for loan losses and reserves may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments that may no longer be capable of accurate estimation.\n\u2022\nUnited\u2019s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future charge-offs.\n\u2022\nUnited expects to face increased regulation of its industry, and compliance with such regulation may increase its costs, limit its ability to pursue business opportunities, and increase compliance challenges.\nAs the above conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, United could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines or other-than-temporary impairments could have a materially adverse effect on future earnings and regulatory capital.\nContinued volatility in the fair value for certain investment securities, whether caused by changes in market conditions, interest rates, credit risk of the issuer, the expected yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant fluctuations in the value of the securities as well as any regulatory rulemaking such as the Volcker Rule which could exclude or limit the holdings of certain investment securities. This could have a material adverse impact on United\u2019s accumulated other comprehensive income and shareholders\u2019 equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations. Furthermore, future downgrades, defaults or prepayments, including the liquidation of the underlying collateral in certain securities, could result in future classifications as other-than-temporarily impaired. This could have a material impact on United\u2019s future earnings, although the impact on shareholders\u2019 equity will be offset by any amount already included in other comprehensive income for securities that were temporarily impaired.\nThere are no assurances as to adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nUnited believes that its allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level appropriate to absorb any probable losses in its loan portfolio given the current information known to management.\nManagement establishes the allowance based upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nhistorical loan loss experience;\n\u2022\nindustry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values;\n\u2022\nthe amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security;\n\u2022\ncurrent economic conditions that may affect the borrower\u2019s ability to pay and value of collateral;\n\u2022\nvolume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio; and\n\u2022\nother factors management believes are relevant.\nThese determinations are based upon estimates that are inherently subjective, and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events, so ultimate losses may differ from current estimates. Changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that are generally beyond United\u2019s control, can affect United\u2019s loan losses. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of United\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. United can provide no assurance that its allowance is sufficient to cover actual loan losses should such losses differ substantially from our current estimates.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators, as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions, periodically review United\u2019s allowance for loan losses, and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Furthermore, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, United will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect United\u2019s business.\nUnited\u2019s earnings, like most financial institutions, are significantly dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income United earns on loans and other assets which earn interest and the interest expense incurred to fund those assets, such as on savings deposits and borrowed money. Therefore, changes in general market interest rates, such as a change in the monetary policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or otherwise beyond those which are contemplated by United\u2019s interest rate risk model and policy, could have an effect on net interest income. For more information concerning United\u2019s interest rate risk model and policy, see the discussion under the caption \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under Item 7A.\nUnited is subject to credit risk.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. United seeks to mitigate the risk inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to prudent loan approval practices. Although United believes that its loan approval criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans the Company makes, United may incur losses on loans that meet our loan approval criteria. Due to recent economic conditions affecting the real estate market, many lending institutions, including United, have experienced substantial declines in the performance of their loans, including construction, land development and land loans. The value of real estate collateral supporting many construction and land development loans, land loans, commercial and multi-family loans have declined and may continue to decline. United cannot assure that the economic conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio will improve and thus, United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected.\nLoss of United\u2019s Chief Executive Officer or other executive officers could adversely affect its business.\nUnited\u2019s success is dependent upon the continued service and skills of its executive officers and senior management. If United loses the services of these key personnel, it could have a negative impact on United\u2019s business because of their skills, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. The services of Richard M. Adams, United\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, would be particularly difficult to replace. United and Mr. Adams are parties to an Employment Agreement providing for his continued employment by United through March 31, 2018.\nUnited operates in a highly competitive market.\nUnited faces a high degree of competition in all of the markets it serves. United considers all of West Virginia to be included in its market area. This area includes the five largest West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA): the Parkersburg MSA, the Charleston MSA, the Huntington MSA, the Morgantown MSA and the Wheeling MSA. United serves the Ohio counties of Lawrence, Belmont, Jefferson and Washington and Fayette county in Pennsylvania primarily because of their close proximity to the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders and United banking offices located in those counties or in nearby West Virginia. United\u2019s Virginia markets include the Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. MSA, the Winchester MSA, the Harrisonburg MSA, and the Charlottesville MSA. United considers all of the above locations to be the primary market area for the business of its banking subsidiaries.\nThere is a risk that aggressive competition could result in United controlling a smaller share of these markets. A decline in market share could lead to a decline in net income which would have a negative impact on stockholder value.\nUnited may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. United has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, or other institutional clients. Recent defaults by financial services institutions, and even rumors or questions about a financial institution or the financial services industry in general, have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by United or other institutions. Any such losses could adversely affect United\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nUnited is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\nUnited is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect United\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls, among other things, to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of United\u2019s customers. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect United in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products United may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. United expends substantial effort and incurs costs to improve its systems, audit capabilities, staffing and training in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, but the regulatory authorities may determine that such efforts are insufficient. Failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nIn the normal course of business, United and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments that the Company has made and the businesses in which United has engaged. Recently, federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, they could have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nUnited may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but capital may not be available when it is needed.\nUnited is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, United may elect to raise additional capital to support the Company\u2019s business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or United may otherwise elect to raise additional capital. In that regard, a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market, deteriorating economic conditions, declines in real estate values and other factors, which may diminish United\u2019s ability to raise additional capital.\nUnited\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on United\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, United cannot be assured of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If United cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUnited\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nUnited relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. In addition, as part of its business, United collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential client and customer information. United\u2019s facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While United has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage United\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject United to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rules effecting debit card interchange fees under the Durbin Amendment will negatively impact our electronic banking income.\nThe Durbin Amendment required the Federal Reserve to establish a cap on the rate merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions (i.e. the interchange rate). The Federal Reserve issued final rules, effective October 1, 2011, for establishing standards, including a cap, for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The final rule established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to\nthe costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction, a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment, and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. As a result of the completion of the acquisition of Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. which resulted in United having assets more than $10 billion, United is subject to the cap on the interchange fees under the Durbin Amendment which will result in lower debit card interchange fees.\nUnited will be subject to higher regulatory capital requirements and failure to comply with these standards may impact dividend payments, equity repurchases and executive compensation.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to United, United Bank (West Virginia) and United Bank (Virginia). The rules implement the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, or the Basel III Capital Rules. The new rules were effective for United and its banking subsidiaries on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain of the new rules).\nThe Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called \u201cCommon Equity Tier 1\u201d, or CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and \u201cAdditional Tier 1 Capital\u201d instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/ adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations, and particularly as applied to CET1.\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, the initial minimum capital and leverage ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows:\n\u2022\n4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets.\n\u2022\n6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.\n\u2022\n8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.\n\u2022\n4.0% Tier 1 capital to average assets.\nIn addition to raising minimum capital and leverage ratios, the Basel III Capital Rules also establish a capital conservation buffer that is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019 in equal annual installments, and when fully implemented the capital conservation buffer will effectively add 2.5% to each of the minimum capital ratios. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\nWith respect to United\u2019s banking subsidiaries, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d category.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In particular, the Basel III Capital Rules increase risk weights that apply to past-due exposures and high volatility commercial real estate loans.\nThe Basel III changes will result in generally higher minimum capital ratios that require United and its subsidiaries to maintain capital buffers above minimum requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and executive bonus payments. In addition, the application of more stringent capital requirements for United, United Bank (West Virginia) and United Bank (Virginia) could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital and result in additional regulatory actions if United were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit United\u2019s ability to make distributions, including paying dividends.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, regulators of banks and bank holding companies have become more likely to impose capital requirements on bank holding companies and banks that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair United\u2019s ability to accurately and timely report its financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting United\u2019s business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. Management believes that United\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting are currently effective. Management will continually review and analyze the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting for Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact United\u2019s ability to report its financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact United\u2019s business and stock price.\nUnited could face unanticipated environmental liabilities or costs related to real property owned or acquired through foreclosure. Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those related to investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites, could have a negative effect on expenses and results of operations.\nA significant portion of United\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, United may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, United may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require United to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit United\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase exposure to environmental liability. Although United has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s downgrade in the U.S. government\u2019s sovereign credit rating, and in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by certain related institutions, agencies and instrumentalities, creates risks to United\u2019s net income, capital levels, financial condition and liquidity and causes uncertainties in general economic conditions that may adversely impact it.\nIn August 2011, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the United States long-term debt ratings and downgraded the credit ratings of certain long-term debt instruments issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other U.S. government agencies linked to long-term U.S. debt. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, including United. These downgrades could adversely affect the market value of such\ninstruments, and could adversely impact United\u2019s ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. In addition, these downgrades could materially affect financial markets and economic conditions, which may affect United\u2019s net income, financial condition and liquidity and result in future changes in capital requirements or United\u2019s investment portfolio in response to management\u2019s assessment of the related risk weightings. United cannot predict if, when or how these changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions. As a result, it is possible that these changes could result in a significant adverse impact to United, and could affect other risks to which it is subject.\nNew accounting or tax pronouncements or interpretations may be issued by the accounting profession, regulators or other government bodies which could change existing accounting methods. Changes in accounting methods could negatively impact United\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent accounting and tax rules, standards, policies and interpretations influence the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Events that may not have a direct impact on United, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S. companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators and authoritative bodies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and various taxing authorities, responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revision to laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting standards may adversely affect reported financial condition and results of operations.\nUnited\u2019s business continuity plans or data security systems could prove to be inadequate, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, its business and a negative impact on results of operations.\nUnited relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, whether due to severe weather, natural disasters, cyber attack, acts of war or terrorism, criminal activity or other factors, could result in failures or disruptions in general ledger, deposit, loan, customer relationship management and other systems. While United has disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of United\u2019s information systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nThe negative economic effects caused by terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, potential attacks and other destabilizing events would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of United\u2019s loan portfolio and could reduce its customer base, level of deposits, and demand for its financial products such as loans.\nHigh inflation, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, including cyber attacks, an escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, and other factors could have a negative impact on the economy of the Mid-Atlantic regions in which United operates. An additional economic downturn in its markets would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of United\u2019s loan portfolio by impacting the ability of its customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and may reduce the level of deposits in its bank and the stability of its deposit funding sources. An additional economic downturn could also have a significant impact on the demand for United\u2019s products and services. The cumulative effect of these matters on United\u2019s results of operations and financial condition would likely be adverse and material.\nUnited\u2019s vendors could fail to fulfill their contractual obligations, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, its business and a negative impact on results of operations.\nUnited has entered into subcontracts for the supply of current and future services, such as data processing,\nmortgage loan processing and servicing, and certain property management functions. These services must be available on a continuous and timely basis and be in compliance with any regulatory requirements. Failure to do so could substantially harm United\u2019s business.\nUnited often purchases services from vendors under agreements that typically can be terminated on a periodic basis. There can be no assurance, however, that vendors will be able to meet their obligations under these agreements or that United will be able to compel them to do so. Risks of relying on vendors include the following:\n\u2022\nIf an existing agreement expires or a certain service is discontinued by a vendor, then United may not be able to continue to offer its customers the same breadth of products and its operating results would likely suffer unless it is able to find an alternate supply of a similar service.\n\u2022\nAgreements United may negotiate in the future may commit it to certain minimum spending obligations. It is possible United will not be able to create the market demand to meet such obligations.\n\u2022\nIf market demand for United\u2019s products increases suddenly, its current vendors might not be able to fulfill United\u2019s commercial needs, which would require it to seek new arrangements or new sources of supply, and may result in substantial delays in meeting market demand.\n\u2022\nUnited may not be able to control or adequately monitor the quality of services it receives from its vendors. Poor quality services could damage United\u2019s reputation with its customers.\nPotential problems with vendors such as those discussed above could have a significant adverse effect on United\u2019s business, lead to higher costs and damage its reputation with its customers and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nUnited\u2019s potential inability to integrate companies it may acquire in the future could have a negative effect on its expenses and results of operations.\nOn occasion, United may engage in a strategic acquisition when it believes there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand its business. To fully benefit from such acquisition, however, United must integrate the administrative, financial, sales, lending, collections and marketing functions of the acquired company. If United is unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, it may not realize the benefits of the acquisition, and its financial results may be negatively affected. A completed acquisition may adversely affect United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including its capital requirements and the accounting treatment of the acquisition. Completed acquisitions may also lead to significant unexpected liabilities after the consummation of these acquisitions.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UNITED\u2019S COMMON STOCK\nUnited\u2019s stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for United shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. United\u2019s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated negative variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nNegative recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nPoor operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to United;\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to negative trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nNegative perceptions in the marketplace regarding United and/or its competitors;\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in interest rates or a lending environment with prolonged low interest rates;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the real estate market;\n\u2022\nNegative economic news;\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in government regulations; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause United\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nDividend payments by United\u2019s subsidiaries to United and by United to its shareholders can be restricted.\nThe declaration and payment of future cash dividends will depend on, among other things, United\u2019s earnings, the general economic and regulatory climate, United\u2019s liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by United\u2019s board of directors. Federal Reserve Board policy limits the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, without regulatory approval, and requires that a holding company serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.\nUnited\u2019s principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common stock is cash dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of these dividends by its subsidiaries is also restricted by federal and state banking laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate of approximately $37.6 million and $34.7 million was available for dividend payments from United Bank (WV) and United Bank (VA), respectively, to United without regulatory approval.\nAn investment in United common stock is not an insured deposit.\nUnited common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in United common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this section and elsewhere in this prospectus and joint proxy statement and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, someone who acquires United common stock, could lose some or all of their investment.\nCertain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult to be acquired by a third party, even if perceived to be beneficial to United\u2019s shareholders. These provisions effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which could adversely affect the market price of United\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 11369, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "UBSI"}
