These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nIn addition, this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as \"estimates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"projects,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"may\" and \"will\" or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used. Such statements are based upon our current expectations and speak only as of the date made. These statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs, lower sales volumes, the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions or assumption of unknown liabilities in connection with acquisitions, fluctuations in costs of materials and labor, costs and possible effects of union organizing or other union activities, strikes, loss of key management, uncertainties regarding any existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation, failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the initiation or outcome of arbitrations, litigation or governmental investigations, higher than assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products, the disruption of operations from catastrophic events or from the proposed Merger, disruptions in capital markets, the liquidity of counterparties in financial transactions, changes in federal and state tax laws, failure to complete the proposed Merger in a timely manner, or at all, economic uncertainties and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made, except as required by law.\nAlso note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions relevant to our business. Actual results may differ from certain assumptions we have made causing actual events to vary from expected results. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nGeneral economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance. Increases in labor costs, including healthcare, minimum wages, insurance costs, higher material costs for items, such as linens, other textiles and various raw materials, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher interest rates, inflation, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFluctuations in Canadian currency could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our foreign revenue and operating expenses are transacted in local currencies. Therefore, our results of operations and certain receivables and payables are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nIncreased competition could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with national, regional and local providers. Service, product quality, design, fit, comfort, price, breadth of products offered and convenience to the customer are the primary competitive elements in these industries. If existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower prices, which could be detrimental to our operating results. Our competitors also generally compete with us for possible acquisitions, which can increase the price for acquisitions. In addition, our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing such services. These competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nFailure to comply with various state and federal regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNumerous complex federal and provincial regulations apply to our business, as do various regulations promulgated by state and local agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of employment practices and include requirements surrounding minimum wages, overtime, working conditions and citizenship. We are also subject to numerous transportation and safety laws and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, our business is subject to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended. Likewise, as a contractor to the United States government, various regulations promulgated by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs apply to our business. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, additional costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these various regulations. Additionally, changes in these laws or regulations could substantially increase our operating costs or otherwise affect how we operate our business. Failure to comply with these regulations could\nresult in fines by government authorities and payment of damages to private litigants, affect our ability to service our customers, result in debarment of us as a contractor to the United States government and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating facilities are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing the potential discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. The operation of our business entails risks under environmental laws and regulations. We could incur significant costs, including, without limitation, clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and claims by regulators or third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws and regulations, which among other things, could require us to reduce or cease use of certain equipment and/or limit or stop production at certain facilities. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and disrupt customer relationships.\nWe are currently involved in a limited number of legal matters at various locations related to environmental laws and regulations. As part of our ongoing operations, we also are involved in various property remediation efforts. Historically, we have borne our property remediation costs as part of our ongoing operations. In particular, we have three projects nearing completion, which we expect will be completed within previously established reserves. We are also working on four other projects. As part of our continued efforts on these four projects, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined it was likely that the parties that were contractually obligated to remediate contamination resulting from prior use of PCE and other contaminants at three of these previously purchased locations would not be able to continue to meet these obligations because of their respective financial condition. These projects relate to acquisitions which date as far back as the 1970s; the most recent one was in 2007. As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a charge of $3.9 million to increase our remediation-related reserves for these projects to $4.7 million as of June 27, 2015. As of July 2, 2016 our remediation-related reserves were approximately $3.6 million as discussed in Note 12, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn order to determine whether any additional exposure for remediation exists, commencing in fiscal year 2016, we assessed six additional sites which we previously acquired and that had historical dry cleaning operations. The environmental assessment of four of these sites is complete, with no further action required. We continue to assess the remaining two sites. With respect to these remaining two sites, while we believe additional costs may be probable, they are not yet reasonably estimable. Therefore, beyond amounts to cover our ongoing assessments of these two sites, we have not recorded any additional reserves for these properties.\nOur ongoing assessments will inform our next set of actions and could reveal other environmental contamination that needs to be remediated. We may incur additional charges to remediate at these sites. Further, based on information currently available, it is possible that we may incur additional losses in excess of established reserves for other environmental matters. While such charges may be significant, we believe the likelihood that any charges will have a material adverse effect on our results of ongoing operations or financial position is remote, although the charges in any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies, the imposition of clean-up obligations and the discovery of alleged contamination or changes out of our control. However, these amounts are not estimable at this time. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nUnder environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials. While we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions, we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods, nor can we give any assurance that existing remediation projects or future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to regulatory or third-party actions, including third party suits.\nAdditionally, we must maintain compliance with various permits and licenses issued to us in connection with our operations, or we must apply for and obtain such permits and licenses. Any failure on our part to maintain such compliance or to apply for and receive such permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at a particular location.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nWe rely upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as strong security procedures and tools, to operate our business and ensure the secure storage and transmission of information. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, computer networks\nand the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access to and/or use of sensitive data. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, or error or misconduct by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or to sabotage computer systems, change frequently, it may be difficult to detect the use of such techniques immediately and we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff, or using stolen credit cards to purchase goods. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, none of which have materially impacted our operations or financial results.\nAlthough we maintain a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation. Depending on the severity, any of these events could adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced, and the cost of those products, could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of these products is an important factor in our financial performance. We endeavor that all of our suppliers comply with applicable laws, including, without limitation, labor and environmental laws. Our ability to secure and maintain qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner can be a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial stability of suppliers, failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, United States and Canadian foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Our continued compliance with the disclosure requirements relating to the sourcing of so-called conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain other adjoining countries as required by the Dodd-Frank Act is predicated upon the timely receipt of accurate information from suppliers, who may be unwilling or unable to provide us with the relevant information. As a result, these requirements could adversely affect our costs, the availability of materials used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operating results.\nFluctuations in demand for our products and services may adversely impact our financial results.\nContinued uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. This could negatively impact our customers and consequently have a negative impact on our financial performance. If demand for our products and services fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our revenue and operating margin could be negatively impacted. Important factors that could cause demand for our products and services to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nchanges in business and economic conditions, including downturns in specific industry segments and/or the overall economy;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market, expectations for inflation and energy prices;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures, including pricing pressures, from companies that have competing products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer needs;\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers' employment levels, which impact the number of users of our products and services;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions taken by our competitors; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products and services.\nIf our customers' demand for our products and services decreases, our plant and manufacturing capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to record an impairment of our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, as well as\nintangible assets, which would increase our expenses. A change in demand for our products and services, and changes in our customers' needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our costs and lower our gross margin percentage.\nLegal proceedings may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time we are party to various legal claims and proceedings, including those relating to employment and regulatory matters. Certain of these claims or proceedings or potential future proceedings, if decided adversely against us or settled by us, may result in a liability that is material to our financial condition and operating results. We discuss current lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 12, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks associated with our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our operating results.\nHistorically, a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions. We continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. The failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreases in fuel, energy and commodity costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMotor fuel, natural gas, electricity, cotton, polyester and other commodities represent a significant cost within our business. The price of these commodities, which are required to run our vehicles and equipment and manufacture our garments, can be unpredictable and can fluctuate based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by oil and gas producers, war, terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters and environmental concerns. Increases in the cost of these commodities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to preserve positive labor relationships could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nSignificant portions of our Canadian labor force are unionized, and a lesser portion of United States employees are unionized. While we believe that our Canadian and U.S. employee relations are good, we continue to face pressure from labor unions, and could experience increased pressure. If we do encounter pressure from labor unions, any resulting labor unrest could disrupt our business by impairing our ability to produce and deliver our products and services. In addition, significant union representation would require us to negotiate with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results by restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nInability to attract and retain employees could adversely impact our operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain employees is important to our operations. Our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. In the event of a labor shortage, or in the event of a change in prevailing labor and/or immigration laws, we could experience difficulty in delivering our services in a high-quality or timely manner and we could be forced to increase wages in order to attract and retain employees, which would result in higher operating costs.\nLoss of our key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.\nOur success is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management and other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executives or key personnel were not to remain active in our company, or if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nUnexpected events, including, without limitation, fires at facilities, security breaches, cyber attacks, natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornados, public health emergencies, war or terrorist activities, unplanned utility outages, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our business, could adversely affect our operating results. These events could result in disruption of customer service, physical damage or temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities, or the temporary disruption of information systems.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. While we continue to evaluate our internal controls,\nwe cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we will not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent or detect fraud. This may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nFailure to execute our business plan could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nSuccessful execution of our business plan is not assured as there are several obstacles to success, including the economic environment, a competitive industry and entries by us into new markets. In addition, there can be no assurance that our efforts, if properly executed, will result in our desired outcome of improved financial performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO MERGER\nOur proposed merger may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to complete or delays in completing the merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nOn August 16, 2016, we announced that we entered into a merger agreement (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Cintas Corporation and Bravo Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), which provides that Cintas will acquire all of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock at a price of $97.50 per share in cash. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the company (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with the company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas. The Merger is subject to a number of customary conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the approval of our shareholders and receipt of regulatory approvals, which are not within our control. We can provide no assurance as to when, or if, the conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived, that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the termination of the Merger, or that the Merger will be consummated or consummated in the timeframe or manner currently anticipated.\nAny delay in closing or a failure to close could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and stock price as well as our relationships with our customers, suppliers or employees, and a negative impact on our ability to pursue alternative strategic transactions and/or our ability to implement alternative business plans.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay Cintas Corporation a termination fee.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from initiating, soliciting, or knowingly facilitating or encouraging any inquiries or making of proposals or offers with regard to any inquiry, proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal or participating in any negotiations, discussions or furnishing any non-public information in connection therewith. If we receive a competing acquisition proposal and our board (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) determines that such proposal is more favorable to our shareholders than the Merger and the board recommends such proposal to our shareholders, Cintas may be entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement. Under such circumstances, we may be required to pay Cintas a termination fee equal to $60 million. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the company from considering or proposal that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to enter into a transaction that would be more favorable to us and our shareholders than the Merger.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely impacted during the pendency of the Merger.\nThe announcement of the proposed Merger, whether or not consummated, may cause disruptions to our business or business relationships and create uncertainty surrounding our ongoing business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price, including as a result of the following (all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger):\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may be directed to transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations of our business;\n\u2022\nour employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key personnel and other employees;\n\u2022\nour relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, regulators and other third parties with which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty prior to the closing of the Merger and seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to terminate or re-negotiate their relationships with us; and\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement restricts us from engaging in certain actions without the consent of Cintas, which may affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals, including continuing efforts to\ntransform our business in accordance with strategic goals established by our management and could prevent us from pursuing opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether or not the Merger is consummated.\nLegal proceedings may be filed against the Board in connection with the Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain and could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger.\nLegal proceedings may be filed by our shareholders against us or our board that challenge the proposed Merger. Among other remedies, these shareholders could seek to enjoin the merger. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. Such potential lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger from becoming effective within the anticipated timeframe and may result in substantial costs to us.\nWe have incurred and will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger.\nWe will incur substantial expenses in connection with completing the Merger. A portion of the transaction costs related to the Merger will be incurred regardless of whether the Merger is completed. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation prior to the Merger.", "PERMNO": 37955, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "GK"}
