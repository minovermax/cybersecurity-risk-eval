{"cik": "1418100", "company": "Avaya Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe risk factors summarized and detailed below could materially harm our business, operating results and/or financial condition, impair our future prospects and/or cause the price of our common stock to decline. These are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, those relating to:\nRisks Related to our Business\n\u2022executing our strategic operating plan, including our strategic partnership with Ring Central, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022shifting more of our business to a subscription-based operating expense model which may harm our cash flows;\n\u2022the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic and other future epidemics and public health crises\u037e\n\u2022completing acquisitions and/or strategic alliances, including those needed to increase our share of the cloud communications industry and integrating such acquired businesses and alliances\u037e\n\u2022market opportunities may not develop for our solutions and services in ways that we anticipate and we may not succeed in developing new innovative solutions and services to keep pace with rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and customer preferences;\n\u2022industry consolidation and competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions;\n\u2022our ability to continue to expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings;\n\u2022our reliance on our indirect sales channel;\n\u2022disruptions to our third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers;\n\u2022changes in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, performance and pricing of contracts with government entities;\n\u2022 the ability to detect and correct design defects, errors, failures or \u201cbugs\u201d in our products and services;\n\u2022disruptions to our business due to catastrophic disasters or events, including health epidemics;\n\u2022protection of our proprietary rights to our intellectual property;\n\u2022some of our products contain software from open source code sources;\n\u2022litigation, intellectual property, infringement claims and the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations related to data privacy and protection;\n\u2022security breaches of our information systems, products or services or of the information systems of our third-party providers;\n\u2022operational, logistical, economic and/or political challenges in a specific country or region, which could negatively affect our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition or those of our channel partners and distributors;\n\u2022compliance with certain telecommunications or other rules and regulations, which could subject us to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. and foreign government laws and regulations, including environmental, health, safety and data privacy laws and regulations and economic sanctions\u037e\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\n\u2022our revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance;\n\u2022shifts in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solutions or the mix of products, solutions and services purchased by our customers could affect our gross margins and operating results;\n\u2022not realizing the expected benefit from cost-reduction initiatives;\n\u2022we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired;\n\u2022our degree of leverage;\n\u2022restrictions included in our financing agreements and indentures;\n\u2022our ability to service all of our indebtedness and other ongoing liquidity needs and to raise additional capital to fund our operations;\n\u2022the price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially;\n\u2022potential for significantly dilutive issuance of common stock, including upon the conversion of our convertible notes and preferred stock;\n\u2022our intention not to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future; and\n\u2022the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain consent rights over charter amendments and issuances of senior equity and they may exercise their redemption or put rights.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur Operations, Markets and Competition\nIf we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan, or if our strategic operating plan is flawed, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nEach year, we develop our strategic operating plan that serves as a roadmap for implementing our business strategy and the basis for the allocation of resources, capital, investment decisions, product life cycles, process improvements and strategic alliances and acquisitions. In developing the strategic plan, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to the market environment, customer demand, evolving technologies, competition, market consolidation, the global economy and our overall strategic priorities for the upcoming fiscal year. We sell business communications solutions and services in markets where the technology available and the utilized go-to-market models are rapidly changing. Actual economic, market and other conditions may be different from our assumptions and we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic operating plan. Moreover, because we deliver sophisticated products and solutions, our sales process for a portion of our business is complex, lengthy and complicated. If we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan, or if actual results vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Potential adverse impacts include, but are not limited to, investments made in research and development that do not develop into commercially successful products, operating inefficiencies, unsuccessful strategic alliances or acquisitions or lower revenues due to our sales focus being misaligned with customer demand or an inability to compete effectively against competitors. In addition, unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a significant effect on our ability to execute our strategic plan.\nThe timing of our cash flows may be negatively impacted as we shift more of our business to a subscription-based model.\nWe intend to increase our recurring revenue by shifting more of our business to a subscription-based model instead of a perpetual license model. To do this, we need to offer relevant cloud-enabled unified communications and contact center solutions and services at competitive prices, which will both attract new customers and which we can bundle and upsell to existing customers. If we successfully increase our subscription revenues, we expect that it will result in more of our cash receipts being deferred relative to our historical perpetual license model as payments are spread over a pre-determined time period (e.g. monthly or annually) rather than being received upfront.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the responses of governments worldwide to COVID-19, are having a negative impact on regional, national and global economies, disrupting supply chains and reducing international trade and business activity. The pandemic has caused many governments throughout the world to implement stay-at-home orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel and other social distancing measures including restrictions that prohibit many employees from commuting to their customary work locations and require these employees to work remotely if possible. Many of these restrictions have remained in place for months and in light of recent resurgences in the outbreak may continue in one fashion or another for the foreseeable future.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Our ability to operate, as well as our partners\u2019 and/or customers\u2019 ability to operate in affected areas, has been and may continue to be hindered, which may cause our business and operating results to decline.\n\u2022The inability of our employees to access customers\u2019 sites has and will continue to hinder our ability to offer services that can only be provided on site, as well as our ability to make in person sales visits and demonstrations.\n\u2022Clients and customers have had and may continue to have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us, resulting in late or non-payment of amounts owed.\n\u2022We may experience significant reductions or volatility in demand for our solutions as customers may not be able to enter into new purchase commitments or otherwise invest in their business due to financial downturns or general economic uncertainty.\n\u2022We may experience temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain, which may significantly impact our distribution network, results of operations (including sales) or business.\n\u2022The effects of shelter-in-place orders may negatively disrupt our business as a number of our employees, customers and partners, work remotely, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.\n\u2022To the extent a number of our employees, including our executive officers and other members of our management team, are impacted in significant numbers by the outbreak of the pandemic and are not available to conduct work, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022We may not be able to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations and crisis management plans are not effective or are improperly implemented.\n\u2022The significant disruption of global financial markets, which has impacted the value of our common stock and could further materially impact the value of our stock in the future, may reduce our ability to access further capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and could affect our business in the near and long-term.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial performance and liquidity, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, as well the timing of the development of vaccines and other therapeutic measures, none of which can be predicted. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Some economists are predicting that the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of the actions by governments to slow the spread of the disease will be steep and severe. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including government stimulus efforts, is not assured. Additionally, as pandemic conditions wane, we cannot predict how quickly the marketplaces in which we operate will return to normal.\nFurthermore, our business could be adversely affected in the future by the effects of other health epidemics and the widespread outbreak of different contagious diseases other than COVID-19. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include supply-chain disruptions, restrictions on our ability to distribute our products and restrictions on our abilities to provide services in the regions affected. Any prolonged and significant supply-chain disruptions or inability to provide products or services would likely impact our sales in the affected region, increase our costs and negatively affect our operating results. In addition, as we have seen in fiscal 2020, a significant outbreak of a contagious disease in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services and likely impact our operating results.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete acquisitions and/or strategic alliances, including those needed to increase our share of the cloud communications market, so that we may accelerate the execution of our growth strategy.\nOur strategic operating plan requires continued investments in acquisitions and strategic alliances with other companies in various areas, specifically, with respect to, accelerating the development, sales and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and services. Identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives and/or partners may be time consuming and divert the attention and focus of management and other key personnel. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses as part of that process. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including among other things, economic conditions, market consolidation, industry trends and competing bidders. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any acquisition or strategic alliance even if we expend significant sums and efforts in connection with a potential transaction. Without such transactions it may be challenging for us to execute on our strategic operating plan in our desired time frame and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur strategic operating plan relies in part upon the successful execution of our strategic partnership with RingCentral, Inc. (\"RingCentral\"), which may not be successful.\nOur strategy relies on market acceptance of our cloud-based solutions and investing in being at the forefront of offering these solutions. Our ability to implement this strategy relies, at least in part, on our strategic partnership with RingCentral. A strategic partnership between two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process that will require significant management attention and resources. Realizing the benefits of our strategic partnership with RingCentral will depend in part on our ability to work with RingCentral to develop, market and sell Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral (\"Avaya Cloud Office\" or \"ACO\"). Setting up the operations and processes under which we and RingCentral will work together may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, would limit the expected benefits to us. While the efforts of our strategic partnership and the launch of ACO has been successful to date, this alliance is still in a nascent stage and unforeseen challenges may arise, which could impact the ultimate benefits achieved from the alliance. In addition, the process of bringing ACO to market in additional countries may take longer than anticipated, which could negate some of our anticipated benefits and revenue opportunities.\nThe failure to meet the challenges involved in having two businesses work together could harm our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of this partnership and cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities in a way that could adversely affect our results of operations. Due to this, as well as the potential that we may incur significant costs\nassociated with this partnership but our revenues may not increase as anticipated, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to integrate acquired businesses effectively, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur strategic operating plan requires continued investments in acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Intellisist, Inc. (d/b/a Spoken), a U.S. based private technology company, which provides cloud-based CCaaS solutions and customer experience management and automation applications, in March 2018. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and, where desired, their product portfolios into ours, resulting in the failure to realize the intended benefits. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions or product portfolios, or if they fail to perform as we anticipate, our existing businesses and our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. If the due diligence of the operations and customer arrangements of acquired businesses performed by us and by third parties on our behalf is inadequate or flawed, or if we later discover unforeseen financial or business liabilities, acquired businesses and their assets may not perform as expected or we may come to realize that our initial investment was too large or unwarranted. Additionally, acquisitions could result in difficulties integrating acquired operations and, where deemed desirable, transitioning overlapping products into a single product line, thereby resulting in the diversion of capital and the attention of management and other key personnel away from other business issues and opportunities. We may fail to retain employees acquired through acquisitions, which may negatively impact our integration efforts. Consequently, the failure to integrate acquired businesses effectively may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe market opportunity for business communications solutions and services may not develop in the ways that we anticipate, and we may not succeed in developing new, innovative solutions and services, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe demand for our solutions and services can change quickly and in ways that we may not anticipate because the market in which we operate is characterized by rapid, and sometimes disruptive, technological developments, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and a limited ability to accurately forecast future customer orders. Our operating results may be adversely affected if the market opportunity for our solutions and services does not develop in the ways that we anticipate or if other technologies become more accepted or standard in our industry or disrupt our technology platforms.\nOur solutions and services may fail to keep pace with rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and customer preferences.\nBoth traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in our markets and competing for customers. As next-generation business communications technology continues to evolve, including, without limitation, cloud-based communications solutions, we must keep pace in order to maintain or expand our market leading position. We are increasingly focused on new, high value software solutions to drive revenue. If we are not able to successfully develop and bring these new solutions to market in a timely manner, achieve market acceptance of our solutions and services or identify new market opportunities for our solutions and services, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our solutions need to keep pace with new smart devices and the release of new operating systems so that our customers may continue to use and manage our cloud-based solutions on smart devices. The creation, support and maintenance of our mobile applications may require significant resources and requires us to maintain good relations with the application developers and users. If we are unable to support the mobile platforms which our customers use or maintain good working relationships with these developers and users, our growth, business and operating results may be impacted.\nWe face formidable competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions, and this competition may negatively impact our business and limit our growth.\nThe markets for our solutions and services are characterized by rapid changes in customer demands, ongoing technological changes, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Both traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in this market and competing for customers. As these markets evolve, we expect competition to intensify and to expand to include companies that do not currently compete against us.\nBecause we offer solutions for contact centers and unified communications which are cloud-based, on-premise or hybrid, we face a wide range of competitors. Some of our competitors include:\n\u2022Enterprise UCC: Cisco, Microsoft, NEC, Atos Unify, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise and Huawei.\n\u2022Midmarket UCC: Mitel, NEC, Cisco and Microsoft.\n\u2022Cloud Products and Services: Cisco, Microsoft, RingCentral, 8x8, Mitel, Google, LogMeIn, Fuze, Zoom and Twilio.\n\u2022Video Products and Solutions: Cisco, Microsoft, Zoom, LogMeIn, Google, Poly, Huawei, ZTE, RingCentral, BlueJeans and LifeSize.\n\u2022Enterprise Contact Center Products and Services: Genesys, Cisco, Aspect Software, Huawei, NEC and Enghouse Interactive.\n\u2022Midmarket Contact Center Products and Services: Genesys, Cisco, Five9, NICE InContact, Amazon, Twilio, Talkdesk and Vonage.\nWe also face competition in certain geographies with companies that have a particular strength and focus in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, such as Huawei in China and Intelbras in Latin America.\nSeveral of our existing competitors have, and many of our future competitors may have, greater financial, personnel, technical, R&D and other resources, more well-established brands or reputations and broader customer bases than we do and, as a result, these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. On the other hand, smaller competitors may be able to respond to technological evolution and changes in customer demand with more speed and agility than we can. In addition, some competitors may have customer bases that are more geographically balanced than ours and, therefore, may be less affected by an economic downturn in a particular region. Other companies may have relationships with channel partners, distributors, resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and/or network service providers which pose a competitive threat to us. Moreover, other competitors may have deeper expertise in a particular stand-alone technology that develops more quickly than we anticipate. Competitors with greater resources may also be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or other incentives that we cannot match or do not offer.\nIn addition, because the business communications market continues to evolve and technology continues to develop rapidly, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete against us, but whose current business activities may bring them into competition with us in the future. In particular, this may be the case as business, information technology and communications applications deployed on converged networks become more integrated to support business communications. We may face increased competition from current leaders in IT infrastructure, consumer products, personal and business applications and the software that connects the network infrastructure to those applications. With respect to services, we may also face competition from companies that seek to sell remotely hosted services or software as a service directly to end customers. Competition from these potential market entrants may take many forms, including offering products and solutions similar to those that we offer. In addition, certain of these technologies continue to move from a proprietary environment to an open standards-based environment.\nWe cannot predict which competitors may enter our markets, what forms such competition may take or whether we will be able to respond effectively to new competitors or to the rapid evolution in technology and product development that has characterized our businesses. In addition, in order to effectively compete with any new technology or a new market entrant, we may need to make additional investments in our business, use more capital resources than our business currently requires or reduce prices, any of which may materially and adversely affect particular parts of our business, or our business as a whole.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to stronger competition and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the markets in which we compete and companies which provide unified communications are purchasing contact center providers. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in an evolving market and as companies are acquired or sell businesses because they are unable to continue all or a portion of their operations. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. Furthermore, rapid consolidation, particularly in the value-added reseller (\u201cVAR\u201d) and service provider markets, will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on our business.\nWe also believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to continue to expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings and grow our share of the cloud communications market for such offerings through customer acceptance.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is our ability to significantly increase revenues generated from sales of our cloud-based communications solutions and related services. To increase our revenue, we must continue to expand and develop new cloud-based solutions and services offerings as the market rapidly develops and changes. Our cloud enabled unified communications and contact center solutions and services must offer relevant features and provide consistent high-quality services at competitive prices to attract new customers and to migrate existing customers to such solutions and services. While\nwe have entered into a strategic partnership with RingCentral that enhances our cloud-based offerings, there is no assurance that this partnership will provide us with the desired long-term growth opportunities and results as there are a number of dependencies, including customer acceptance of ACO.\nThe cloud communications industry is competitive and rapidly evolving, and we expect competition to increase. The functionality, relevance and customer acceptance of our cloud-based solutions and services will depend, in part, on our ability and our partners' ability to integrate these with third-party applications and platforms, including enterprise collaboration, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, human capital management and other proprietary application suites.\nAs is typical of any new solution introduced in a rapidly evolving market, the level of demand for, and market acceptance of these new solutions is uncertain. If we successfully expand and develop our cloud-based solutions and services, including, without limitation, Avaya OneCloud Private and Avaya Cloud Office, our business will remain dependent on customer decisions to migrate their legacy communications infrastructures to cloud solutions based on newer technology. While these investment decisions are often driven by macroeconomic factors, customers may also delay the purchase of newer technology due to a range of other factors, including prioritization of other IT projects, delays or failures to meet customers' certification requirements, the weighing of the costs and benefits of deploying new infrastructures and devices and the need to deploy capital to respond to unforeseen circumstances, such as COVID-19. In addition, customers\u2019 focus on the architecture, management and integration of such new technologies, possible cyber breaches and other security considerations could also affect market acceptance of new solutions. If the market for cloud-based communications fails to develop, develops more slowly than we anticipate, or develops in a manner different than we expect, or if we are not able to successfully develop and expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings, our cloud-based solutions and services could fail to achieve market acceptance, which in turn could impact our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur strategy depends in part on our reliance on our indirect sales channel.\nAn important element of our go-to-market strategy to expand sales coverage, penetrate new markets and increase market absorption of new solutions is the use of our global network of alliance partners, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, telecommunications service providers and system integrators, who are collectively referred to as our \"channel partners\". Our financial results could be adversely affected if our relationships with these channel partners were to deteriorate, if our support pricing or other services strategies conflict with those of our channel partners, if any of our competitors were to enter into strategic relationships with or acquire any of our channel partners, if some or all of our channel partners do not become enabled to sell new solutions and services or if the financial condition of some or all of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, we may expend time, money and other resources on developing and maintaining channel relationships that are ultimately unsuccessful. Furthermore, despite the benefits of a robust indirect channel, our channel partners have direct contact with our customers, which may foster independent relationships between them and may lead to a loss of certain services agreements for us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing relationships with channel partners. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers or market share. Although the terms of individual channel partner agreements may deviate from our standard program terms, our standard program agreements for resellers generally provide for a term of one year with automatic renewals for successive one-year terms and generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 30 days' notice. Our standard program agreements for distributors generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days' prior written notice. Certain of our contractual agreements with our largest distributors and resellers, however, permit termination of the relationship by either party for convenience upon prior notice of 180 days. In addition, our alliance partners (including RingCentral), distributors and resellers are permitted to work with other vendors, including our competitors, and most of them do so. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Alliances and Partnerships\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our global channel partner program and the standard terms of our program agreements.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers. If these relationships are disrupted and we are unable to obtain substitute manufacturers, suppliers or partners, on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers produce the vast majority of our products in facilities located in southern China, with other products manufactured in facilities located in Mexico, Taiwan, Germany, Ireland and the U.S. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs furnished or approved by us and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may be necessary or appropriate. Although we closely manage the transition process when manufacturing changes are required, we\ncould experience disruption to our operations during any such transition. Any such disruption could negatively affect our reputation and our operating results. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components and resell them separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand. In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited source of suppliers. These sole source and limited source suppliers may stop selling their components at commercially reasonable prices or at all. Interruptions, delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations. We may not be able to make scheduled product deliveries to our customers in a timely fashion. We could incur significant costs to redesign our products or to qualify alternative suppliers, which would reduce our realized margins. We have also outsourced substantially all of our warehousing and distribution logistics operations to several providers of such services on a global basis, and any delays or material changes in such services could cause significant disruption to our operations. If any of our providers of outsourced services were to experience financial difficulty or seek protection under bankruptcy laws it could also affect their ability to perform services for us.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including hosting partners and providers of other cloud-based services. If these third-party providers do not perform as expected, our customers may be adversely affected, resulting in potential liability and negative exposure for us. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers due to poor performance, cyber breaches or other security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time and expense to us, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has adopted a new approach to trade policy, including in some cases renegotiating and terminating certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The U.S. government has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods from a variety of countries and regions, most notably China, and has raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases or expanding the tariffs to capture other types of goods. In response, many of these foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the U.S. Changes in U.S. trade policy have and may continue to result in one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products from those countries. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers, which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. or other countries will impose new or additional quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of our products in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nContracting with government entities can be complex, expensive and time-consuming.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company\u2019s revenue from contracts including the U.S. federal government was approximately $230 million. The procurement process for government entities is in many ways more challenging than contracting in the private sector. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, performance and pricing of contracts with government entities, including U.S. federal, state and local governmental bodies. These laws and regulations may impose added costs on our business or prolong or complicate our sales efforts, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations or other applicable requirements could lead to claims for damages from our customers, penalties, termination of contracts and other adverse consequences. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with government entities could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGovernment entities often require highly specialized contract terms that may differ from our standard arrangements. Government entities often impose compliance requirements that are complicated, require preferential pricing or \u201cmost favored nation\u201d terms and conditions, or are otherwise time-consuming and expensive to satisfy. Compliance with these special standards or satisfaction of such requirements could complicate our efforts to obtain business or increase the cost of doing so. Even if we do meet these special standards or requirements, the increased costs associated with providing our solutions to government customers could harm our margins.\nBusiness communications solutions are complex, and design defects, errors, failures or \"bugs\" may be difficult to detect and correct and could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and cause us to lose customers.\nBusiness communications products are complex, integrating hardware, software and many elements of a customer\u2019s existing network and communications infrastructure. Despite testing conducted prior to the release of solutions to the market and quality assurance programs, hardware may malfunction and software may contain \"bugs\" that are difficult to detect and fix. Any such\nissues could interfere with the expected operation of a solution, which might negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins.\nDepending upon the size and scope of any such issue, remediation may have a material impact on our business. Our inability to cure an application or product defect, should one occur, could result in the failure of an application or product line, the temporary or permanent withdrawal from an application, product or market, damage to our reputation, an increase in inventory costs, an increase in warranty claims, lawsuits by customers or customers\u2019 or channel partners\u2019 end users, or application or product reengineering expenses. Our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover claims that are successfully asserted against us.\nIntellectual Property and Information Security\nWe are dependent on our intellectual property. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business is primarily dependent on our technology and our ability to innovate in business communications and, as a result, we are reliant on our intellectual property. We generally protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other measures to the extent our budget permits. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications that we have filed or that our patents will be sufficient to protect our key technology from misappropriation or falling into the public domain, nor can assurances be made that any of our patents, patent applications, trademarks or our other intellectual property or proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, our business is global and the level of protection of our proprietary technology varies by country and may be particularly uncertain in countries that do not have well developed judicial systems or laws that adequately protect intellectual property rights. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents and other proprietary rights are costly and unpredictable and may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area. Financial considerations also preclude us from seeking patent protection in every country where infringement litigation could arise and a cost-benefit analysis may lead us to conclude that under certain circumstances enforcing our rights does not merit the expending of efforts and capital. Our inability to predict our intellectual property requirements in all geographies and affordability constraints also impact our intellectual property protection investment decisions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who do not incur the substantial time and expense we incur to create our products.\nPreventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. Moreover, it may be difficult or practically impossible to detect theft, unauthorized use of our intellectual property or the production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products and solutions. For example, we actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights and we actively pursue counterfeiters and their distributors, but we nonetheless may lose revenue due to illegal or unauthorized use of our software. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our solutions due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions being successful against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nIn addition, our business is global and the level of protection of our proprietary technology varies by country and may be particularly uncertain in countries that do not have well developed judicial systems or laws that adequately protect intellectual property rights. The level of protection afforded our intellectual property may also be particularly uncertain in countries that require the transfer of technology as a condition to market access. Our partnerships with foreign entities sometimes require us to transfer technology and/or certain intellectual property rights in countries that afford less protection of intellectual property rights than other countries. While we believe such technology and intellectual property transfer requirements have not adversely affected our business, such requirements may change over time and become detrimental to our ability to protect our technology or intellectual property in certain foreign countries. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents and other proprietary rights are costly and unpredictable and may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area. Financial considerations also preclude us from seeking patent protection in every country where infringement litigation could arise. Our inability to predict our intellectual property requirements in all geographies and affordability constraints also impact our intellectual property protection investment decisions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who do not incur the substantial time and expense we incur to create our products.\nCertain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances, may lead to unintended consequences and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSome of our products contain software from open source code sources. The use of such open source code may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer our products that use open source code to third parties for no cost. We monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. However, the use of such open source code may ultimately subject some of our products to unintended conditions, which could require us to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts and, therefore, could materially adversely affect\nour business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices and claims from third parties asserting that our proprietary or licensed products, systems and software infringe their intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the number of these notices and claims will not increase in the future or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights. Irrespective of the merits of these claims, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. These matters may result in any number of outcomes for us, including entering into licensing agreements, redesigning our products to avoid infringement, being enjoined from selling products or solutions that are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others, paying damages if products are found to infringe and indemnifying customers from infringement claims as part of our contractual obligations. Royalty or license agreements may be very costly and we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Such agreements may cause operating margins to decline.\nIn addition, some of our employees previously have been employed at other companies that provide similar products and services. We may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. These claims and other claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have made and will likely continue to make investments to license and/or acquire the use of third-party intellectual property rights and technology as part of our strategy to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any costs relating to such activity will not be material. We may also be subject to additional notice, attribution and other compliance requirements to the extent we incorporate open source software into our applications. In addition, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that a customer\u2019s use of our products, systems or software infringes the third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to indemnify our customers for some of the costs and damages related to such an infringement claim. Any indemnification requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, any insurance that we have may not be sufficient to cover all amounts related to such indemnification.\nFailure to comply with laws and contractual obligations related to data privacy and protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign governmental agencies, including the European Union's (\"EU\") GDPR and California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Data privacy and protection is highly regulated and GDPR imposes new obligations on companies, including us, who process personal data of data subjects who are in the EU, regardless of whether or not that processing takes place in the EU. These requirements substantially increase potential liability for all such companies for failure to comply with data protection rules.\nPrivacy laws restrict our storage, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and protection of personal information, including credit card data, provided to us by our customers as well as data we collect from our customers and employees. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. Our privacy compliance program is based on our binding corporate rules which have been approved by EU regulatory authorities. Through the application of these rules we endeavor to apply uniform data handling practices, based on GDPR standards, on a global basis throughout all Avaya entities which process personal data, which entities have signed on to our binding corporate rules. We have dedicated significant time, capital and other resources to obtain binding corporate rules and meet GDPR requirements, as well as requirements from other laws such as CCPA. We expect that as privacy laws continue to evolve and become more prevalent throughout the world, we will be required to dedicate additional resources to ensure compliance.\nFrom time to time we have notified the Hessen authorities, our lead supervisory authority in the EU, of certain personal data breaches and privacy issues. If the authorities determine that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties and lawsuits, and our reputation may suffer. In particular, fines imposed on other companies by various data privacy regulatory authorities from the EU for violations of the GDPR have been significant in amount. Furthermore, we may be subject to increased scrutiny going forward and we may also be required to make modifications to our data practices that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThese data privacy risks are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. We believe that regulation will continue to increase around the world with respect to the solicitation, collection, processing, and/or use of personal, financial, and consumer information. In addition, the interpretation and application of existing consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere is often uncertain and in\nflux. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe are also subject to the privacy and data protection-related obligations in our contracts with our customers, channel partners and other third parties. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data or consumer protection, or to comply with our contractual obligations related to privacy, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation. Additionally, third parties on which we rely enter into contracts to protect and safeguard our customers' data. Should such parties violate these agreements or suffer a security breach, we could be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation.\nA breach of the security of our information systems, products or services or of the information systems of our third-party providers could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on the security of our information systems and, in certain circumstances, those of our third-party providers, such as channel partners, vendors, consultants and contract manufacturers, to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. In addition, the growth of bring your own device (\"BYOD\") programs has heightened the need for enhanced security measures. IT security system failures, including a breach of our or our third-party providers\u2019 data security, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders, disruptions in the manufacture or shipment of products or delivery of services or an unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information. Additionally, despite our security procedures or those of our third-party providers, information systems and our products and services may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, modify or delete our or our customers\u2019 proprietary information. In recent years, these attacks and similar threats have become more sophisticated and numerous and we expect that trend to continue.\nWe take cybersecurity seriously and devote significant resources and tools to protect our systems, products and data from unwanted intrusions and to ensure we meet our contractual and regulatory obligations. However, these security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent, detect and adequately address or mitigate such cyber-attacks or security breaches. We investigate potential data breach issues identified through our security procedures and terminate, mitigate and remediate such issues as appropriate. Past incidents have involved outside actors and internal issues stemming from certain configuration and migration issues of our internal applications to other platforms. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of business communications products and services and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems regardless of whether we or our third-party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure. In addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection worldwide, such as the European GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, may increase the costs to develop, implement or secure our products and services. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. Furthermore, we may need to increase or change our cybersecurity systems and expenditures to support expansion of sales into new industry segments or new geographic markets. If we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain data hosting services to us or to our customers, and interruptions or delays in those services could harm our business.\nOur cloud-based solutions rely on uninterrupted connection to the Internet through data centers and networks. To provide such service for our customers, we utilize data center hosting facilities located in the United States and Europe, as well as in our Asia Pacific region and our Central America and Latin America region. We also use facilities provided by Google, Amazon and Microsoft as we migrate to cloud solutions. We do not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to service interruptions or damage from floods, earthquakes, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to acts of vandalism or terrorism, sabotage, similar misconduct and/or human error. Moreover, if any of these data centers and networks cease operations, we would need to migrate our solutions and our customers to other providers. The occurrence of these or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the ability to use our solutions efficiently or at all, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGlobal Operations and Regulations\nSince we operate internationally, operational, logistical, economic and/or political challenges in a specific country or region could negatively affect our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition or those of our channel partners and distributors.\nWe do business in approximately 190 countries. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations and significant amounts of our R&D activities in countries outside of the U.S., and we also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers and our channel partners. For fiscal 2020, we derived 43% of our revenue from sales outside of the U.S., with the most significant portions generated from Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. In addition, we intend to continue to grow our business internationally. The vast majority of our contract manufacturing also takes place outside the U.S., primarily in southern China.\nAccordingly, our results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors relating to international business operations, including:\n\u2022economic conditions and geopolitical developments, including trade sanctions, changes to significant trading relationships such as the United Kingdom\u2019s ongoing process of withdrawal from the EU, and the negotiation of new or revised international trade arrangements;\n\u2022political or social unrest, economic instability or corruption or sovereign debt risks in a specific country or region;\n\u2022legal and regulatory constraints, such as international and local laws and regulations related to trade compliance, anti-corruption, information security, data privacy and protection, labor and other requirements;\n\u2022protectionist and local security legislation;\n\u2022difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, such as protecting against the counterfeiting of our products;\n\u2022less established legal and judicial systems necessary to enforce our rights;\n\u2022relationships with employees and works councils, as well as difficulties in finding qualified employees, including skilled design and technical employees, as companies expand their operations offshore;\n\u2022unfavorable tax and currency regulations;\n\u2022military conflict, terrorist activities and health pandemics or similar issues;\n\u2022future government shutdowns or uncertainties which could affect the portion of our revenues which comes from the U.S. federal government sector;\n\u2022natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods, anywhere we and/or our channel partners and distributors have business operations; and\n\u2022other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we and our contract manufacturers and business partners currently operate or intend to operate, including in the U.S.\nAny or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, the various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and they may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. Furthermore, our prospective effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.\nIf we do not comply with certain telecommunications or other rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services.\nCertain of our cloud-based communications and collaboration solutions are regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Communications Commission and various state and local agencies, and across the globe by governments of various foreign countries. Furthermore, we are subject to existing or potential regulations relating to privacy, protection of customer information, disability access, porting of numbers, Universal Service and Telecommunications Relay Service Fund contributions, emergency access, law enforcement intercept, and other requirements. In addition, government agencies in other countries impose their own regulatory requirements on those solutions. If we do not comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possible restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our solutions or requirements to modify certain solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, changes in telecommunications requirements, or\nregulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate now or in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, costs and other liabilities.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state, local and international governmental requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, lose customers and damage our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at off-site locations such as landfills. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.\nWe currently own or formerly owned several properties or facilities that for many years were used for industrial activities, including the manufacture of electronics equipment. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state or foreign laws. For example, we are presently involved in remediation efforts at several currently or formerly owned sites related to historical site use which we do not believe will have a material impact on our business or operations, although no assurance can be given that these remediation efforts or remediation efforts we are required to undertake in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations.\nWe are also subject to various local, federal and international laws and regulations regarding the materials content and electrical design of our products that require us to be financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products. For example, the EU has adopted the Restriction on Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, with similar laws and regulations being enacted in other regions. Since May 2014, the U.S. requires companies to publicly disclose their use of conflict minerals that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or an adjoining country. Additionally, requirements such as the EU Energy Labelling Directive, impose requirements relating to the energy efficiency of our products. Our failure or the undetected failure of our supply chain to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety requirements could subject us to liabilities exceeding our reserves or adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nA growing number of climate change regulations and initiatives are either in force or pending at the local, federal and international levels as part of a transition to a lower-carbon economy that is underway globally. With growing awareness of climate change, the demand for lower emissions products and services is increasing. As we continue to shift our products and services to the cloud, this creates an opportunity to serve customers' needs and requirements. The lower-carbon economy may also entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. Depending on the nature, speed and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to our organization. Our operations and supply chain could face increased climate change-related regulations, modifications to transportation to meet lower emission requirements, changes to types of materials used for products and packaging to reduce emissions, increased utility costs to address cleaner energy technologies, increased costs related to severe weather events, and emissions reductions associated with operations, business travel or products. These costs and changes to operations could have a financial impact on our business and result in an adverse impact on our operating results or reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\nFinancial Performance\nIn addition to experiencing some seasonal trends, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and the results of one period may not provide a reliable indicator of our future performance.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Fluctuations in our financial results from period to period are caused by many factors, including, but not limited to, the size and timing of new logos, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the mix of products sold by us and general economic conditions. In addition, execution of sales opportunities sometimes traverses from the intended fiscal quarter to the next.\nWe also experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition. Typically, our second fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the Company applied fresh start accounting upon its emergence from bankruptcy. As a result, assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value as of the Emergence Date. Accordingly, our financial condition and operating results after the Emergence Date are not comparable to the financial condition and operating results reflected in our historical Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Emergence Date.\nShifts in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solutions or changes in the components of our solutions purchased by our customers could affect our gross margins and operating results.\nOur gross margins and our operating results can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our solutions, including the sizes and types of organizations that purchase our solutions, the mix of software and hardware they purchase and the level of professional services and support they require. We provide our solutions to a broad range of companies, from small businesses to large multinational enterprises and government organizations. Sales to larger enterprises generally result in greater revenue but may take longer to negotiate and finalize than sales to small businesses. Conversely, sales to small businesses may be faster to execute than sales to larger enterprises, but they may involve greater credit risk and fewer opportunities to sell additional services. Moreover, an important element of our growth strategy is to continue to evolve from a traditional telecommunications hardware company into a software and services company, focused on expanding our cloud- and mobile-enabled contact center, unified communications and innovative next-generation workflow automation solutions. As we increase the proportion of our revenue coming from software solutions as opposed to hardware solutions, we expect to see improvement in our gross margins and operating results. Overall, if the mix of companies that purchase our solutions, or the mix of solution components purchased by our customers, changes unfavorably, our revenues and gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be harmed.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and derive all of our operating cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments or distributions to meet our obligations. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\nWe may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost-reduction initiatives.\nFrom time to time we may initiate cost savings programs designed to streamline operations. As discussed in Part II, Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations,\" we have initiated such programs historically, and we will continue to evaluate similar opportunities to the extent the business need arises. These types of cost-reduction activities are complex. Even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we expect, we may not be able to achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetables we anticipate. Any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and, as a result, our operations and business could be disrupted. Our ability to realize gross margin improvements and other efficiencies expected to result from these initiatives is subject to many risks, including delays in the anticipated timing of activities, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, unexpected costs associated with operating our business, our success in reinvesting any savings arising from these initiatives, time required to complete planned actions, absence of material issues associated with workforce reductions and avoidance of unexpected disruptions in service. A failure to implement these types of initiatives or realize expected benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition that could be material.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nAt September 30, 2020, the Company had $2,556 million of intangible assets and $1,478 million of goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The intangible assets are principally composed of technology and patents, customer relationships, and trademarks and trade names. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with determinable lives, which were $2,223 million at September 30, 2020, are tested for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment exists can be difficult and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $624 million and $657 million, respectively. The fiscal 2020 goodwill impairment charge resulted in the write-down of the full carrying value of the goodwill related to the Company's Products & Solutions segment primarily due to a reduction in the Company's long-term forecast to reflect increased risk from higher market uncertainty and the accelerated reduction of product sales related to the Company\u2019s historical on-premises perpetual licenses. The fiscal 2019 goodwill impairment charge also related to the Company\u2019s Products & Solutions segment and was primarily due to a sustained\ndecrease in the Company\u2019s stock price and a reduction in the Company\u2019s long-term forecast. To the extent that business conditions deteriorate further, or if changes in key assumptions and estimates differ significantly from management's expectations, it may be necessary to record additional impairment charges in the future. See Note 7, \"Goodwill,\" and Note 8, \"Intangible Assets,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nLevels of returns on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and post-retirement benefit plan liabilities could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition in future periods.\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations. Pension and other post-retirement plan costs and required contributions are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, level of employer contributions, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of our pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets compared to obligations under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation.\nIn addition, our major defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. These assets are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A decline in the market value of the pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets below our projected return rates will increase the funding requirements under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. We are responsible for funding any shortfall of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans\u2019 assets compared to obligations under the pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and a significant increase in our pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in our defined benefit pension plans in Germany.\nWe operate several defined benefit plans in Germany (collectively, the \"German Plans\") and as of September 30, 2020, the total projected benefit obligation for the German Plans of $527 million exceeded plan assets of $4 million, resulting in an aggregate pension liability for the German Plans of $523 million. Under the German Plans, which were closed to new members in 2006, retirees generally benefit from the receipt of a perpetual annuity at retirement, based on their years of service and ending salary. The total projected benefit obligation is based on actuarial valuations, which themselves are based on assumptions and estimates about the long-term operation of the plans, including mortality rates of members, the performance of financial markets and interest rates. Our funding requirements for future years may increase from current levels depending on the net liability position of these plans. In addition, if the actual experience of the plans differs from our assumptions, the net liability could increase and additional contributions may be required. Changes to pension legislation in Germany may also adversely affect our funding requirements. Increases in the net pension liability or increases in future cash contributions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur degree of leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding. As of September 30, 2020, we had $1,643 million of loans outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, $41 million issued and outstanding letters of credit and guarantees under the ABL Credit Agreement, $350 million of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 15, 2023 (the \"Convertible Notes\") and $1,000 million of 6.125% senior first lien notes due September 15, 2028 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) outstanding (all as defined in Part II, Item 8, Note 11, \"Financing Arrangements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, as of September 30, 2020 we could have borrowed an additional $153 million under our ABL Credit Agreement.\nOur degree of leverage could have consequences, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, research and development and future business opportunities;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates under Avaya Inc.\u2019s credit facilities to the extent such facilities\nhave variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to adjust quickly or at all to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nOur ability to continue to fund our obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund our debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our degree of leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Term Loan and ABL Credit Agreements and the indenture for our Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the indenture for the Convertible Notes does not restrict us from incurring additional debt. To the extent new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 currently anticipated debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify.\nOur financing agreements contain restrictions that limit, in certain respects, our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur financing agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specific types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt and issue or sell certain preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022incur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022sell assets to, or merge or consolidate with, another company.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt instruments.\nThere is no assurance we will be able to repay or refinance all or any portion of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt in the future. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due, the applicable secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and our other ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In particular, we intend to increase our recurring revenue by shifting more of our business to a subscription-based model. If we successfully increase our subscription revenues, we expect this will result in more of our cash receipts being deferred relative to our historical perpetual license model as payments are spread over a pre-determined time period (e.g., annually) rather than being received upfront, which may defer cash flows needed to service our debt. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our credit facilities and the indenture for our Senior Notes restrict the ability of Avaya Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. Accordingly, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain any proceeds on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nA ratings downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization could adversely affect our cost of capital.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have been, and will continue to be, subject to fluctuation. In addition, any adverse developments in our business and operations could lead to a ratings downgrade for Avaya Holdings Corp., Avaya Inc. or any of our rated debt securities. Any such fluctuation in our credit rating may impact our ability to access debt markets in the future or increase our cost of future debt which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, which in return may adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes\nThe price of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the price for our common stock has historically been volatile. The market price of our common stock, as well as our Convertible Notes (as they are convertible into our common stock), may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section):\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022political dynamics in the countries we operate in;\n\u2022fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022variances in our financial performance from the expectations of equity and/or debt research analysts;\n\u2022conditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u2022announcements of significant new services or products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022additions of or changes to key employees;\n\u2022changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022trading volumes of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes;\n\u2022future sales of our equity securities and/or future issuances of indebtedness;\n\u2022changes in the estimation of the future sizes and growth rates of our markets;\n\u2022legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;\n\u2022hedging or arbitrage trading activity by third parties, including by the counterparties to the note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes; and\n\u2022dilution that may occur upon any conversion of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock or the Convertible Notes or the exercise of the warrants we issued in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. These market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes irrespective of our operating performance.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on operating results, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock dilutes the relative voting power and ownership of holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to an Investment Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2019, by and between us and RingCentral, we sold 125,000 shares of our newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) to RingCentral on October 31, 2019 (the \u201cClosing\u201d).\nThe shares sold to RingCentral at the Closing represent approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis as of September 30, 2020. The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $16.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Certificate of Designations which details the terms and conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock. In any such vote, RingCentral's aggregate voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock and other shares of our common stock which may be issued to them under that certain\nFramework Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2019, by and between Avaya Inc. and RingCentral (the \"Framework Agreement\"), will be limited, prior to our receipt of an approval by our stockholders as required under New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual Rule 312.03 (\u201cStockholder Approval\u201d), to the voting power equivalent to no more than 19.9% of our outstanding common stock. If Stockholder Approval is obtained, this limitation will no longer apply. Notwithstanding that limit, the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock to RingCentral effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock. The conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock.\nFor a period of eighteen months following issuance of Series A Preferred Stock, the sale or transfer of the Series A Preferred Stock and the common stock issuable upon conversion thereof is subject to certain lock-up provisions that, subject to exceptions, prohibit sale or transfer. Following expiration of RingCentral\u2019s eighteen-month lock-up period, any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We granted RingCentral customary registration rights in respect of any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and have filed a registration statement permitting the resale by RingCentral of the common stock underlying the Series A Preferred Stock in compliance with this obligation. As a result, subject to certain exceptions, RingCentral will be able to freely sell common stock upon expiration of the lock-up. Sales by RingCentral of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and result in the interests of RingCentral differing from those of our common stockholders.\nAs a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, RingCentral is entitled to:\n\u2022receive dividends, in preference and priority to holders of our common stock or other series of Company stock, which will accrue on a daily basis at the rate of 3% per annum of the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock. The stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock is initially $1,000 per share and it will be increased by the sum of any dividends on such shares not paid in cash. These dividends are cumulative, compound quarterly and are paid quarterly in arrears.\n\u2022participate in any dividends we pay on our common stock, equal to the dividend which holders would have received if their Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock on the date such common stock dividend was determined.\n\u2022receive, in the event our Company is liquidated or dissolved, before any distribution is made to holders of our common stock, an amount equal to the liquidation preference (which equals the stated value referenced above plus any accrued and unpaid dividends) for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held.\nRingCentral also has certain redemption rights or put rights to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock after the termination of the Framework Agreement or upon the occurrence of certain events.\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAs a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, RingCentral has certain consent rights over charter amendments and issuances of senior equity and the ability to designate a member of our Board of Directors.\nThe transaction documents entered into in connection with the sale of the Series A Preferred Stock to RingCentral grant to RingCentral customary consent rights with respect to certain actions by us, including:\n\u2022amending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the Series A Preferred Stock; and\n\u2022issuing securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, pursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement, until such time when RingCentral and its affiliates hold or beneficially own less than 4,759,339 shares of our common stock (on an as-converted basis), RingCentral has the right to nominate one person for election to our Board of Directors and our Board of Directors will recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of such nominee.\nThe director designated by RingCentral is entitled to attend meetings of our Board\u2019s Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Governance Committees as a non-voting observer, or such director may choose to serve on the Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. Such director is also entitled to be an observer to the Compensation Committee of our Board.\nTo the extent that we seek to raise capital in the form of senior preferred stock, for instance because it is the most efficient or only form of capital available to us, or we need to amend our organizational documents for whatever reason and RingCentral does not provide its consent to any such issuance or amendment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or liquidity.\nRingCentral has certain redemption or put rights to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock for cash. We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance such a required repurchase.\nRingCentral has certain redemption or put rights to require us, to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock for cash. RingCentral can exercise such redemption rights, upon at least 21 days\u2019 notice, after the termination of the Framework Agreement or upon the occurrence of certain events. If and to the extent this redemption right is exercised, we would have to purchase each share of Series A Preferred Stock at the per share price equal to the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock, which is initially $1,000 per share and which will be increased by the sum of any dividends on such shares, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.\nIt is possible that we would not have sufficient funds to make any required repurchase of Series A Preferred Stock. Moreover, we may not be able to arrange financing, to pay the repurchase price.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and/or the market for our common stock.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. If we elect to satisfy this obligation by delivering common stock it would have a dilutive effect on our other stockholders. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge (\"Bond Hedge\") transaction with each of Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Capital LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the \"Call Spread Counterparties\"). The Bond Hedge transactions reduced the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We also entered into a warrant (\"Call Spread Warrant\") transaction with each of the Call Spread Counterparties. The Call Spread Warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the Call Spread Warrants.\nEach of the Call Spread Counterparties (or an affiliate) may modify its initial hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and is likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect the ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that holders of the Convertible Notes will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\nSignificant exercises of equity awards or warrants or conversion of preferred stock or convertible debt could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had 83,278,383 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include 5,078,773 shares and 5,645,200 shares that may be issued upon the exercise or vesting of equity awards and warrants issued upon emergence from bankruptcy, respectively. In addition, we have the ability to issue an additional 14,407,473 equity awards tied to our common stock under our currently authorized equity incentive plans. Furthermore, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Convertible Notes is 16,393,440 and our Series A Preferred Stock issued to RingCentral is convertible into 8,029,990 shares of common stock as of September 30, 2020. The exercise of equity awards and warrants and the conversion of our convertible debt instruments and preferred stock could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, will reduce the percentage of common stock held by the Company\u2019s current stockholders and may cause its current stockholders to suffer significant dilution, which may adversely affect the market.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of the preferred stock and the Convertible Notes.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Our governing documents include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to create and issue, without stockholder approval, up to 55,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, which could be used to dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022grant the board of directors the exclusive right to fill a vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy is due to an increase in the number of directors or death, resignation or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill such vacancies on the board of directors; and\n\u2022require stockholders to follow certain advance notice procedures to bring a proposal before an annual meeting, including proposing nominees for election as directors, which may discourage a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own director or slate of directors.\nThese provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of our preferred stock and Convertible Notes. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in the name of the Company, actions against our directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but will apply to other state and federal law claims including actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder). Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933 or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This forum selection provision in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our certificate of incorporation, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur ability to retain and attract key personnel is critical to the success of our business and execution of our growth strategy.\nThe success of our business depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employee base. If we are unable to retain and recruit sufficiently experienced and capable employees, including those who can help us increase revenues generated from our cloud-based solutions and services, our business and financial results may suffer. Experienced and capable employees in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity and/or errors due to insufficient staffing or managerial oversight. Moreover, turnover of senior management and other key personnel can adversely impact, among other things, our operating results, our customer relationships and lead us to incur significant expenses related to executive transition costs that may impact our operating results. In addition, our ability to adequately staff our R&D efforts in the U.S. may be inhibited by changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional and technical talent. While we strive to\nmaintain our competitiveness in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and attract the employees that we need to achieve our business objectives.\nBusiness interruptions, whether due to catastrophic disasters or other events, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations and those of our contract manufacturers and outsourced service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood or other natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, computer systems failure, telecommunications failure, quarantines, national catastrophe, terrorist activities, war and other events beyond our control. For instance, we have operations in the Silicon Valley area of California near known earthquake fault zones, which are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. Our disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to address these interruptions. If any disaster were to occur, our ability and the ability of our contract manufacturers and outsourced service providers to operate could be seriously impaired and we could experience material harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. Because our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our operations could harm our reputation as a reliable solutions provider. In addition, the coverage or limits of our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for any losses or damages that may occur.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU may adversely impact our operations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.\nIn June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". The political and economic instability created by the Brexit vote has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and the value of the Pound Sterling currency and other currencies, including the Euro. Depending on the terms reached regarding the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, it is possible that there may be adverse practical and/or operational implications on our business.\nCurrently, the most immediate impact may be to the relevant regulatory regimes under which our United Kingdom subsidiaries operate, including the offering of communications services, as well as data privacy. Since the vote to withdraw from the EU, negotiations and arrangements between the United Kingdom, the EU and other countries outside of the EU have been, and will continue to be, complex and time consuming. The potential withdrawal could adversely impact our United Kingdom subsidiaries and add operational complexities that did not previously exist.\nThe United Kingdom formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and immediately entered into an 11-month transition period during which all EU rules and trading agreements remain as they were. Discussions between the EU and the United Kingdom on securing a trade deal are ongoing with a December 2020 deadline. The impact on regulatory regimes remains uncertain if a trade deal is not reached. At this time, we cannot predict the impact of the EU and the United Kingdom failing to secure a trade deal may have on our business generally and our United Kingdom subsidiaries more specifically, and no assurance can be given that our operating results, financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted.\nA violation of the FCPA may adversely affect the Company's business and operations.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. We have adopted stringent procedures to enforce compliance with the FCPA. Nevertheless, we do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary and we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA. Our personnel and intermediaries, including our local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which we may be subject. Any allegation or determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our clients and customers, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nMost of our sales in the United States have standard payment terms of 30 days and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our solutions and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with installation and integration of our solutions and services.\nWe have a thorough credit process for extending credit limits to our customers, which considers the financial profile of our end user customers in addition to that of the direct customer, distributor or channel partner. We evaluate numerous factors in extending credit, which may include credit ratings, financial performance and discussions with customers. Notwithstanding\nthat, our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by periods of economic uncertainty or a global economic downturn. For instance, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain clients and customers have had and may continue to have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us, resulting in late or non-payment of amounts owed. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized or the Company's solutions and devices are sold. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions including the U.S. may be subject to change. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nU.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017 known colloquially as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" among other things, makes significant changes to the rules applicable to the taxation of corporations, such as changing the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, modifying the rules regarding limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation, introducing a capital investment deduction in certain circumstances, placing certain limitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain net operating losses, implementing a minimum tax on the \"global intangible low-taxed income\" of a \"United States shareholder\" of a \"controlled foreign corporation,\" modifying certain rules applicable to U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations, imposing a deemed repatriation tax on certain earnings and adding certain anti-base erosion rules. It is possible that any amendment to these new rules, or clarification as to the application thereof, may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nTax examinations and audits could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations.\nIf the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are a global company with significant international operations and we transact business in many currencies. As a result of our foreign operations, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary currency exposures relate to net operating expenses denominated in Euro, Indian Rupee and Mexican Peso. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and the geographic mix of our business changes. In addition, a portion of our borrowings bears interest at prevailing interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. Therefore, we are subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate. From time to time we use derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risks associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain intercompany obligations, as well as to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates. The measures we have taken to help mitigate these risks are discussed in Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, any attempts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate and/or interest rate fluctuation risk may be unsuccessful and result in an adverse impact to our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and we are also required to establish disclosure controls and procedures under applicable SEC rules. An effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud. Management is required to provide an annual assessment on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is also\nrequired to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our and our auditor\u2019s testing may reveal significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. In the past, these assessments and similar reviews have led to the discovery of material weaknesses, all of which have been remediated. However, no assurance can be given that we will not discover material weaknesses in the future. We have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404.\nWhile an effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting are generally not capable of preventing or detecting all financial reporting errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, is designed to reduce rather than eliminate the risk of material misstatements in our financial statements. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override and failure in human judgment. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses:\n\u2022we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations;\n\u2022our reputation may be adversely affected and our business and operating results could be harmed;\n\u2022the market price of our stock could decline; and\n\u2022we could be subject to litigation and/or investigations or sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), the New York Stock Exchange or other regulatory authorities.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. If the market is not sustained, it may be difficult for shareholders to sell shares of our common stock at a price that is attractive or at all. In addition, an inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies by using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 17234, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "AVYA"}
