RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this Annual Report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or occurrences, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nOur failure to successfully execute our cloud-first strategy and achieve the anticipated benefits of our business transformation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe successful implementation of our cloud-first strategy and completion of our business transformation presents organizational and infrastructure challenges. We may not be able to implement and realize some or all of the\nanticipated benefits from our strategy or our business transformation plan on a timely basis, or at all. Events and circumstances, such as financial or unforeseen difficulties, delays and unexpected costs, may occur that could result in our not realizing desired outcomes. Any failure to substantially implement the transformation of the Company in accordance with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized, there may be unforeseen consequences, internal control issues, or business impacts. Additionally, because of our restructuring efforts in connection with our business transformation, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring may require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business. Failure to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA core component of our strategy is to expand and enhance our offerings for cloud environments. It is uncertain whether these new offerings and deployment models will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary business models, infrastructure and systems to support the business. This includes acquiring, retaining and developing the right human capital to execute our business strategy in a competitive job market. In addition, market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to include functionality and usability that address customer requirements, and to optimally price our offerings and services to meet customer demand and cover our costs. Our go-to-market, cloud and multi-cloud cloud strategies also must adjust to customers' changing buying preferences, and there can be no assurance that our go-to-market approach will adequately and completely address such preferences. New product and services offerings may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs. If we are unable to correctly respond to these issues, our business could be harmed.\nAs part of our business strategy, we also continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development (\"R&D\") efforts in order to maintain and advance our competitive position, including our initiatives to provide and improve our offerings for cloud environments. However, we may not receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. R&D expenses represent a significant portion of our discretionary fixed costs. If we do not receive some or all of the expected benefits of our substantial investments in R&D, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our product innovation, particularly with respect to the advancement of our cloud-based technologies. If we are unable to successfully develop and launch cloud-based products and product enhancements and/or enable our data warehouse platform to operate effectively in cloud environments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nTo succeed in the intensely competitive IT industry, we must continually improve, refresh and expand our product and service offerings to include newer features, functionality, and deployment options and to keep pace with price-to-performance gains. This is particularly the case in the demand for analytic solutions in a cloud-based environment. The successful execution of our cloud-first strategy is dependent on the advancement of our cloud-based technologies. In furtherance of this strategy, we are focusing a significant amount of our R&D activities and resources to the development of cloud-based products and product enhancements and to enable our data warehouse platform to operate effectively in cloud environments. If we are unable to successfully develop and launch cloud-based products and product enhancements and/or enable our data warehouse platform to operate effectively in cloud environments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nShortened product life cycles due to customer demands and competitive pressures impact the pace at which we must introduce and implement new technology. This requires a high level of innovation by both our software developers and the suppliers of the third-party software components included in our solutions. In addition, bringing new offerings to the market entails a costly and lengthy process, and requires us to accurately anticipate customer needs and technology trends. If we are unable to respond to market demands, develop leading technologies, timely deliver offerings to the market, and maintain leadership in analytic data solutions performance and scalability, our business operations may be adversely affected.\nBecause of these and other factors, our ability to introduce new or improved solutions could be adversely impacted. There can be no assurance that our innovations will be profitable, and if we cannot successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions, our business and operating results could be impacted.\nAs we develop new offerings with greater capacity, delivery and performance capabilities, the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these offerings may increase the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability issues.\nOur offerings may contain undetected errors or security flaws, which may be found after the offerings are introduced and delivered. This risk is enhanced when offerings are first introduced or when new versions are released, as well as when we develop offerings with more advanced technology, since the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these offerings may increase the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability issues. Due to such complexities, our products may also fail to perform to the full specifications and expectations of our customers. Additionally, third-party components that we integrate in our solutions may have undetected quality issues that may impact the performance of our offerings. The correction and detection of errors may cause delays, lost revenues, and incremental costs. Errors in our software offerings could also affect their ability to work with other components of our offerings, could delay the development or release of new offerings, and could adversely affect their market acceptance. We may not be able to detect or remedy all errors, including those that may be deemed critical by our customers, prior to release or deployment. Such reliability, quality and operability issues may negatively impact our ability to retain current customers, including due to customer cancellations or non-renewals, as well as our ability to obtain new customers.\nOur customers who rely on our solutions for business-critical uses are more sensitive to errors, which could expose us to liability, performance and warranty claims, as well as harm our reputation. These and other risks associated with new offerings may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and future performance.\nIf our existing customers fail to renew, or cancel, their subscription license arrangements or support agreements, or if customers do not renew on terms favorable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nTeradata\u2019s platform offerings have been expanded to include a variety of subscription options, which impact the timing of when revenues are recognized and related cash flows are collected. In addition, due to the recent transition to subscription revenues, we currently derive a significant portion of our overall revenues from subscription services in which we have limited renewal experience, which carries additional risk. The IT industry generally has been experiencing increasing pricing pressure from customers when purchasing or renewing support agreements. Mergers and acquisitions in certain industries that we serve could result in a reduction of the software and hardware being supported and put pressure on our subscription and support terms with customers who have merged. Given these factors, there can be no assurance that our current customers will renew their subscription and/or support agreements or agree to the same terms when they renew, which could result in our reducing or losing subscription and/or support fees which could adversely impact operating results.\nUnanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles makes accurate estimation of our revenues difficult and could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nThe length of our sales cycle varies depending on several factors over which we may have little or no control, including the size and complexity of a potential transaction, the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities and our current and potential customers\u2019 internal budgeting and approval process, as well as overall macro-economic conditions. Because of a generally long sales cycle, we may expend significant effort over a long period of time in an attempt to obtain an order, but ultimately not complete the sale, or the order ultimately received may be smaller than anticipated. The long sales cycle for our products also makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could cause significant variability in our results for any particular period.\nWe may experience variability in our operating results based on the purchasing behavior of our customers.\nAs part of our strategy, our business has substantially shifted from traditional, perpetual pricing and revenue model to a subscription-based model in which less revenue is recognized upfront at the time the customer enters into a transaction. The pace and extent to which customers will continue to purchase and renew our offerings on a subscription basis is variable and therefore has impacts on our results and operations. In addition, we have recently\nintroduced flexible pricing options for our cloud customers, including consumption-based, \"pay as you go\" pricing. Under such a pricing model, we generally recognize revenue based on consumption. To the extent that customers opt for such a flexible pricing model, we may not be able to accurately forecast the timing of customer consumption of our offerings. As a result, our actual results may differ from our projections. Furthermore, our on-premises subscription arrangements may provide the customers with the right to cancel our agreement upon certain notice periods, which we may change in the future. Such arrangements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for these customers and result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nDemand for the offerings and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.\nWe operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success, including our ability to retain our existing customers and attract new customers. Operational factors such as failure to deliver high quality offerings or services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery or performance promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation.\nExternal factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in customer loyalty, customer cancellations or non-renewals, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability.In addition, given our history as an on-premises platform provider, one of our strategic objectives is to reset market perceptions to establish our position in the cloud market. A misperception in the market regarding our cloud capabilities could negatively impact our ability to migrate existing on-premises customers to our cloud-based solutions and/or acquire new customers for our cloud business.\nOur future results depend in part on our relationships with key suppliers, strategic partners and other third parties.\nOur development, marketing and distribution plans depend in part on our ability to form strategic alliances with third parties that have complementary offerings, software, services and skills. Our strategic partners include consultants and system integrators, software and technology providers, hardware support service providers, and indirect channel distributors in certain countries. These relationships involve risks, including our partners changing their business focus, entering strategic alliances with other companies, being acquired by our competitors, failing to meet performance criteria or improperly using our confidential information. If we fail to maintain or expand our relationships with strategic partners, or if we are forced to seek alternative technology, or technology for new solutions, that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, our business may be adversely affected.\nThird-party vendors provide important elements to our solutions; if we do not maintain our relationships with these vendors or if these vendors cease to be going concerns, interruptions in the supply of our offerings may result. There are some components of our solutions that we purchase from single sources due to price, quality, technology or other reasons. For example, we rely on Flex as a key single source contract manufacturer for our on-premises hardware systems. In addition, we buy servers from Dell Technologies Inc. and storage disk systems from NetApp, Inc. Some components supplied by third parties may be critical to our solutions, and several of our suppliers may terminate their agreements with us without cause with 180-days notice. In addition, we rely on certain vendors for hardware support services and parts supply. If we were unable to purchase necessary services, parts, components or offerings from a particular vendor and had to find an alternative supplier, our shipments and deliveries could be delayed. Also, quality issues, a disruption in our supply chain or the need to find alternative suppliers could impact the costs and/or timing associated with procuring necessary offerings, components and services. In any case, our operations could be adversely impacted. Similarly, our suppliers\u2019 offerings and services have certain dependencies with respect to their own supply chain networks, and supply issues among our suppliers\u2019 suppliers may also adversely impact our business.\nAs part of our cloud-first strategy, the growth of our business is dependent on our relationships with public cloud service providers, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Our strategic partnerships with Amazon, Google and Microsoft for our cloud offerings on AWS, Google and Azure, respectively, require significant investments to ensure that our solutions are optimized in these cloud environments. In addition, these cloud service providers maintain\nrelationships with certain of our competitors, and may in the future establish relationships with additional competing cloud data warehouse platform providers. Any of these cloud service providers may decide to modify or terminate our business relationship, or may otherwise enter into preferred relationships with one or more competing cloud data warehouse platform providers. If we are unsuccessful in meeting performance requirements or obtaining future returns on these investments, or if we are otherwise unable to maintain adequate relationships with any of these cloud service providers, our financial results may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition have been adversely affected, and could in the future be materially adversely affected, by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs more fully described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic in the future affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the unprecedented pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or respond to its impact, the successful distribution of vaccines and their effectiveness, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The COVID-19 pandemic or any other adverse public health development could also inhibit our ability to execute our strategic initiatives including, without limitation, improving the experience of our customers, investing identified strategic growth platforms and shifting the mix of revenue in our business to cloud as well as subscription revenue.\nFurthermore, negative economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted, and may in the future impact, our ability to close transactions and/or collect receivables from customers on a timely basis, or at all, and may also impact our customers' willingness to maintain or increase spending on data analytics, their ability to obtain adequate financing for the purchase of our products and services, or the amount of disposable income available to consumers, which may adversely impact the businesses of our customers in consumer-facing industries.\nAdditionally, governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and may continue to cause, consumers to avoid or limit gatherings in public places or social interactions, which could adversely affect the businesses of our customers in certain industries, such as transportation, entertainment and hospitality. Such customers have experienced, and may continue to experience,\nsignificant near-term working capital and cash flow adverse impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in turn, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase revenue from such customers. In addition, the global supply chain risks present a level of uncertainty due to the international and domestic pandemic recovery efforts. The uncertainty of an increase in the number of COVID-19 infections in areas where our suppliers source their parts could present sourcing challenges to our suppliers. Further, if countries in which we do business close their borders, it may impact the timing of closing sales transactions or the ability to service our customers in select geographies.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or directives, we have required most employees to work remotely. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines while our remote work policy remains in place.\nGovernmental authorities in the United States and throughout the world may increase or impose new income taxes or indirect taxes, or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations, as a means of financing the costs of stimulus and other measures enacted or taken, or that may be enacted or taken in the future, to protect populations and economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we have implemented programs to mitigate the impact of these risks on our results of operations, there can be no assurance that these programs will be successful and there are many aspects of this pandemic, particularly its impact on our customers, that are beyond our control. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, such as employee work locations, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine is in the best interests of our employees, customers, distributors, suppliers and contractors. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. Moreover, these measures, and similar\nmeasures at our customers, have resulted in, and in the future may result in, installation and payment delays. In addition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, delays and cancellations of consulting projects due to work from home and shelter-in-place orders and also because of the discretionary nature of consulting projects which may be delayed or suspended as a result of more conservative spending patterns by our customers in light of the economic impacts of the pandemic.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the economic recession that has occurred and any economic recession that may occur in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic could also exacerbate or trigger other risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA breach of security, disruption, or failure of our information systems or those of our third-party providers could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases (and the computer equipment and database information of certain suppliers and other third parties) from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, cyber-attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusions, malicious or unintended insider actions that cause loss of data or loss of systems, including phishing schemes, and other events. The occurrence of one or more of these events could result in system failures and other interruptions in our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or directives, we have required most employees to work remotely. This increases vulnerability to our systems as additional endpoints need to be managed.\nPrior to our transition to a subscription-based business, our customers generally purchased or leased on-premises hardware systems used in connection with our software solutions, which our customers deployed and operated. With respect to these types of customer on-premises solutions, the customer, directly or through its selected services providers, manages all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential, private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions, including any personally identifiable data or information, such as non-public data regarding our customers\u2019 employees, customers' customers, consumers, data subjects, individuals\u2019 identities, individual financial accounts and health information. By contrast, our software-as-a-service or cloud offerings generally require us to deploy or operate solutions for our customers, directly or through the use of third-party services providers, either on-premises at customer-selected data center facilities, or at third-party-hosted data center facilities. With respect to these cloud and software-as-a-service offerings, we and such service providers have increased roles, responsibilities and risk exposures regarding some or all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential, private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions on our systems or those of selected third-party providers. If unauthorized access to or use of such information or systems occurs, despite data security measures and third-party commitments to protect them, our results of operation, reputation, and relationships with our customers could be adversely impacted.\nExperienced computer programmers, Nation State Sponsored Advanced Persistent Code (\"NSSAPC\") attackers (from countries such as Iran, China, Russia and certain European Eastern Bloc countries) and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or that of our third-party providers and misappropriate or compromise our intellectual property or other confidential information or that of our customers, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our offerings or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our offerings. In addition, phishing-scheme-perpetrators may be able to lure employees or contractors into providing such perpetrators with information that may enable them to avoid some of our network security controls or those of third-party providers which could result in system disruptions or a loss of confidential and proprietary information.\nWe have been subject to actual and potential cyber-attacks, and there can be no assurance that our defensive measures will be adequate to prevent them in the future. There is risk that these types of activities will recur and persist, that one or more of them may be successful in the future, that one or more of them may have been or will be successful but not detected, prevented, remediated or mitigated by us, and the costs to us to eliminate, detect, prevent, remediate, mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, viruses, worms, malicious software\nprograms, phishing schemes and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could adversely impact our future results of operations.\nInadequate internal control over financial reporting and accounting practices could lead to errors, which could adversely impact our ability to assure timely and accurate financial reporting.\nInternal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives will be met. These inherent limitations include system errors, the potential for human error and unauthorized actions of employees or contractors, inadequacy of controls, temporary lapses in controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight or resources, and other factors. Consequently, such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial results as required under SEC and NYSE rules, which could increase our operating costs or impair our ability to operate our business. Controls may also become inadequate due to changes in circumstances, and it is necessary to replace, upgrade or modify our internal information systems from time to time. In addition, unforeseen risks may arise in connection with financial reporting systems due to inefficient business processes, business process reengineering projects, or changes in accounting standards.\nIf management is not successful in maintaining a strong internal control environment, material weaknesses could occur, causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could lead to a decline in our stock price, limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future, and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.\nOur business is affected by the global economies in which we operate and the economic climate of the industries we serve.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. In particular, the IT industry in which we operate is susceptible to significant changes in the strength of the economy and the financial health of companies and governmental entities that make spending commitments for new technologies. Accordingly, adverse global economic and market conditions, including in certain economic sectors in which many of our customers operate (such as retail, manufacturing, financial services or government), may adversely impact our business. For example, adverse changes to the economy could impact the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, decreased or more closely scrutinized spending in our customers\u2019 businesses and in the industries we serve, may adversely impact our business. Uncertainty about future economic conditions may make it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. The Company\u2019s success in periods of economic uncertainty may also be dependent, in part, on our ability to reduce costs in response to changes in demand and other activity.\nGenerating substantial revenues from our international operations poses several risks.\nIn 2020, the percentage of our total revenues from outside of the United States was 50%. We have exposure to more than 30 functional currencies. The risks associated with the geographic scope of our business operations include, among other things the following:\n\u2022Cultural and management challenges associated with operating in developing countries;\n\u2022Longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022Fluctuations in the value of local currencies;\n\u2022Tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment;\n\u2022US-China trade disputes or other international trade disputes may adversely affect sales of our solutions and services and may result in longer sales cycles;\n\u2022The continued economic and legal uncertainty around how the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (known as Brexit) will impact the United Kingdom\u2019s access to the EU Single Market, the related regulatory environment, the global economy and the resulting impact on our business; and\n\u2022The impact of catastrophic weather or other negative effects of climate change and public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), on our facilities, operations and/or workforce, as well as those of our customers, supply chains and distribution channels, throughout the world, particularly those in coastal areas.\nAny of these events, among others, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur offerings are subject to United States export controls and, when exported from the United States, or re-exported to another country, must be authorized under applicable United States export regulations. Changes in our offerings or changes in export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our offerings in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our offerings throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our offerings to certain countries or customers altogether. Any change in export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our offerings by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our offerings to, existing or potential customers with international operations.\nThere is active enforcement and ongoing focus by the SEC and other governmental authorities on the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws in other countries. Given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees, despite our high ethics, governance and compliance standards, which could put the Company at risk regarding possible violations of such laws and could result in various civil or criminal fines, penalties or administrative sanctions, and related costs, which could negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nThe IT industry is intensely competitive and evolving, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our pricing practices or demand for our offerings and services.\nWe operate in the intensely competitive IT industry, which is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and models for consuming and delivering business and IT services, frequent new product introductions, and frequent price and cost reductions. In general, as a participant in the data analytic solutions market, we face:\n\u2022Changes in customer IT spending preferences and other shifts in market demands, which drive changes in the Company's competition;\n\u2022Changes in pricing, marketing and product strategies, such as potential aggressive price discounting and the use of different pricing models by our competitors;\n\u2022Rapid changes in product delivery models, such as on-premises solutions versus cloud solutions;\n\u2022Rapid changes in computing technology and capabilities that challenge our ability to maintain differentiation at the lower range of business intelligence analytic functions;\n\u2022New and emerging analytic technologies, competitors, and business models;\n\u2022Continued emergence of open source software that often rivals current technology offerings at a much lower cost despite its limited functionality;\n\u2022Changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets; and\n\u2022Continuing trend toward consolidation of companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, including if our key partners merge or partner with our competitors.\nOur competitors include established companies within our industry, including Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, and SAP, which are well-capitalized companies with widespread distribution, brand recognition and penetration of platforms and service offerings. The significant purchasing and market power of these larger competitors, which have greater financial resources than we do, could allow them to surpass our market penetration and marketing efforts to promote and sell their offerings and services. In addition, many other companies participate in specific areas of our business, such as enterprise applications, analytic platforms and business intelligence software. In some cases, we may partner with a company in one area of our business and compete with them in another. In particular, in delivering our Vantage platform in a cloud environment to certain of our customers, we partner with each of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which are public cloud service providers. The status of our business relationships with these companies can influence our ability to compete for analytic data solutions opportunities in such areas. In addition, we see additional competition from both established and emerging companies such as Cloudera, MongoDB, Pivotal Software and Snowflake. Failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors in these and other areas could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate additional revenues or sustain existing revenue levels.\nPrivacy concerns and laws such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and services and adversely affect our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. In some cases, new data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation that took effect in May 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, and an amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information in Japan, expected to take effect in spring 2022, impose new obligations directly on the Company as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. These new laws may require us to make changes to our solutions and services to enable Teradata and/or our customers to comply with the new legal requirements and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. Further, laws such as the European Union\u2019s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals\u2019 online activities. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions and services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our solutions and services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. For example, legal challenges in Europe regarding how companies transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as renewing the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and services, reduce overall demand for our solutions and services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our solutions and services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as related International Organization for Standardization (\"ISO\") standards. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business\nFurthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers\u2019 customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our solutions and services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy\nof personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our offerings or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\nRISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL\nWe depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nOur employees and access to talent are critical to our success. Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain the services of senior management and key personnel in all functional areas of our Company, including engineering and development, marketing and sales professionals, and consultants. Competition for highly skilled personnel and acquired talent in the IT industry is intense. Furthermore, to advance our cloud-first strategy, we are required to attract and retain talent with expertise in cloud-based technologies, particularly with respect to our engineering and development teams. No assurance can be made that key personnel will remain with us, and it may be difficult and costly to replace such employees and/or obtain qualified talent who are not employees. Our failure to hire, retain and replace our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nWe face uncertainties regarding legal proceedings, complex and changing laws and regulations, and other related matters.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, claims and other matters, including those that relate to the environment, health and safety, employee benefits, export compliance, intellectual property, a variety of local laws and regulations, and other regulatory compliance and general matters. See \"Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties, their outcomes are not predictable. There can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations, including those relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and reporting, which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future. From time to time, we may conduct internal investigations in connection with our efforts to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations, the costs or results of which could impact our financial results. In addition, we may be subject to unexpected costs in connection with new public disclosure or other regulatory requirements that are issued from time to time. Laws and regulations impacting our customers, such as those relating to privacy, data protection and digital marketing, could also impact our future business. Because we do business in the government sector, we are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil or criminal fines, penalties or administrative sanctions, including debarment from future government business, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, our facilities and operations, including former facilities and former operations for which we may have liabilities, are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws. There can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not adversely impact future operating results.\nManagement time and resources are spent to understand and comply with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to such matters as corporate governance, accounting principles, public disclosure, SEC regulations, Basel III and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") where our shares are listed. Rapid changes in accounting standards, and federal securities laws and regulations, among others, may substantially increase costs to our organization, challenge our ability to timely comply with all of them and could have an impact on our future operating results.\nInadequate protection of Teradata\u2019s intellectual property or infringement of intellectual property that is owned by others could impact our business and financial condition.\nAs a technology company, our intellectual property portfolio is crucial to our continuing ability to be a leading multi-cloud data warehouse platform provider. We strive to protect and enhance our proprietary intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as through technological\nsafeguards. These efforts include protection of the offerings and application, diagnostic and other software we develop.\nIf we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, our business could be materially adversely impacted. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization or independently developing technology that is similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States (such as Iran, China and certain European Eastern Bloc countries who may use NSSAPC to advance their own industries). With respect to our pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims, and our competitors may already have applied for patents that, once issued, will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our offerings.\nWhile we take steps to provide for confidentiality obligations of employees and third parties with whom we do business (including customers, suppliers and strategic partners), there is a risk that such parties will breach such obligations and jeopardize our intellectual property rights. Many customers have outsourced the administration and management of their data warehouses to third parties, including some of our competitors, who then have access to our confidential information. Although we have agreements in place to mitigate this risk, there can be no assurance that such protections will be sufficient. In addition, our ability to capture and re-use field-based developed intellectual property is important to future business opportunities and margins.\nWe have seen a trend towards aggressive enforcement of intellectual property rights as the functionality of offerings in our industry increasingly overlaps and the volume of issued software patents continues to grow. As a result, we have been, and in the future could be, subject to infringement claims which, regardless of their validity, could:\n\u2022Be expensive, time consuming and divert management attention away from normal business operations;\n\u2022Require us to pay monetary damages or enter into non-standard royalty and licensing agreements;\n\u2022Require us to modify our product sales and development plans; or\n\u2022Require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.\nRegardless of whether these claims have any merit, they can be burdensome to defend or settle and can harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nA change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as:\n\u2022The jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; and\n\u2022Changes in available tax credits, especially surrounding tax credits in the United States for our research and development activities.\nTax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\"). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing. Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and inter-company arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our inter-company transactions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, however, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our financial flexibility.\nThe Company's indebtedness could:\n\u2022Expose us to interest rate risk;\n\u2022Increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022Limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing at attractive rates;\n\u2022Require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; and\n\u2022Place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt.\nFurther, our outstanding indebtedness is subject to financial and other covenants, which may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control. If we fail to comply with the covenants under any of our indebtedness, we may be in default under the loan, which may entitle the lenders to accelerate the debt obligations. To avoid defaulting on our indebtedness, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing or eliminating stock repurchases, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital, any of which may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021 or, for certain tenors of United States Dollar LIBOR, by the end of 2023. We have certain financial contracts, including our revolving credit agreement, term loan agreement, and interest rate swaps, that are indexed to LIBOR. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92293, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TDC"}
