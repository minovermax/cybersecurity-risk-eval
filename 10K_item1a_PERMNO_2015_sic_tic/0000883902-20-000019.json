{"cik": "883902", "company": "Cornerstone Building Brands, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks related to our industry and economic and market conditions\nOur industry is cyclical and highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Negative economic events including, but not limited to, recessions, lower consumer confidence, high interest rates, inflation, and lower new construction home starts may materially and adversely affect the outlook for our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe construction industry is highly sensitive to national and regional macroeconomic conditions.\nCurrent market estimates continue to show uneven activity across the nonresidential construction markets. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, Inc. (\"Dodge\"), low-rise nonresidential construction starts, as measured in square feet and comprising buildings of up to five stories, were down as much as approximately 5% in our fiscal 2019 as compared to our fiscal 2018.\nIn addition to commercial and residential market indicators, we also depend to a significant extent upon the levels of home repair and remodeling and new construction spending for our residential businesses, which declined significantly beginning in 2008 and continued through 2013 with recovery commencing in 2014. Housing levels in 2019 remained slightly lower relative to historical averages, despite the recovery the last few years, and are affected by such factors as interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, unemployment and the availability of consumer credit.\nOur performance is also dependent upon consumers having the ability to finance home repair and remodeling projects and/or the purchase of new homes. The ability of consumers to finance these purchases is affected by such factors as new and existing home prices, homeowners\u2019 equity values, interest rates and home foreclosures, which in turn could result in a tightening of lending standards by financial institutions and reduce the ability of some consumers to finance home purchases or repair and remodeling expenditures. Trends such as declining home values, increased home foreclosures and tightening of credit standards by lending institutions, negatively impacted the home repair and remodeling and the new construction sectors during the recession which began in 2008. Despite the recent abatement of these negative market factors, any recurrence or worsening of these items may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nHistorically, any uncertainty about current economic conditions has had a negative effect on our business, and will continue to pose a risk to our business as our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products. Other factors that could influence demand include fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the nonresidential real estate markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. From time to time, our industry has also been adversely affected in various parts of the country by declines in nonresidential construction starts, including but not limited to, high vacancy rates, changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry, high interest rates and the unavailability of financing. Sales of our products may be adversely affected by continued weakness in demand for our products within particular customer groups, or a continued decline in the general construction industry or particular geographic regions. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe cannot predict the timing or severity of any future economic or industry downturns or adverse weather conditions. A prolonged economic downturn or negative weather patterns, particularly in states where many of our sales are made, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainty and volatility in the financial markets and worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe markets in which we compete are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide, including availability of credit, interest rates, fluctuations in capital, credit and mortgage markets and business and consumer confidence. Adverse developments in global financial markets and general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability and the ability of our customers and suppliers to access capital. There was a significant decline in economic growth, both in the United States and worldwide, that began in the second half of 2007 and continued through 2009. In addition, volatility and disruption in the capital markets during that period reached unprecedented levels, with stock markets falling dramatically and credit becoming very expensive or unavailable to many companies without regard to those companies\u2019 underlying financial strength. There can be no guarantee that any improvement in these areas will continue or be sustained.\nRisks related to our business\nAn inability to successfully develop new products or improve existing products could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and/or retain existing customers, including our significant customers.\nOur success depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in product development and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur Windows and Siding segments depend on a core group of significant customers for a substantial portion of net sales and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. The loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationships with our largest customers, or loss of market position of any major customer, whether because of an inability to successfully develop new products or improve existing products, or otherwise, could cause a material decrease in net sales. The loss of, or a reduction in orders from, any significant customers, losses arising from customers\u2019 disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or performance or related matters, or an inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could adversely impact our net income and cash flow. In addition, revenue from customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period.\nManufacturing or assembly realignments may result in a decrease in our short-term earnings, until the expected cost reductions are achieved, due to the costs of implementation.\nWe continually review our manufacturing and assembly operations and sourcing capabilities. Effects of periodic manufacturing realignment, cost savings programs, and labor ramp-up costs could result in a decrease in our short-term earnings until the expected cost reductions are achieved and/or production volumes stabilize. Such programs may include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures. Such actions may not be accomplished as quickly as anticipated and the expected cost reductions may not be achieved or sustained.\nOur business may be adversely affected by weather conditions and other external factors beyond our control.\nMarkets for our products are seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions. Historically, our business has experienced increased sales in the second and third quarters of the year due to increased construction during those periods. Because much of our overhead and operating expenses are spread ratably throughout the year, our operating profits tend to be lower in the first and fourth quarters. Inclement weather conditions can affect the timing of when our products are applied or installed, causing reduced profit margins when such conditions exist. For example, unseasonably cold weather or extraordinary amounts of rainfall may decrease construction activity.\nFurther, other external factors beyond our control could cause disruptions at any of our facilities, including maintenance outages; prolonged power failures or reductions; a breakdown, failure or substandard performance of any equipment or other operational problems; disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including railroad tracks, bridges, tunnels or roads; fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic disasters; pandemics, such as Coronavirus; or an act of terrorism. Any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause a significant loss in production. As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility, which could cause our customers to purchase from our competitors either temporarily or permanently. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations\nPrice volatility and supply constraints for raw materials could prevent us from meeting delivery schedules to our customers or reduce our profit margins.\nOur business is heavily dependent on the price and supply of raw materials including steel, PVC resin, aluminum and glass. Raw material prices have been volatile in recent years and may remain volatile in the future. Raw material prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions domestically and internationally, currency fluctuations, the availability of raw materials, competition, labor costs, freight and transportation costs, production costs, tariffs, import duties and other trade restrictions. For example, in 2018, the Trump administration implemented new tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum into the United States.\nA sudden increase in demand for steel, PVC resin, aluminum or glass could affect our ability to purchase such raw materials and result in rapidly increasing prices. We have historically been able to substantially pass on significant cost increases in raw materials through price increases to our customers, however we may not be able to do so in the future. Further, if the available supply of any of the raw materials we use declines, we could experience a deterioration of service from our suppliers or interruptions or delays that may cause us not to meet delivery schedules to our customers. Any of these problems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give you no assurance that steel, PVC resin, aluminum or glass will remain available, that prices will not continue to be volatile or that we will be able to purchase these raw materials on favorable or commercially reasonable terms.\nFurther, we use energy in the manufacturing and transportation of our products. In particular, our manufacturing plants use considerable amounts of electricity and natural gas. Consequently, our operating costs typically increase if energy costs rise. During periods of higher energy costs, we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products. To the extent we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases or otherwise, our profitability and cash flow will be adversely impacted. We partially hedge our exposure to higher prices through fixed forward positions.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for materials in addition to steel, PVC resin, aluminum and glass, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to steel, PVC resin, aluminum and glass, our operations require other raw materials from third-party suppliers. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials, however, in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments or other factors beyond our control. Short- and long-term disruptions in our supply chain would result in a need to maintain higher inventory levels as we replace similar product, a higher cost of product and ultimately a decrease in our revenues and profitability. To the extent our suppliers experience disruptions, there is a risk for delivery delays, production delays, production issues or delivery of non-conforming products by our suppliers. Even where these risks do not materialize, we may incur costs as we prepare contingency plans to address such risks. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our delivery times extended, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, some of our third-party suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility or changing volumes while still performing up to our specifications.\nFailure to retain or replace key personnel could hurt our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the efforts, contributions and abilities of our senior management, plant managers and other highly skilled personnel, including our sales executives. These executives and managers have many accumulated years of experience in our industry and have developed personal relationships with our customers that are important to our business. If we do not retain the services of our key personnel or if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of such individuals, our customer relationships, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, or if such intellectual property rights become obsolete, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nAs a company that manufactures and markets branded products, we rely heavily on trademark and service mark protection to protect our brands. We also have issued patents and rely on trade secret and copyright protection for certain of our technologies. These protections may not adequately safeguard our intellectual property and we may incur significant costs to defend our intellectual property rights, which may harm our operating results. There is a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will infringe on our intellectual property rights, in which case we would have to defend these rights. There is also a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These third parties may bring infringement claims against us or our customers, which may harm our operating results.\nWe also rely on third party license agreements for certain trademarks and technologies we employ. There is a risk that third parties may modify or terminate such licenses, which may harm our operating results. While these license agreements generally provide that the licensors will indemnify us, subject to certain limitations, for certain infringement liabilities, our ability to seek indemnification from the respective licensors is limited by various factors, including the financial condition of the licensor as well as by the terms and limits of such indemnities or obligations. As a result, there can be no assurance that we could receive any indemnification from licensors, and any related infringement liabilities, costs or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective, that any pending or future patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could incur significant costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental, health and safety laws.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our employees and the end-users of our products, regulate the materials used in our products and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and other damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws or of any conditions contained in environmental permits can result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, requirements to install pollution or other controls or equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. We could be held liable for the costs to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or other sites at which we or predecessors released hazardous materials. We also could incur fines, penalties or sanctions or be subject to third-party claims, including indemnification claims, for property damage, personal injury or otherwise as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials. In addition, changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, including additional investigation, remediation or other obligations with respect to our products or business activities or the imposition of new permit requirements, may lead to additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in building codes and standards could increase the cost of our products, lower the demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur products and markets are subject to extensive and complex local, state, federal, and foreign statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations. These mandates, including building design and safety and construction standards and zoning requirements, affect the cost, selection, and quality requirements of building components like windows and siding.\nThese statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities as to the types and quality specifications of products used in new residential and non-residential construction and home renovations and improvement projects, and governmental authorities can impose different standards. Compliance with these standards and changes in such statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations may increase the costs of manufacturing our products or may reduce the demand for certain of our products in the affected geographical areas or product markets. Conversely, a decrease in product safety standards could reduce demand for our more modern products if less expensive alternatives that did not meet higher standards became available for use in that market. All or any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive.\nWe compete with all other alternative methods of building construction, which may be viewed as more traditional, more aesthetically pleasing or having other advantages over our products. In addition, competition in the construction markets of the building industry is intense. It is based primarily on quality; service; on-time delivery and project completion; ability to provide added value in the design and engineering of buildings; price; and personal relationships with customers.\nIn our Commercial segment, we compete with a number of other manufacturers of metal components and engineered building systems and providers of coil coating services ranging from small local firms to large national firms. In addition, we and other manufacturers of metal components and engineered building systems compete with alternative methods of building construction. If these alternative building methods compete successfully against us, such competition could adversely affect us. In addition, several of our competitors have been acquired by steel producers. Competitors owned by steel producers may have a competitive advantage on raw materials that we do not enjoy. Steel producers may prioritize deliveries of raw materials to such competitors or provide them with more favorable pricing, both of which could enable them to offer products to customers at lower prices or accelerated delivery schedules.\nIn our Siding and Windows segments, we compete with other national and regional manufacturers of exterior building products. Some of these companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to withstand changes in conditions in the industries in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. Competitors could take a greater share of sales and cause us to lose business from our customers. Additionally, our products face competition from alternative materials, such as wood, metal, fiber cement, masonry and composites in siding, and wood, composites and fiberglass in windows. An increase in competition from other exterior building products manufacturers and alternative building materials could cause us to lose our customers and lead to net sales decreases.\nWe face risks related to past and future acquisitions that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have a history of expansion through acquisitions, and we believe that if our industry continues to consolidate, our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to successfully complete acquisitions. Pursuing and integrating acquisitions involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022the risk of incorrect assumptions or estimates regarding the future results of the acquired business or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring the business;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations;\n\u2022unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired business;\n\u2022integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of the acquired business with those of our existing operations;\n\u2022increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; and\n\u2022potential litigation or other claims arising from the acquisition.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions or that any businesses or assets that we are able to acquire will be successfully integrated into our existing business. The incurrence of additional debt, contingent liabilities and expenses in connection with any future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict the effect, if any, that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims arising from the operations of businesses from periods prior to the dates we acquired them. These claims or liabilities could be significant. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners for these claims or liabilities is limited by various factors, including the specific limitations contained in the respective acquisition agreements and the financial ability of the former owners to satisfy such claims or liabilities. If we are unable to enforce any indemnification rights we may have against the former owners or if the former owners are unable to satisfy their obligations for any reason, including because of their current financial position, or if we do not have any right to indemnification, we could be held liable for the costs or obligations associated with such claims or liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating performance\nRestructuring our operations may harm our profitability, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to fully achieve the estimated cost savings is uncertain.\nWe have developed plans to improve cost efficiency and optimize our combined manufacturing plant footprint considering our recent acquisitions and restructuring efforts. Future charges related to the plans may harm our profitability in the periods incurred. Additionally, if we were to incur unexpected charges related to the plans, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nImplementation of these plans carry significant risks, including:\n\u2022actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to our customers;\n\u2022failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022potential adverse effects on our internal control environment and an inability to preserve adequate internal controls;\n\u2022diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and other strategic objectives; and\n\u2022failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees.\nBecause of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will fully realize the cost savings from these plans. If we do not fully realize the expected cost savings from these plans, our business and results of operations may be negatively affected. Also, if we were to experience any adverse changes to our business, additional restructuring activities may be required in the future.\nWe may be significantly affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change.\nConcern over the effects of global climate change has led to federal, state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions. In the past, the United States Congress has considered various bills to regulate GHG emissions. Though the legislation did not become law, the U.S. Congress could pass climate change legislation in the future. In addition, in the past, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, took steps to regulate GHG emissions, though at this time the EPA is not actively regulating GHG emissions. More stringent federal, regional, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to global climate change and GHG emissions may be adopted in the future. These laws and regulations could impact our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our products, and our customers, and could reduce demand for our products or cause us to incur additional capital, operating or other costs. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future legislation or regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our business. In addition, global climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms, floods, heat waves, and other events that could affect our facilities and demand for our products. We are mindful of the harmful effects of global climate change and are taking steps to minimize our GHG emissions.\nBreaches of our information system security measures could disrupt our internal operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology for the distribution of information internally and also to our customers and suppliers. This information technology is subject to theft, damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to malicious computer viruses, security breaches and defects in design. Purchase of our products may involve the transmission and/or storage of data, including in certain instances customers\u2019 business and personally identifiable information. Thus, maintaining the security of computers, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers, as security breaches could result in vulnerabilities and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have in the past faced, and may in the future face attempts by hackers, cybercriminals or others with authorized access to our systems to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology, interrupt our business, and/or gain unauthorized access to confidential information. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software, and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in a loss or damage to our data, it could cause harm to our reputation or brand. This could lead some customers to stop purchasing our products and reduce or delay future purchases of our products or the use of competing products; lead to state or federal enforcement action, which could result in fines, penalties and/or other liabilities and which may cause us to incur legal fees and costs; and/or result in additional costs associated with responding to a cyberattack. Increased regulation regarding cyber security may increase our costs of compliance, including fines and penalties, as well as costs of cyber security audits. Any of these actions could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have invested in industry appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and continue to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to our third party providers\u2019 databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nDamage to our computer infrastructure and software systems could harm our business.\nThe unavailability of any of our primary information management systems for any significant period of time could have an adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to deliver products to our customers when needed, collect our receivables and manage inventory levels successfully largely depend on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. Through information management systems, we provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel, improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could lead to business interruptions that could harm our reputation, increase our operating costs and decrease our profitability. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from power loss, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses.\nWe have contracted with third-party service providers that provide us with redundant data center services in the event that our major information management systems are damaged. The backup data centers and other protective measures we take could prove to be inadequate. Our inability to restore data completely and accurately could lead to inaccurate and/or untimely filings of our periodic reports with the SEC, tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or other required filings, all of which could have a significant negative impact on our corporate reputation and could negatively impact our stock price or result in fines or penalties that could impact our financial results.\nOur enterprise resource planning technologies will require maintenance or replacement in order to allow us to continue to operate and manage critical aspects of our business.\nWe rely heavily on enterprise resource planning technologies (\u201cERP Systems\u201d) from third parties in order to operate and manage critical internal functions of our business, including accounting, order management, procurement, and transactional entry and approval. Certain of our ERP Systems are no longer supported by their vendor, are reaching the end of their useful life or are in need of significant updates to adequately perform the functions we require. We have limited access to support for older software versions and may be unable to repair the hardware required to run certain ERP Systems on a timely basis due to the unavailability of replacement parts. In addition, we face operational vulnerabilities due to limited access to software patches and software updates on any software that is no longer supported by their vendor. We are planning hardware and software upgrades to our ERP Systems and are in discussions with third-party vendors regarding system updates.\nIf our ERP Systems become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our operational efficiency could be harmed and we may face increased replacement costs. We may also face extended recovery time in the event of a system failure due to lack of resources to troubleshoot and resolve such issues. Our ability to manage our operations could be interrupted and our order management processes and customer support functions could be impaired until equivalent services are identified, obtained and implemented on commercially reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe risk liabilities and losses due to personal injury, property damage or product liability claims, which may not be covered by insurance.\nOur workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with work in manufacturing environments. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, as well as damage to or destruction of business personal property, and possible environmental impairment. We are subject to either deductible or self-insured retention (SIR) amounts, per claim or occurrence, under our Property/Casualty insurance programs, as well as an individual stop-loss limit per claim under our group medical insurance plan. We maintain insurance coverage to transfer risk, with aggregate and per-occurrence limits and deductible or retention levels that we believe are consistent with industry practice. The transfer of risk through insurance cannot guarantee that coverage will be available for every loss or liability that we may incur in our operations.\nExposures that could create insured (or uninsured) liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including but not limited to injury frequency and severity, natural disasters, terrorism threats, third-party liability, and claims that are incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d). Although we engage third-party actuarial professionals to assist us in determining our probable future loss exposure, it is possible that claims or costs could exceed our estimates or our insurance limits, or could be uninsurable. In such instances we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these losses rather than to maintain or expand our operations, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nFurther, we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims, including class action claims and warranties, in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event that any of our products are defective or prove to be defective, among other things, we may be responsible for damages related to any defective products and may be required to cease production, recall or redesign such products. Because of the long useful life of our products, it is possible that latent defects might not appear for several years. Any insurance we maintain may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Further, any claim or product discontinuance, recall or redesign could result in adverse publicity against us, which could cause sales to decline, or increase warranty costs.\nWe face risks related to our international operations.\nIn addition to the United States, we operate our business in Canada and Mexico and make sales in certain other jurisdictions. Our operations in Canada generated approximately 7.0% of our revenues in 2019. As such, our net sales, earnings and cash flow are exposed to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, which can be difficult to mitigate. Depending on the direction of changes relative to the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar values can increase or decrease the reported values of our net assets and results of operations. We hedge this foreign currency exposure by evaluating the usage of certain derivative instruments which hedge certain, but not all, underlying economic exposures\nOur international operations require us to comply with certain U.S. and international laws, such as import/export laws and regulations, anti-boycott laws, economic sanctions, laws and regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world, including Mexico, that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents, or that the operations of acquired businesses will have been conducted in accordance with our policies and applicable regulations. If we are found to be liable for violations of these laws (either due to our own acts, out of inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including limitations on our ability to conduct our business, which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreases in labor costs, potential labor disputes, union organizing activity and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers could delay or impede our production, reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.\nOur financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 12% of our employees were represented by labor unions. We are subject to the risk that strikes or other types of conflicts with personnel may arise or that we may become a subject of union organizing activity. Furthermore, some of our direct and indirect suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where components of our products are manufactured. Any interruption in the production or delivery of our products could reduce sales of our products and increase our costs. Our ability to attract and retain qualified manufacturing personnel to operate our manufacturing plants efficiently is critical to our financial performance. Any labor shortage will create operating inefficiencies that could adversely impact our financial performance.\nSignificant changes in factors and assumptions used to measure our defined benefit plan obligations, actual investment returns on pension assets and other factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nThe recognition of costs and liabilities associated with our pension plans for financial reporting purposes is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans. The inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management\u2019s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on reported results are the discount rate, the estimated long-term return on plan assets for the funded plans, retirement rates, and mortality rates. These assumptions are generally updated annually.\nIn recent years, the declining interest rates and changes to mortality assumptions have negatively impacted the funded status of our pension plans. In addition, volatile asset performance, most notably since 2008, has also negatively impacted the funded status of our pension plans. Funding requirements for our pension plans may become more significant. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our pension plan obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nRisks related to the Merger\nFully integrating Ply Gem\u2019s business following the Merger may be more difficult, costly and time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our Common Stock.\nWhile the Company\u2019s management has made progress in integrating Ply Gem\u2019s business with our pre-Merger business, integration efforts are still underway. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and the Company\u2019s management may face significant, ongoing challenges in implementing such integration, many of which may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation:\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating accounting, information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;\n\u2022difficulties in managing a larger surviving corporation, addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger.\nSome of these factors are outside the control of the Company, and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, as well as decreases in revenue, which could materially impact the business, financial conditions and results of operations of the Company. The integration process may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and others with whom the pre-Merger businesses had business or other dealings.\nRisks related to our Common Stock and significant stockholders\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance;\n\u2022variability in our revenues;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by analysts;\n\u2022our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;\n\u2022uncertainty about current global economic conditions;\n\u2022sales of our Common Stock by our significant stockholders;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and\n\u2022other general economic conditions.\nDuring 2019, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $9.30 per share to a low of $3.75 per share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our Common Stock in the future.\nThe CD&R Investors own a significant amount of our Common Stock and have substantial governance and other rights pursuant to the New Stockholders Agreement.\nThe CD&R Investor Group collectively owned approximately 49.1% of our outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 2019. As a significant stockholder, the CD&R Investors could significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of directors, the adoption of any amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. Their influence over Cornerstone may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other stockholders.\nFurther, the CD&R Investor Group has substantial governance and other rights pursuant to the New Stockholders Agreement, including the ability, for so long as it beneficially owns at least 7.5% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, to nominate for election, fill vacancies and appoint replacements for a number of Board members in proportion to the CD&R Investor Group\u2019s percentage beneficial ownership of our outstanding Common Stock, but never to exceed one less than the number of independent, non-CD&R-affiliated directors serving on the Board.\nTransactions engaged in by the CD&R Investors, the Golden Gate Investors or our directors or executives involving our Common Stock may have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nWe are party to the New Registration Rights Agreement, which grants the Investors customary demand and piggyback registration rights. We filed two shelf registration statements on Form S-3, declared effective by the SEC on April 8, 2016 and February 28, 2019, registering the resale of shares of our Common Stock held by the CD&R Fund VIII Investor Group and the Golden Gate Investors, respectively. At any time after May 16, 2020, CD&R Pisces may request in writing that the Company effect the registration of all or any part of the shares of Common Stock that CD&R Pisces beneficially owns.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the CD&R Fund VIII Investor Group, CD&R Pisces and the Golden Gate Investor Group owned approximately 18.1%, 31.0% and 13.3%, respectively, of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. Future sales of our shares by these stockholders could have the effect of lowering our stock price. The perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares by these stockholders could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock, thus causing the price of our stock to decline. In addition, actual or anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of stock by our directors or officers could cause other institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our Common Stock, which may further cause the price of our stock to decline.\nFrom time to time our directors, executive officers, or any of the Investors may sell shares of our Common Stock on the open market or otherwise, for a variety of reasons, which may be related or unrelated to the performance of our business. These sales will be publicly disclosed in filings made with the SEC. Our stockholders may perceive these sales as a reflection on management\u2019s view of the business which may result in a drop in the price of our stock or cause some stockholders to sell their shares of our Common Stock.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and make payments on our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of approximately $3.2 billion.\nThe amount of our debt or other similar obligations could have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and who, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations, growth strategy or efforts to improve operating margins of our business units.\nIf we cannot service our debt, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying acquisitions and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We can give you no assurance that we can do any of these things on satisfactory terms or at all.\nFurther, the terms of the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement, the Current ABL Credit Agreement and the Current Indenture provide us and our subsidiaries with the flexibility to incur a substantial amount of additional secured or unsecured indebtedness in the future if we or our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth therein. Any such incurrence of additional indebtedness may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we were able to borrow up to approximately $425.9 million under the Current ABL Facility. All of these borrowings under the Current ABL Facility would be secured.\nThe Current Indenture, the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement and the Current ABL Credit Agreement contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to engage in certain business and financial transactions.\nThe Current Indenture, the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement and the Current ABL Credit Agreement (each as defined in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\") contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions in respect of capital stock;\n\u2022repurchase, prepay or redeem the 8.00% Senior Notes (as defined in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\") and subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022incur additional liens;\n\u2022transfer or sell assets;\n\u2022create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022make negative pledges;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the Current Cash Flow Revolver (as defined in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\") requires us to maintain a maximum total secured leverage ratio under certain circumstances, and the Current ABL Facility (as defined in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\") requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances. The Current ABL Credit Agreement also contains other covenants customary for asset-based facilities of this nature. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the Current Cash Flow Revolver and the Current ABL Facility depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants.\nWe are required to make mandatory pre-payments under the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement and the Current ABL Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including the sale of assets and the issuance of debt, in each case subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement and the Current ABL Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances and subject to the limitations set forth in the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement, the Current Term Loan Facility (as defined in Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\") may require us to make prepayments of the term loans to the extent we generate excess positive cash flow each year, beginning with the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAny future financing arrangements entered into by us may also contain similar covenants and restrictions. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restricted in our activities. These covenants and restrictions could also adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nOur failure to comply with obligations under the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement, the Current ABL Credit Agreement or the Current Indenture, as well as others contained in any future debt instruments from time to time, may result in an event of default under the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement, the Current ABL Credit Agreement or the Current Indenture, as applicable. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nAlthough we believe that our current cash position and the additional committed funding available under the Current ABL Facility and the Current Cash Flow Revolver is sufficient for our current operations, any reductions in our available borrowing capacity, or our inability to renew or replace our debt facilities, when required or when business conditions warrant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to secure additional financing or financing on favorable terms and to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic and market conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution.\nOur credit ratings are important to our cost of capital. The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt based on a number of factors, which include financial strength and business risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. A downgrade in our debt rating could result in increased interest and other expenses on our existing variable interest rate debt, and could result in increased interest and other financing expenses on future borrowings. Downgrades in our debt rating could also restrict our access to capital markets and affect the value and marketability of our outstanding notes.\nOur ability to access future financing also may be dependent on regulatory restrictions applicable to banks and other institutions subject to U.S. federal banking regulations, even if the market would otherwise be willing to provide such financing.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability, decrease our liquidity and impact our solvency.\nTo the extent LIBOR exceeds 0.00%, our indebtedness under the Current Cash Flow Facilities (as defined in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\") and the Current ABL Facility will bear interest at variable rates, and our future indebtedness may bear interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could increase the cost of servicing such debt and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, assuming all Current ABL Facility revolving loans were fully drawn, each one percent change in interest rates would result in approximately a $31.7 million change in annual interest expense on the Current Term Loan Facility and the Current ABL Facility. The impact of such an increase would be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our substantial debt.", "PERMNO": 77501, "SIC": 3448, "TIC": "CNR"}
