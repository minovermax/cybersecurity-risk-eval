RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If any of these risks occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could be decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\nOutbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The international stock markets reflect the uncertainty associated with the slow-down in the global economy and the reduced levels of international travel experienced since the beginning of January 2020, large declines in oil prices and the significant decline in the Dow Industrial Average at the end of February and beginning of March 2020 was largely attributed to the effects of COVID-19.\nMore specifically our business was affected to a large extent by a shut-down of operations both for ourselves and our clients for much of the first half of 2020. Total revenue for fiscal year 2020 was $2,254,811 compared to $2,949,780 for fiscal year 2021. The increase year o ver year is largely attributable to the growth in the provision of business services, which mainly comprise business consulting and advisory services as well as company secretarial, accounting and financial analysis services. When nation-wide shutdowns were mandated the first half of 2020, there was a corresponding decline in demand for our business services. When business gradually resumed beginning the latter half 2020, we saw a corresponding increase in orders of our business services.\nThe full extent of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and the pandemic is still ongoing. The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and its variants and the actions taken globally to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, the efficacy of vaccines on COVID-19 and its variants, among others. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from all such possible events.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event and may hamper our efforts to contact our service providers and advisors and to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations with the SEC, especially in the event of office closures, stay-in-place orders and a ban on travel or quarantines. We are still assessing our business operations and the impact COVID-19 may have on our results and financial condition, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-019 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company.\nWe were incorporated in Nevada in July 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have generated $2,949,780 and $2,254,811, respectively, in revenues and incurred net losses of $14,363,232 and $3,752,953, respectively. The likelihood of our success must be considered in the light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we are operating. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:\n\u25cf our ability to market our product and services;\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues; and\n\u25cf our ability to raise the capital necessary to continue marketing and developing our product.\nWe are not currently profitable and may not become profitable.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $5,338,571 cash on hand and our common stockholders\u2019 equity was $18,811,934. We have generated $2,949,780 in revenue in 2021 and have incurred operating loss of $2,754,684 and net loss of $14,363,232. We expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability. We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future due to operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our business.\nWe may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $14,363,232 and used cash in operating activities of $2,023,150. In addition, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company\u2019s December 31, 2021 audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company\u2019s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing, if necessary, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.\nOur operating results may prove unpredictable which could negatively affect our profit.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which we have no control. Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly include: our inability to generate enough working capital from future equity sales; the level of commercial acceptance by clients of our services; fluctuations in the demand for our service the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure and general economic conditions. If realized, any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for our service or establish a significant market presence, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nOur growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully market our service to prospective clients. However, our planned services may not achieve significant acceptance. Such acceptance, if achieved, may not be sustained for any significant period of time. Failure of our services to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations.\nManagement\u2019s ability to implement the business strategy may be slower than expected and we may be unable to generate a profit.\nOur business plans, including offering a cloud accounting system and consulting services, may not occur. Our growth strategy is subject to significant risks which you should carefully consider before purchasing our shares.\nOur services may be slow to achieve profitability, or may not become profitable at all, which will result in losses. There can be no assurance that we will succeed.\nWe may be unable to enter into our intended markets successfully. The factors that could affect our growth strategy include our success in (a) developing our business plan, (b) obtaining our clients, (c) obtaining adequate financing on acceptable terms, and (d) adapting our internal controls and operating procedures to accommodate our future growth.\nOur systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the expansion of our business operations. Significant growth will place managerial demands on all aspects of our operations. Our future operating results will depend substantially upon our ability to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical, administrative and financial controls and reporting systems.\nCompetitors may enter this sector with superior service which would affect our business adversely.\nWe believe that barriers to entry are low to medium because of economies of scale, cost advantage and brand identity. Potential competitors may enter this sector with superior services. This would have an adverse effect upon our business and our results of operations. In addition, a high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and recurring sales of our services. Despite having accumulated customers from the past four years, we may still need to continue to improve our platform and software to assist potential customers in using our platform, and we also need to provide effective support to future clients. If we are unable to increase customer support and improve our platform in the face of increasing competition, with the increase in competition, our ability to sell our services to potential customers could adversely affect our brand, which would harm our reputation.\nOur use of open source and third-party software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our services.\nWe intend to incorporate open-source software into our platform. Although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts or jurisdictions elsewhere, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our services. We could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open-source software incorporated into our products. In either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue our services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also intend to incorporate certain third-party technologies, including software programs, into our website and may need to utilize additional third-party technologies in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in releases of our platform until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Any disruption in our access to software programs or third-party technologies could result in significant delays in releases of our platform and could require substantial effort to locate or develop a replacement program. If we decide in the future to incorporate into our products any other software program licensed from a third party, and the use of such software program is necessary for the proper operation of our appliances, then our loss of any such license would similarly adversely affect our ability to release our products in a timely fashion.\nThe security of our computer systems may be compromised and harm our business.\nA significant portion of our business operations is conducted through use of our computer network. Although we intend to implement security systems and procedures to protect the confidential information stored on these computer systems, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties. As well, they may be able to create system disruptions, shutdowns or effect denial of service attacks. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our networks or client computers, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, or that misappropriate and distribute confidential information stored on these computer systems. Any of the foregoing could result in damage to our reputation and customer confidence in the security of our products and services and could require us to incur significant costs to eliminate or alleviate the problem. Additionally, our ability to transact business may be affected. Such damage, expenditures and business interruption could seriously impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse developments in our existing areas of operation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur operations focus on utilizing the sales efforts which are principally located in South-East Asia and East Asia. As a result, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition depend upon the demand for our services in these regions. Lack of broad diversification in the industry type and geographic location, adverse developments in our current segment of the midstream industry, or in our existing areas of operation, could have a greater impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition than if our operations were more diversified.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in South-East Asia and East Asia\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nOur business operations are conducted in South-East Asia and East Asia. Accordingly, the results of our operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal conditions of the South-East Asia and East Asia countries where we intend to develop business. Following the closing of our initial public offering in 2017, we derive a significant portion of our revenues and earnings from Hong Kong, our principal business place, PRC, Malaysia and other South-East Asia countries, respectively. Operation in multiple foreign countries involves substantial risk. For example, our operations and business activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and security requirements, labor laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, and anti-competition regulations. As we expand into additional countries, the complexity inherent in complying with these laws and regulations increases, making compliance more difficult and costly and driving up the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, make it more difficult or impossible to do business in that country and harm our reputation.\nWe face the risk that changes in the world economy and political developments in Malaysia may adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, there have been political instabilities in the Malaysian government which may reduce investors\u2019 confidence, result in reduction in foreign direct investment and weigh on consumer and business sentiment, depressing growth. In addition, the Malaysian economy is reliant on external demand. Any possible worsening global demand is likely to hinder the export development and any economic weakness may possibly lead to market intervention and the government may impose capital controls. Under these circumstances, our business operation may be adversely affected.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nWe are a Nevada corporation but most of our assets are and will be located outside of the United States. Almost all our operations are conducted in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the PRC. In addition, most of our officers and directors are the nationals and residents of a country other than the United States. Most of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon them. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, since he or she is not a resident in the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Hong Kong or other Asian countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts.\nPayment of dividends is subject to restrictions under Nevada, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the PRC laws.\nUnder Nevada law, we may only pay dividends subject to our ability to service our debts as they become due and provided that our assets will exceed our liabilities after the payment of such dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will therefore depend on our ability to generate adequate profits. Under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, we are permitted to make payments of dividends from distributable profits (that is, accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses). Under the Laws of Malaysia, we may only make a distribution to the shareholders out of our profits available if we are solvent. The Company is regarded as solvent if the Company can pay its debts as and when the debts become due within twelve months immediately after the distribution is made. In addition, because of a variety of rules applicable to our operations in China and the regulations on foreign investments as well as the applicable tax law, we may be subject to further limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe can give no assurance that we will declare dividends of any amounts, at any rate or at all in the future. The declaration of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial conditions, legal and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in Hong Kong and China\nIntroduction of new laws or changes to existing laws by the PRC government may adversely affect our business.\nThe PRC legal system is a codified legal system made up of written laws, regulations, circulars, administrative directives and internal guidelines. Unlike common law jurisdictions like the U.S., decided cases (which may be taken as reference) do not form part of the legal structure of the PRC and thus have no binding effect on subsequent cases with similar issues and fact patterns. Furthermore, in line with its transformation from a centrally planned economy to a relatively free market economy, the PRC government is still in the process of developing a comprehensive set of laws and regulations. As the legal system in the PRC is still evolving, laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same may be subject to further changes. For example, the PRC government may impose restrictions on the amount of service fees that may be payable by municipal governments to wastewater and sludge treatment service providers. Also, the PRC central and municipal governments may impose more stringent environmental regulations which would affect our ability to comply with, or our costs to comply with, such regulations. Such changes, if implemented, may adversely affect our business operations and may reduce our profitability\nWe face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nThe PRC\u2019s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the central government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions of the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, we cannot assure you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social environment.\nThe recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in Hong Kong and China.\nRecently, the Chinese government announced that it would step up supervision of Chinese firms listed offshore. Under the new measures, China will improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security, crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading, China will also check sources of funding for securities investment and control leverage ratios. The Cyberspace Administration of China (\u201cCAC\u201d) has also opened a cybersecurity probe into several U.S.-listed tech giants focusing on anti-monopoly, financial technology regulation and more recently, with the passage of the Data Security Law, how companies collect, store, process and transfer data. If our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries are subject to such a probe or if they are required to comply with stepped-up supervisory requirements, valuable time from management and money may be expended in complying and/or responding to the probe and requirements, thus diverting valuable resources and attention away from our operations. This may, in turn, negatively impact their operations.\nThe Company is headquartered in Malaysia with operations in Hong Kong and China. The Company is NOT a Chinese operating company but a Malaysian holding company with operations conducted by its subsidiaries based in China and that this structure involves unique risks to investors. It does not use variable interest entities in its corporate structure. It provides cross-border business solutions such as tax planning, trust and wealth management, cross border listing advisory services, transaction services, record management services, and accounting outsourcing services. One of its venture capital business segments focuses on rental activities of commercial properties and the sale of investment properties. None of the aforesaid business activities appears to be within the current targeted areas of concern by the Chinese government. The Company plans to continue to explore future potential business opportunities in the Asia region, in particular South East Asia. Nonetheless, it intends to keep Hong Kong and China as part of its operating structure going forward and this would potentially subject it to political and economic influence from China to the extent of such operations.\nBecause of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries in Hong Kong and mainland China and its operations there and given the Chinese government\u2019s significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our Hong Kong and PRC subsdiaries\u2019 business operations there, there is always a risk that the Chinese government may, in the future, seek to affect operations of any company with any level of operations in China including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept foreign investment. In light of China\u2019s recent extension of authority not only in China but into Hong Kong, there are risks and uncertainties which it cannot foresee for the time being, and rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little or no advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence the Company\u2019s current and future operations in Hong Kong and China at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in issuers likes ourselves.\nIf any or all of the foregoing were to occur, this could lead to a material change in our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries\u2019 operations and/or the value of the Company common stock and/or significantly limit or completely hinder its ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nOur shares may be delisted under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (\u201cHFCCA\u201d) if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021. If the bill passed by the U.S. Senate on June 22, 2021 is passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, this would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two. The delisting of our shares, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states if the SEC determines that a company has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit such shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two.\nThe lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause existing and potential investors in our stock to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. A company will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a \u201cnon-inspection\u201d year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC began to assess how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including the listing and trading prohibition requirements described above.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that the Board is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The Board made these determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework for how the PCAOB fulfils its responsibilities under the HFCAA.\nThe rules apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate (\u201cCommission-Identified Issuers\u201d). The final amendments require Commission-Identified Issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that, if true, it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in the public accounting firm\u2019s foreign jurisdiction. The amendments also require that a Commission-Identified Issuer that is a \u201cforeign issuer,\u201d as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide certain additional disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of its consolidated foreign operating entities. Further, the release provides notice regarding the procedures the SEC has established to identify issuers and to impose trading prohibitions on the securities of certain Commission-Identified Issuers, as required by the HFCAA.\nThe SEC will identify Commission-Identified Issuers for fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2020. A Commission-Identified Issuer will be required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified. If a registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur current auditor, JP Centurion & Partners PLT (\u201cCenturion\u201d) is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Our previous auditors, JLKZ CPA LLP (\u201cJLKZ\u201d) and Weinberg & Company, P.A. (\u201cWeinberg\u201d) are both headquartered in the United States of America and are the independent registered public accounting firms that issued the audit reports included in this proxy statement, and as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and firms registered with the PCAOB, are subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess their compliance with the applicable professional standards. We are not aware of any reasons to believe or conclude that Centurion, JLKZ or Weinberg would not permit an inspection by PCAOB or that either one may not be subject to such inspection. Centurion, JLKZ and Weinberg are outside the jurisdiction of Hong Kong and China and have assured us that if requested, they shall cooperate and deliver work papers of our Chinese subsidiaries to the PCAOB for inspection. We cannot assure you that the jurisdiction in which our current auditor is located would not implement rules forbidding our auditor to be subject to PCAOB inspection. If such rules were to be implemented, we may have to incur substantial costs and time to appoint a new auditor to re-audit our financials. This could cause the market price of our shares to be materially and adversely affected, and our securities could be delisted or prohibited from being traded on the national securities exchange if we fail to do so timely or on commercially reasonable times.\nHowever, given the recent developments, we cannot assure you whether NASDAQ or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements.\nThe SEC may propose additional rules or guidance that could impact us if our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. For example, on August 6, 2020, the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets, or the PWG, issued the Report on Protecting United States Investors from Significant Risks from Chinese Companies to the then President of the United States. This report recommended the SEC implement five recommendations to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to fulfil its statutory mandate. Some of the concepts of these recommendations were implemented with the enactment of the HFCA Act. However, some of the recommendations were more stringent than the HFCA Act. For example, if a company\u2019s auditor was not subject to PCAOB inspection, the report recommended that the transition period before a company would be delisted would end on January 1, 2022.\nThe SEC had announced that the SEC staff was preparing a consolidated proposal for the rules regarding the implementation of the HFCA Act and to address the recommendations in the PWG report. The implications of possible additional regulation in addition to the requirements of the HFCA Act and what was recently adopted on December 2, 2021 are uncertain. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our shares to be materially and adversely affected, and our securities could be delisted or prohibited from being traded on the national securities exchange earlier than would be required by the HFCAA. If our shares are unable to be listed on another securities exchange by then, such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our shares when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our shares.\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our future business and operations.\nOur business direction going forward is focused in the Asia region which, accordingly, could place our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects be influenced to a certain degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies.\nThe Chinese government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect our future business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our future business and operating results.\nInterpretation of PRC laws and the implementation of National Security Law in Hong Kong involve uncertainty.\nThe PRC\u2019s legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions can only be used as a reference. Since 1979, the PRC\u2019s government has promulgated laws and regulations in relation to economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, with a view to developing a comprehensive system of commercial law, including laws relating to property ownership and development. However, due to the fact that these laws and regulations have not been fully developed, and because of the limited volume of published cases and the non-binding nature of prior court decisions, interpretation of PRC\u2019s laws and regulations involves a degree of uncertainty. Some of these laws may be changed with little advance notice, without immediate publication or may be amended with retroactive effect.\nOn June 30, 2020, China\u2019s top legislature unanimously passed a new National Security Law for Hong Kong that was enacted on the same day. Similar to PRC\u2019s laws and regulations, the interpretation of National Security Law involves a degree of uncertainty.\nDepending on the government agency or how an application or case is presented to such agency, we may receive less favorable interpretations of laws and regulations than our competitors, particularly if a competitor has long been established in the locality of, and has developed a relationship with such agency. In addition, any litigation may be protracted and result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management attention. All of these uncertainties may cause difficulties in the enforcement of our land use rights, entitlements under our permits and other statutory and contractual rights and interests.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption law.\nIn connection with any future offering, we may be subjected to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We may also be subjected to Chinese anti-corruption laws, which strictly prohibit the payment of bribes to government officials. Going forward Hong Kong and China subsidiaries may have operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales in China, which may experience corruption. Our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries\u2019 future activities in China may create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of their employees, because sometimes these employees are out of our control. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect their business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nThe PRC government may issue further restrictive measures in the future.\nWe cannot assure you that the PRC\u2019s government will not issue further restrictive measures in the future. The PRC government\u2019s restrictive regulations and measures could increase our existing and future operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures, limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our existing and future business operations, which could further adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur Hong Kong and China subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of laws and other obligations regarding cybersecurity and data protection, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and obligations could have a material and adverse effect on their business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Hong Kong and China subsidiaries may be subject relating various risks and costs associated with to the collection, use, sharing, retention, security, and transfer of confidential and private information, such as personal information and other data. This data is wide ranging and relates to our investors, employees, contractors and other counterparties and third parties. The relevant PRC laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us, our subsidiaries and other parties with which we/they have commercial relations.\nThe PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to privacy and data security is evolving. The PRC Cybersecurity Law which was promulgated on November 7, 2016 and became effective on June 1, 2017 provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities in April 2020, which became effective in June 2020, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. If they provide or are deemed to provide such network products and services to critical information infrastructure operators, or they are deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator, they would be required to follow cybersecurity review procedures. There can be no assurance that they would be able to complete the applicable cybersecurity review procedures in a timely manner, or at all, if they are required to follow such procedures. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures may prevent them from using or providing certain network products and services, and may result in fines of up to ten times the purchase price of such network products and services being imposed upon us, if they are to be deemed a critical information infrastructure operator using network products or services without having completed the required cybersecurity review procedures. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period.\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of China promulgated the Data Security Law which shall take effect in September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations of entities and individuals carrying out data activities, prohibits entities and individuals in China from providing any foreign judicial or law enforcement authority with any data stored in China without approval from the competent PRC authority, and sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations, including rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB10 million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress adopted the Personal Information Security Law, which shall come into force as of November 1, 2021. The Personal Information Protection Law includes the basic rules for personal information processing, the rules for cross-border provision of personal information, the rights of individuals in personal information processing activities, the obligations of personal information processors, and the legal responsibilities for illegal collection, processing, and use of personal information.\nIn addition, on July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) for public comments, which proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess personal data of more than one million users. The PRC National Security Law covers various types of national security, including technology security and information security.\nOur Hong Kong and China subsidiaries do not collect, process or use personal information of entities or individuals other than what is necessary for our business and do not disseminate such information. They do not operate mobile apps and they do not possess information on more than a million entities/individuals. Although we believe they currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, they face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules, and if required, whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all.\nCompliance with the PRC Cybersecurity Law, the PRC National Security Law, the Data Security Law, the Personal Information Protection Law, the Cybersecurity Review Measures, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, including data security and personal information protection laws, may result in additional expenses to us and subject us to negative publicity, which could harm our reputation among users and negatively affect the trading price of our shares in the future. There are also uncertainties with respect to how the PRC Cybersecurity Law, the PRC National Security Law and the Data Security Law will be implemented and interpreted in practice. PRC regulators, including the Ministry of Public Security, the MIIT, the SAMR and the Cyberspace Administration of China, have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection, including for mobile apps, and are enhancing the protection of privacy and data security by rule-making and enforcement actions at central and local levels. We expect that these areas will receive greater and continued attention and scrutiny from regulators and the public going forward, which could increase our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries\u2019 compliance costs and subject them to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries are unable to manage these risks, they could become subject to penalties, including fines, suspension of business, prohibition against new user registration (even for a short period of time) and revocation of required licenses, and their reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIt may be difficult for overseas shareholders and/or regulators to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator, such as the Department of Justice, the SEC, the PCAOB and other authorities, to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests.\nSome of our business operations are conducted in Hong Kong and the PRC through our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries. In the event that the U.S. regulators carry out investigation on us and there is a need to conduct investigation or collect evidence within the territory of the PRC, the U.S. regulators may not be able to carry out such investigation or evidence collection directly in the PRC under the PRC laws. The U.S. regulators may consider cross-border cooperation with securities regulatory authority of the PRC by way of judicial assistance, diplomatic channels or regulatory cooperation mechanism established with the securities regulatory authority of the PRC.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business in China could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business.\nOur Hong Kong and China subsidiaries\u2019 business is subject to regulation by various governmental agencies in China, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with various legal obligations, such as value-added telecommunication laws and regulations, privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations, intellectual property laws, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, governmental trade laws, import and export controls, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in China. These laws and regulations impose added costs on their business. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject them to:\n\u25cf investigations, enforcement actions, and sanctions;\n\u25cf mandatory changes to our network and products;\n\u25cf disgorgement of profits, fines, and damages;\n\u25cf civil and criminal penalties or injunctions;\n\u25cf claims for damages by our customers or channel partners;\n\u25cf termination of contracts;\n\u25cf loss of intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf failure to obtain, maintain or renew certain licenses, approvals, permits, registrations or filings\n\u25cf necessary to conduct our operations; and\n\u25cf temporary or permanent debarment from sales to public service organizations.\nIf any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if they do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, their business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology industry have recently experienced increased regulatory scrutiny. Any similar reviews by regulatory agencies or legislatures may result in substantial regulatory fines, changes to their business practices, and other penalties, which could negatively affect their business and results of operations.\nChanges in social, political, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may cause them to change their business practices. Further, their expansion into a variety of new fields also could raise a number of new regulatory issues. These factors could negatively affect their business and results of operations in material ways.\nMoreover, they are exposed to the risk of misconduct, errors and failure to functions by their management, employees and parties that they collaborate with, who may from time to time be subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings or otherwise face potential liability and penalties in relation to noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, which could harm their reputation and business.\nThe recent joint statement by the SEC, proposed rule changes submitted by NASDAQ, and an act passed by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. These developments could add uncertainties to our future offerings, business operations share price and reputation.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud.\nOn December 7, 2018, the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the U.S. regulators in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. On April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China, reiterating past SEC and PCAOB statements on matters including the difficulty associated with inspecting accounting firms and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets and the difficulty of bringing and enforcing SEC, Department of Justice and other U.S. regulatory actions, including in instances of fraud, in emerging markets generally.\nOn May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (\u201cHFCAA\u201d) requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the company\u2019s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer\u2019s securities are prohibited to trade on a national exchange. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the HFCAA. On December 18, 2020, the HFCAA Act was signed into law. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. The SEC will implement a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction and will also require disclosure in the registrant\u2019s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence on, such a registrant.\nOn May 21, 2021, NASDAQ filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in a \u201cRestrictive Market\u201d, (ii) prohibit Restrictive Market companies from directly listing on NASDAQ Capital Market, and only permit them to list on NASDAQ Global Select or NASDAQ Global Market in connection with a direct listing and (iii) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company\u2019s auditors.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) is unable to inspect or investigate (\u201cCommission-Identified Issuers\u201d). The final amendments require Commission-Identified Issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that, if true, it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in the public accounting firm\u2019s foreign jurisdiction. The amendments also require that a Commission-Identified Issuer that is a \u201cforeign issuer,\u201d as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide certain additional disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of its consolidated foreign operating entities. Further, the release provides notice regarding the procedures the SEC has established to identify issuers and to impose trading prohibitions on the securities of certain Commission-Identified Issuers, as required by the HFCAA.\nThe SEC will identify Commission-Identified Issuers for fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2020. A Commission-Identified Issuer will be required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified. If a registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nThese recent developments could add uncertainties to our offering and we cannot assure you whether NASDAQ or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements.\nIt remains unclear what further actions the SEC, the PCAOB or NASDAQ will take to address these issues and what impact those actions will have on U.S. companies that have significant operations in the PRC and have securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange (including a national securities exchange or over-the-counter stock market). In addition, the March 2021 interim final amendments and any additional actions, proceedings, or new rules resulting from these efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could create some uncertainty for investors, the market price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected, and we could be delisted if we and our auditor are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement or being required to engage a new audit firm, which would require significant expense and management time.\nAs a result of these scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on us, our future offerings, business and our share price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our Company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from developing our growth. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, we and our business operations will be severely affected and you could sustain a significant decline in the value of our shares.\nNASDAQ may apply additional and more stringent criteria for our continued listing.\nNASDAQ Listing Rule 5101 provides NASDAQ with broad discretionary authority over the continued listing of securities in NASDAQ and NASDAQ may use such discretion to deny apply additional or more stringent criteria for the continued listing of particular securities, or suspend or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs that makes continued listing of the securities on NASDAQ inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of NASDAQ, even though the securities meet all enumerated criteria for continued listing on NASDAQ. In addition, NASDAQ has used its discretion to deny continued listing or to apply additional and more stringent criteria in the instances, including but not limited to where the company engaged an auditor that has not been subject to an inspection by PCAOB, an auditor that PCAOB cannot inspect, or an auditor that has not demonstrated sufficient resources, geographic reach, or experience to adequately perform the company\u2019s audit. For the aforementioned concerns, we may be subject to the additional and more stringent criteria of NASDAQ for our continued listing.\nThe current tension in international trade, particularly with regard to U.S. and China trade policies, may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough cross-border business may not be an area of our focus, if we plan to expand our business internationally in the future, any unfavorable government policies on international trade, such as capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for our services, impact our competitive position, or prevent us from being able to conduct business in certain countries. If any new tariffs, legislation, or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Recently, there have been heightened tensions in international economic relations, such as the one between the United States and China. The U.S. government has recently imposed, and has recently proposed to impose additional, new, or higher tariffs on certain products imported from China to penalize China for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices. China has responded by imposing, and proposing to impose additional, new, or higher tariffs on certain products imported from the United States. Following mutual retaliatory actions for months, on January 15, 2020, the United States and China entered into the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People\u2019s Republic of China as a phase one trade deal, effective on February 14, 2020.\nAlthough the direct impact of the current international trade tension, and any escalation of such tension, on the industries in which we operate is uncertain, the negative impact on general, economic, political and social conditions may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Hong Kong legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to the Company.\nHong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the PRC and enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\u2019s constitutional document, the Basic Law, ensures that the current political situation will remain in effect for 50 years. Hong Kong has enjoyed the freedom to function in a high degree of autonomy for its affairs, including currencies, immigration and custom, independent judiciary system and parliamentary system. However, we are not in any position to guarantee the implementation of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle and the level of autonomy as currently in place at the moment. Any changes in the state of political environment in Hong Kong may materially and adversely affect our business and operation. Additionally, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in Hong Kong may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us, including our ability to enforce our agreements with our clients\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in the de-listing of our Common Stock.\nOn January 3, 2022, we received notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that, because the closing bid price for our common stock has fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we no longer comply with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). However the Nasdaq Listing Rules also provide us a compliance period of 180 calendar days (i.e. by July 5, 2022) in which to regain compliance. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, including the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so.\nThe Company is considering actions that it may take in response to this notification to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements, but no decisions about a response have been made as of the date of this report.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of the shares of Common Stock by existing shareholders could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nIf our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of the shares, then the market price of our Common Stock could fall. Such sales by our existing shareholders might make it more difficult for us to issue new equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and place we deem appropriate. If any existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of shares, the prevailing market price for our shares could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our shares is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf variations in our actual and perceived operating results;\n\u25cf news regarding gains or losses of customers or partners by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf news regarding gains or losses of key personnel by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of competitive developments, acquisitions or strategic alliances in our industry by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u25cf potential litigation;\n\u25cf general market conditions or other developments affecting us or our industry; and\n\u25cf the operating and stock price performance of other companies, other industries and other events or factors beyond our control.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of certain companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the shares.\nIn case that our shares trade under $5.00 per share they will be considered penny stock. Trading in penny stocks has many restrictions and these restrictions could severely affect the price and liquidity of our shares.\nIf our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our Common Stock would be considered as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established Members and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our Common Stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stocks is often volatile, and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Presently, we intend to retain all our earnings, if any, to finance development and expansion of our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our Common Stock appreciates.\nTogether, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Chong Kuang, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert own a large percentage of our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of our corporate matters.\nMr. Lee Chong Kuang, our CEO, beneficially owns 22.10% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, and Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert, our CFO, beneficially owns 13.54% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, Messrs. Lee and Loke are collectively able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain shareholder approval, including the election of directors to our board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership in our shares by executive officers will limit the other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.", "PERMNO": 17885, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "GRNQ"}
