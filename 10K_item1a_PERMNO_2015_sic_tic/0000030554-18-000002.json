{"cik": "30554", "company": "DUPONT E I DE NEMOURS & CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe company's operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond its control. Based on current information, the company believes that the following identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect its operations. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThe Benefits of the Merger May Not be Fully Realized. Combining the Businesses of DuPont and Dow May Be More Difficult, Costly or Time-Consuming than Expected, Which May Adversely Affect DuPont's Results.\nThe success of the Merger depends on, among other things, DowDuPont's ability to combine the DuPont and Dow businesses in a manner that facilitates the intended separation of the combined company's agriculture, materials science and specialty products businesses through one or more tax-efficient transactions (the \"Intended Business Separations\"), resulting in three independent, publicly traded companies, and realizes anticipated synergies.\nDuPont expects to benefit from significant cost synergies at both the product line and corporate levels through the Synergy Program which is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Intended Business Separations, including through the achievement of production cost efficiencies, enhancement of the agricultural supply chain, elimination of duplicative agricultural research and development programs, optimization of the combined company\u2019s global footprint across manufacturing, sales and research and development in the materials science business, optimizing manufacturing processes in the electronics space, the reduction of corporate and leveraged services costs, and the realization of significant procurement synergies. In connection with the Synergy Program, DuPont expects to record total pretax restructuring charges of $430 million to $600 million, comprised of approximately $320 million to $360 million of severance and related benefit costs; $110 million to $140 million of costs related to contract terminations; and up to $100 million of asset related charges.\nManagement also expects the combined company will achieve growth synergies and other meaningful savings and benefits as a result of the Intended Business Separations.\nCombining DuPont and Dow's independent businesses and preparing for the Intended Business Separations are complex, costly and time-consuming processes and the management of DowDuPont may face significant implementation challenges, many of which may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nongoing diversion of the attention of management from the operation of the combined company\u2019s business as a result of the Intended Business Separations;\n\u2022\nimpact of portfolio changes between materials science and specialty products on integration and separation preparation activities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration or separation process, including with respect to the intended tax efficient transactions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating, replicating or separating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a larger combined company, addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nmanaging tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company and the intended tax efficient separation transactions; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations.\nSome of these factors will be outside of the control of DowDuPont, DuPont and Dow, and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact business, financial condition and results of operations. The integration and Intended Businesses Separation processes and other disruptions, including those from divestitures and acquisitions undertaken in connection with securing regulatory approval for the Merger, as well as those from the portfolio changes between the materials science and specialty products businesses, may also adversely affect the combined company\u2019s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and others with whom DuPont and Dow have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of DuPont and Dow could harm the reputation of DowDuPont, DuPont and Dow.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nIf DowDuPont is not able to successfully combine the businesses of DuPont and Dow in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings, including from the Synergy Program, of the Merger (including the Intended Business Separations) may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of DowDuPont common stock, the revenues, levels of expenses and results of operations may be affected adversely. A variety of factors may adversely affect DowDuPont's ability to realize the currently expected synergies, savings and other benefits of the Merger, including failure to successfully optimize the combined company's facilities footprint, the failure to take advantage of the combined company's global supply chain, the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs, and the failure to otherwise integrate DuPont's or Dow's respective businesses, including their technology platforms.\nDuPont Will Incur Significant Transaction Costs in Connection with the Integration of Dow and DuPont.\nThere are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Merger and replicated, transferred or separated in connection with the Intended Business Separations. While DuPont has assumed a certain level of expenses, including in connection with the Synergy Program, would be incurred in connection with the Merger and the Intended Business Separations, there are many factors beyond the combined company\u2019s control that could affect the total amount of, or the timing of, anticipated expenses with respect to the integration and implementation of the combined businesses.\nThere may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Merger and the Intended Business Separations that DuPont may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional income DuPont expects to achieve from the Merger. Although DuPont expects that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\nInability to Access the Debt Capital Markets Could Impair DuPont's Liquidity, Business or Financial Condition.\nDowDuPont\u2019s primary sources of liquidity are through DuPont and Dow and their respective consolidated subsidiaries, (collectively, the \u201cSubsidiaries\u201d). Each of DuPont and Dow has relied and continues to rely on access to the debt capital markets to finance their day-to-day and long-term operations. In connection with the Merger, DowDuPont has not incurred debt obligations or guaranteed the debt obligations of Dow or DuPont. Any limitation on the part of either DuPont\u2019s or Dow's ability to raise money in the debt markets could have a substantial negative effect on their respective liquidity and the liquidity of DowDuPont. Access to the debt capital markets in amounts adequate to finance each company\u2019s activities could be impaired as a result of the existence of material nonpublic information about the Intended Business Separations and other potential factors, including factors that are not specific to the companies, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and interest rate fluctuations.\nPrior to the Intended Business Separations, if pursued, the level and quality of the respective earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, of each of DuPont and Dow will impact their respective credit ratings, costs and availability of financing and those of the combined company. A decrease in the ratings assigned to DuPont or Dow by the ratings agencies may negatively impact their access to the debt capital markets and increase the combined company\u2019s cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that DuPont and Dow will maintain their current credit worthiness or prospective credit ratings. Any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the liquidity, capital position or access to capital markets of DuPont and Dow and, therefore, DowDuPont.\nThe Costs of Complying with Evolving Regulatory Requirements Could Negatively Impact the Company's Financial Results. Actual or Alleged Violations of Environmental Laws or Permit Requirements Could Result in Restrictions or Prohibitions on Plant Operations, Substantial Civil or Criminal Sanctions, as well as the Assessment of Strict Liability and/or Joint and Several Liability.\nThe company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company's operations, or require modifications to its facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nIncreased Concerns Regarding the Safe Use of Seeds with Biotechnology Traits, Crop Protection Products and Chemicals in General, in Commerce and their Potential Impact on the Environment as well as Perceived Impacts of Biotechnology on Health and the Environment, have Resulted in More Restrictive Regulations and could Lead to New Regulations.\nConcerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits, crop protection products, and chemicals in general, their potential impact on health and the environment, and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment, reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These concerns and claims include those that increased use of crop protection products, related drift and volatilization, and of biotechnology traits to address resistance of weeds and pests to control by crop protection products, could increase such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment. These concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing, delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals, delayed product launches, lack of market acceptance, product discontinuation, continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation. These concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability or continued sales of certain of the company's products, the company's reputation and the cost to comply with regulations. These concerns could have a negative impact on the company's results of operations.\nIn most jurisdictions, the company must test the safety, efficacy and environmental impact of its agricultural products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the necessary approvals. In certain jurisdictions, the company must periodically renew its approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with then-current standards. The regulatory environment is lengthy, complex and in some markets unpredictable, with requirements that can vary by product, technology, industry and country. The regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of non-governmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new technology, products or processes on safety, health and the environment. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance.\nResponding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. The failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near- and long-term effects on the company\u2019s ability to produce and sell some current and future products.\nTo maintain its right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products containing biotechnology traits, particularly seed products, the company must be able to demonstrate its ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies. Sales into and use of seeds with biotechnology traits in jurisdictions where cultivation has been approved could be impacted if key import markets have not approved the import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds. If import of grains, food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds containing such biotechnology traits occurs in these markets, it could lead to disruption in trade and potential liability for the company.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s regulatory compliance could be affected by the detection of low level presence of biotechnology traits in conventional seed or products produced from such seed. Furthermore, the detection of biotechnology traits not approved in the country of cultivation may affect the company\u2019s ability to supply product and could affect exports of products produced from such seeds and even result in crop destruction or product recalls.\nAn Impairment of Goodwill or Intangibles Assets could Negatively Impact the company's Financial Results.\nAs a result of the Merger and the related accounting determination, DuPont elected to apply push-down accounting and has reflected the acquisition date fair value of assets and liabilities in its Successor Consolidated Financial Statements, including a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets. The company assesses both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. The company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is required. If quantitative testing indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Since the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, continued weak demand for a specific product line could result in an impairment. As a result of the application of push-down accounting, the carrying value of the company\u2019s assets approximates fair value therefore increasing the risk of impairments. Future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could be recorded in results of operations due to changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances and there can be no assurance that such impairments would be immaterial to the company.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThe Determination to Proceed with the Intended Business Separations is a Decision of the DowDuPont Board of Directors and the Expected Benefits of Such Transactions, if They Occur, Will Be Uncertain.\nIn the event that the DowDuPont board determines to proceed with the Intended Business Separations, it is currently anticipated that any such Intended Business Separation transaction would be effectuated through two pro-rata spin-off transactions, in which DowDuPont stockholders, at such time, would receive shares of capital stock in the resulting spin-off companies, resulting in three independent, public companies. The DowDuPont board may ultimately determine to abandon one or more of the Intended Business Separation transactions, and such determination could have an adverse impact on DowDuPont, DuPont, and Dow. There are many factors that could, prior to the determination by the DowDuPont board to proceed with the Intended Business Separations, impact the structure or timing of, the anticipated benefits from, or determination to ultimately proceed with, the Intended Business Separations, including, among others, global economic conditions, instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile foreign currency exchange rates, tax considerations, and other challenges that could affect the global economy, specific market conditions in one or more of the industries of the businesses proposed to be separated, and changes in the regulatory or legal environment. Such changes could adversely impact the value of one or more of the Intended Business Separation transactions to the combined company\u2019s stockholders. Additionally, to the extent the DowDuPont board determines to proceed with the Intended Business Separations, the consummation of such transactions is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and there can be no guarantee that the intended benefits of such transactions will be achieved. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Intended Business Separations, as well as any delays encountered in the process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the agriculture business, the specialty products business, the materials science business and/or the combined company.\nThe Company\u2019s Operations Outside the United States are Subject to Risks and Restrictions, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition, and Cash Flows.\nThe company\u2019s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, including fluctuations in currency values and foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Although DuPont has operations throughout the world, sales outside the U.S. in 2017 were principally to customers in Eurozone countries, China, Brazil, and Japan. Further, the company\u2019s largest currency exposures are the European euro, the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real, and the Japanese yen. Market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these geographic areas could reduce demand for the company\u2019s products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on DuPont\u2019s results of operations. In addition, changes in exchange rates may affect the company\u2019s results from operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. The company actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, committed currency purchases and sales, foreign currency-denominated revenues and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business.\nVolatility in Energy and Raw Materials Costs Could Have a Significant Impact on the Company's Sales and Earnings.\nThe company's manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the control of the company. Significant variations in the cost of energy, which primarily reflect market prices for oil, natural gas, and raw materials affect the company's operating results from period to period. Legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a price on carbon could create increases in energy costs and price volatility.\nWhen possible, the company purchases raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. Additionally, the company enters into over-the-counter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. The company takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. If the company is not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs, it could have a significant impact on the company's financial results.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThe Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could be Seriously Impacted by Business Disruptions and Security Breaches, Including Cybersecurity Incidents.\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions, plant and/or power outages and information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of cause including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm the company's operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased stakeholder concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could result in misuse of the company's assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance. Like most major corporations, the company is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks, from time to time. The company has determined that these attacks have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to at least certain confidential business information. However, to date, the company has not experienced any material financial impact, changes in the competitive environment or business operations that it attributes to these attacks. Although management does not believe that the company has experienced any material losses to date related to security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer such losses in the future. The company actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, the company may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUnpredictable Seasonal and Weather Factors Could Impact Sales and Earnings from the Company\u2019s Agriculture Product Line.\nThe agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors, which can vary unpredictably from period to period. Weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and, accordingly, can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products, including the mix of products used. The weather also can affect the quality, volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix. Seed yields can be higher or lower than planned, which could lead to higher inventory and related write-offs and affect the ability to supply.\nInability to Discover, Develop and Protect New Technologies and Enforce the Company's Intellectual Property Rights, and to Respond to New Technologies Could Adversely Affect the Company's Financial Results.\nThe company competes with major global companies that have strong intellectual property rights, including rights supporting the use of biotechnology to enhance products, particularly agricultural and bio-based products. Speed in discovering, developing, protecting, and responding to new technologies, including new technology-based distribution channels that could impede the company's ability to engage with customers and end users, and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage. Failure to predict and respond effectively could cause the company's existing or candidate products to become less competitive, adversely affecting sales. Competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain. If challenges are resolved adversely, it could negatively impact the company's ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, plant variety protection, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, tradenames and other forms of trade dress, are important to the company's business. The company endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported. However, the company may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Further, changes in government policies and regulations, including changes made in reaction to pressure from non-governmental organizations, could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions.\nThe majority of the company\u2019s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that are licensed from third parties under long-term licenses. If the company loses its rights under such licenses, it could negatively impact the company's ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThe company has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict access to and distribution of its intellectual property. Despite these precautions, the company's intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches. When unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered, the company reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation, as appropriate, and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact. Protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating. Accordingly, the impact of such theft can be significant.\nFailure to Effectively Manage Acquisitions, Divestitures, Alliances and Other Portfolio Actions Could Adversely Impact Our Future Results.\nThe company made certain divestitures, primarily related to its agriculture product line, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the Merger. In addition, the company had a recent acquisition and from time to time evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit its business and/or growth objectives. If the company is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, the company could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increases in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial results. The company continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to the company\u2019s objectives and alignment with its growth strategy. However, the company may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect the company\u2019s earnings. Moreover, the company might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings. In addition, if the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact the company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company's Business, Including its Results of Operations and Reputation, Could be Adversely Affected by Process Safety and Product Stewardship Issues.\nFailure to appropriately manage safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks associated with the company's products, product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees, communities, stakeholders, the environment, the company's reputation and its results of operations. Public perception of the risks associated with the company's products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which the company operates. While the company has procedures and controls to manage process safety risks, issues could be created by events outside of its control including natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage and substandard performance by third parties with which the company collaborates.\nDuPont\u2019s Results of Operations Could Be Adversely Affected by Environmental, Litigation and Other Commitments and Contingencies.\nThe company is subject to various laws and regulations around the world governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances. As a result of its operations, including its past operations and operations of divested businesses, the company could incur substantial costs, including remediation and restoration costs. The costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. The company's accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.\nAt December 31, 2017, the company had accrued obligations of $433 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost could range up to $920 million above that amount. This includes matters with an aggregate estimated liability range from $242 up to $430 million above that amount for which the company is indemnified by Chemours. At December 31, 2017, the company had recognized a liability of $433 million and an indemnification asset of $242 million for environmental contingencies. If the company could no longer continue to recognize the related indemnification asset due to potential disputes related to recovery or solvency of Chemours, it could adversely impact DuPont\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThe company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including, but not limited to, product liability, patent infringement, antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company has noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental torts without claiming present personal injuries. The company also has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment, including waterways and watersheds. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the company's financial results. Various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the company may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations. If the company were required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued, thereby adversely affecting the company's results of operations.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement, Chemours indemnifies DuPont against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. If the company could no longer continue to recognize the related indemnification asset due to potential disputes related to recovery or solvency of Chemours, it could adversely impact DuPont\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on environmental, litigation and other commitments and contingencies faced by the company.\nPart I", "PERMNO": 11703, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "DD.2"}
