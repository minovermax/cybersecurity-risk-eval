{"cik": "96831", "company": "TECUMSEH PRODUCTS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are descriptions of material risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements contained in this report. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary statements concerning forward-looking statements in this report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section in Item 7 below, \u201cCautionary Statements Relating To Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d should be considered in addition to the following statements.\nWe have a history of losses and might not maintain our current level of liquidity.\nOur cash position has become increasingly important in light of constrained capital markets and the current economic environment. Our cash position has not been generated from operations but instead by non-recurring divestitures, new financing arrangements and pension plan reversions. However, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of liquidity. We have incurred losses in seven of our last eight years, including 2014, and would have incurred a loss in 2012 if we had not recognized a $45.0 million postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the termination of certain postretirement benefits for salaried employees and retirees. We believe we will continue to incur net losses for the next several years. Challenges remain with respect to our ability to generate appropriate levels of liquidity solely from cash flows from operations, in particular due to uncertainties related to future sales levels, global economic conditions, currency exchange effects and commodity pricing. We may not be able to generate cash from operating activities unless further restructuring activities are implemented or sales or economic conditions improve. Additional restructuring activities may be necessary and might include changing our current footprint, consolidating facilities, otherwise reducing our manufacturing capacity, selling assets or reducing the number of our employees. These actions could result in significant restructuring or asset impairment charges, severance costs, losses on asset sales and use of cash. Accordingly, these restructuring activities could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position, operating profit, cash flows and future operating results. While we believe that current cash balances, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, proceeds from sales of assets and cash inflows related to non-income tax refunds will produce adequate liquidity to implement our business strategy over at least the next twelve months, there is a risk that the costs of any such restructuring and cash required will exceed the benefits received from such activities or that such benefits will ultimately be inadequate if sales or economic conditions deteriorate. In addition, while our business dispositions in prior years have improved our liquidity, many of the sale agreements provide for certain retained liabilities and indemnities, including liabilities that relate to environmental issues and product warranties. Future events could result in the recognition of additional liabilities that could consume available liquidity and management attention.\nIf we are unable to develop successful new products, our sales could be adversely affected and we might not be profitable.\nIf we are unable to develop and successfully market competitive products, our sales volumes could be adversely affected and we might not be profitable. Products in our markets are relatively undifferentiated and new products are continuously introduced to the market. Our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and on our ability to successfully develop products that comply with new regulations and timely identify, develop, manufacture, market, and sell new or improved products in these changing markets. If we fail to do so, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCurrent and future global or regional political and economic conditions, including credit markets, could have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, liquidity and profitability.\nOur sales volumes, liquidity and profitability depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values. The global recession precipitated by the financial crisis and subsequent weak and uncertain global economy had a detrimental effect on our sales volumes over the last several years, and a related detrimental effect on our liquidity and profitability. A number of factors, including, but not limited to, gross domestic product, availability of consumer credit, interest rates, consumer confidence, unemployment levels, debt levels, retail trends, housing starts, inventory levels, commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates, generally affect demand for our products. In the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets and a lack of credit availability for us. This could have a number of effects on our business, including the inability of end customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of products containing our products, and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions. A further decline in economic activity and conditions, or continued volatility in global economic conditions in the U.S., Brazil, Europe, Asia and the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including our sales volumes, liquidity and profitability.\nRegional economic conditions can also have an adverse effect on our sales volumes and our costs, with a resulting adverse impact on our liquidity and profitability. The prolonged stagnation and political disruption in the Euro zone, which has impacted other economies in the region, uncertainties surrounding the conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East and concerns about market fundamentals in many of the world's largest economies have contributed to a lack of growth in each of these markets. If these uncertainties continue, our financial condition and results of operations, including our sales volumes, liquidity and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively improve productivity and restructure our operations in order to reduce costs and bring them in line with projected production levels and product mix, we might not be profitable.\nIf we are unable to improve productivity and restructure to reduce costs we might not be profitable. Our ability to make these improvements depends on our success in implementing lean manufacturing processes and reducing waste, addressing our excess capacity and high fixed cost base, optimizing headcount, enhancing the design of our products to increase manufacturing efficiency and using lower cost materials. Restructuring and realignment of our manufacturing operations and personnel or system implementations might cause business disruptions and might not result in the expected amount of savings or make us profitable.\nThe loss of, or substantial decline in sales to, any of our key customers, including Electrolux or Whirlpool, could adversely affect our sales volumes, profitability and liquidity.\nIn 2014, our largest customers, Electrolux and Whirlpool Corporation, both of whom were primarily R&F customers, accounted for 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively of consolidated net sales. Loss of either of these customers, or substantial declines in sales to either of them, could have an adverse effect on our sales volumes and our resulting profitability and liquidity. Generally, we do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers, making it easier for the customer to change volume among suppliers. Larger customers may also seek to use their position to improve their performance by various means, including improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to meet their requirements, our sales volume and related profitability and liquidity could be negatively affected. Additionally, the loss of market share or financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, by these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nIncreased or unexpected product warranty claims could adversely affect us.\nWe provide our customers a warranty on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 36 months. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, future warranty claims might not follow historical patterns or we might not accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, in 2014 and 2013, we incurred $11.4 million and $14.5 million, respectively in expenses to replace defective products shipped to customers, as we experienced two major quality issues that were originally identified in 2013.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nAll of the compressor and condensing unit markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of efficiency, price, sound level, refrigerant, delivery, reliability, availability and service, as well as compliance with various environmental and regional safety standards and regulations. For most applications there are numerous competitors, some of which offer more products and have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, research and development and management resources than we do. Products in some markets are relatively undifferentiated and competitors are continuously introducing new products. If our products do not meet or exceed the attributes of our competitors' offerings, we could be at a disadvantage in the affected product lines. These and other factors might have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, we operate in environments where worldwide productive capacities exceed global demand and customers and competitors are establishing new productive capacities in low cost countries. These trends have put downward pressure on prices and in some cases have resulted in us losing market share. These trends may also result in the need for us to restructure our operations further by removing excess capacities and engaging in joint ventures with manufacturers in low cost countries. There is no guarantee that these initiatives, which could include plant closures, reductions in the number of our employees, asset sales and expanded operations in low cost countries, would improve our profitability in the future.\nOur international operations subject us to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe are exposed to significant exchange rate risk because the majority of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are derived from operations conducted outside the U.S. in local and other currencies and, for purposes of financial reporting, the results are translated into U.S. Dollars based on currency exchange rates prevailing during or at the end of the reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. Dollar, our reported net revenues and net income (loss) and assets are reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. Dollars, and during times of a weakening U.S. Dollar, our reported expenses and liabilities are increased because the local currency will translate into more U.S. Dollars. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against major currencies could materially affect our financial results.\nWe are also exposed to significant exchange rate risk when an operation has sales or expense transactions in a currency that differs from its local, functional currency or when the sales and expenses are denominated in different currencies. Since our primary risk stems from sales transacted at foreign locations which have the resulting receivable denominated in U.S. Dollars, this risk affects our business adversely when the Brazilian Real, Euro or Indian Rupee strengthens against the U.S. Dollar. In these cases, when the receivable is ultimately paid in less valuable U.S. Dollars, the foreign location realizes less net revenue in its local currency, which can adversely impact its margins. We have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset these impacts, primarily hedging against transactional exposure where the risk of loss is greatest. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with short-term protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nUltimately, long term changes in currency exchange rates have lasting effects on the relative competitiveness of operations located in certain countries versus competitors located in different countries. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary - Currency Exchange\u201d and \u201c-Outlook\u201d and \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\u201d for a description of foreign currency volatility and a description of our hedging activity.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation and environmental claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential litigation and environmental claims, such as environmental clean-up obligations, resource damage claims and product liability suits that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our current products and some products that we sold in the past. We are also potentially exposed to litigation related to prior sales of businesses, securities laws, antitrust laws or other types of business disputes. Results of legal proceedings and environmental claims cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation and environmental claims can be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and can cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. We estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and the amount is reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid. Actual results may significantly vary from our reserves.\nWe self-insure a portion of product liability claims; an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim or series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our product reputation and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and our company.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty of litigation and environmental claims, we cannot be certain that existing litigation or environmental claims or any future adverse legal developments will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our legal matters.\nWe are subject to, and could be further subject to, governmental investigations and actions by other third parties relating to antitrust laws that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are one of several companies involved in investigations by government regulators in various jurisdictions into possible anti-competitive practices in the compressor industry. While we have entered into conditional amnesty agreements under which we do not expect to be subject to criminal prosecution with respect to the investigations, we are not exempt from civil litigation. We have been named as a defendant in numerous related class action lawsuits in various jurisdictions; these lawsuits seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors. Additional lawsuits could be filed in the future. The impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur global operations subject us to risks associated with changes in government regulations.\nOur international sales and operations, including our purchases of raw materials from international suppliers, are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, governmental expropriation and governmental regulations that may be disadvantageous to businesses owned by foreign nationals, and instabilities in the workforce due to changing political and social conditions. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. The ability to manage these risks can be difficult and may limit our operations, as well as cause the manufacture and sale of our products to become more difficult, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary - Liquidity\u201d and \u201cLiquidity Sources - Cash inflows related to taxes\u201d for a description of our outstanding refundable non-income taxes in Brazil and India.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in, or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. Actions of this nature, if they occur or continue for significant periods of time, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in any given period.\nWe are also subject to additional disclosure requirements, including conflict minerals disclosure requirements. Compliance with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, as well as divert management's attention away from running our business.\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive environmental laws and energy regulations.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. These regulations can vary widely across the countries in which we do business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, we could still be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing, previously divested, or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties, or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. See \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation - Environmental Matters\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for a description of our environmental matters.\nIn addition, governmental regulations control the types of refrigerants that may be utilized in our products, and this global scrutiny continues to evolve. We have continued to address these changes in regulations by approving and releasing new models that meet governmental and customer requirements. We also strive to have our products meet requirements for energy efficiency, which can vary substantially in the different geographic markets in which we sell our products. Future legislation may require substantial levels of expenditure to meet industry requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPrice volatility of commodities we purchase could have an adverse effect on our cash flow or results of operations.\nThe price of raw materials, such as steel, copper and aluminum are one of the most significant cost and cash flow impacts on our business. The prices of these commodities have been extremely volatile over the past few years and due to competitive markets, we are typically not able to quickly recover product cost increases through price increases or other cost savings. While we have been proactive in addressing volatility of these costs by using derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain raw materials, our hedged price could result in our paying higher or lower prices for commodities as compared to the market prices for those commodities when purchased and will not protect us against longer term price increases. Our hedges may also be ineffective in offsetting changes in spot commodity prices, increasing, rather than decreasing, our exposure to commodity price changes. Decreases in spot prices below our hedged prices can put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less hedged competitors and can also require us to post cash collateral with our hedge counterparties, which could impact our liquidity and cash flows. At December 31, 2014, we were required to post $0.6 million of cash collateral on our commodity hedges. In addition, increases in steel prices have a particularly negative impact as there is currently no well-established global market for hedging against increases in the cost of steel. Continued volatility of commodities or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity may negatively impact our results of operations. Our hedging activities might not be successful to manage our costs. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary - Commodities\u201d and \u201c-Outlook\u201d and \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk\u201d for a description of raw material price volatility and a description of our hedging activity.\nSignificant supply interruptions could have an adverse effect on our cash flow or results of operations.\nWe generally concentrate purchases for a given raw material or component with a small number of suppliers. Although we believe there are alternative suppliers for all of our key raw material and component needs, if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our supply requirements, we could experience supply interruptions or cost increases, either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our success.\nWe benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability if we are unable to secure adequate replacement personnel.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 5,200 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 1,000 temporary employees and contractors worldwide. The majority of people we employ on a full time and temporary basis are in foreign locations and approximately 4,800 are represented by national trade unions. While we do not believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters, future issues with our labor unions might not be resolved favorably and we might encounter future strikes, further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers could result in slow-downs or closures at their plants where our products are installed. If one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA breach in cyber security relating to our information technology systems or failures of third-party technology service providers to perform effectively could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and operate our business. A breach in cyber security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations.\nIn addition, we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions, such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration, to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or harm employee morale, which, in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations.\nOur financial statements may be impacted by future changes in accounting rules and requirements, and these changes may be costly to implement.\nFuture changes in accounting rules and disclosure requirements could significantly impact our reported financial results and the comparability of financial statements. We constantly monitor new accounting proposals under development by the standard setting bodies. Potential future changes in accounting rules and regulations could be time-consuming and costly to implement.", "PERMNO": 77722, "SIC": 3585, "TIC": "TECU"}
