{"cik": "1418133", "company": "Biostar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described here. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have limited sources of working capital and will need substantial additional financing\nWorking capital required to implement our business plan will most likely be provided by funds obtained through offerings of our equity, debt, debt-linked securities, and/or equity-linked securities, and revenues generated by us. No assurance can be given that we will have revenues sufficient to support and sustain our operations or that we would be able to obtain equity/debt financing in the current economic environment. If we do not have sufficient working capital and are unable to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional funds, we may delay the completion of or significantly reduce the scope of our current business plan; delay some of our development and clinical or marketing efforts; postpone the hiring of new personnel; or, under certain dire financial circumstances, substantially curtail or cease our operations.\nOur current levels of working capital and the need for additional financing raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We may need substantial additional capital to fund our operations. To date, we have relied almost exclusively on organically generated revenues financing transactions to fund losses from our operations. Our inability to obtain sufficient additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan and, as a result, could require us to significantly curtail or potentially cease our operations. At December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.18 million, total current assets of approximately $7.4 million and total current liabilities of approximately $5.6 million. We will need to engage in capital-raising transactions in the near future. Such financing transactions may well cause substantial dilution to our shareholders and could involve the issuance of securities with rights senior to the outstanding shares. Our ability to complete additional financings is dependent on, among other things, the state of the capital markets at the time of any proposed offering, market reception of the Company and the likelihood of the success of its business model, of the offering terms, etc. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional capital as we need to finance our efforts, through asset sales, equity or debt financing, or any combination thereof, on satisfactory terms or at all. Additionally, no assurance can be given that any such financing, if obtained, will be adequate to meet our capital needs and to support our operations. If adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, our revenues and operations and the value of our common stock and common stock equivalents would be materially negatively impacted and we may cease our operations.\nThere is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern\nWe have suffered losses from operations and have insufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, we will need to increase sales volume and obtain additional capital to continue as a going concern and to fund our operations. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may not accomplish, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through offerings of our debt or equity securities, or strategic collaborations. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope, or eliminate one or more of our programs, or substantially curtail or close our operations altogether.\nIf we are unable to renew our GMP certificates and subsequently achieve anticipated production levels, our operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has experienced a substantial decrease in sales volume of all Aoxing Pharmaceutical Products in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was due to Aoxing Pharmaceutical\u2019s temporarily suspension of production to conduct maintenance of its production lines to renew its GMP certificates which is currently anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2017. While our production levels of Shaanxi Weinan products helped to offset the substantial decrease in our sales volume in the most recent fiscal quarter, our sales volume continues to remain at the present decreased levels. However, there is no assurance that the production lines at Aoxing will resume as anticipated and the renewal of GMP certificates will occur when anticipated, or even if they are renewed, we will be able to return to the anticipated production levels. Our inability to regain anticipated production levels may have material adverse effects on our business, operations and financial performance, and may render the Company insolvent.\nOur operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.\nAoxing Pharmaceutical\u2019s operating history may not provide a meaningful basis on which to evaluate its business. We cannot assure you that we will maintain our profitability or that we will not incur net losses in the future. We expect that our operating expenses will increase as we expand. Any significant failure to realize anticipated revenue growth could result in significant operating losses. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies at a similar stage of development, including our potential failure to:\n\u00b7\nraise adequate capital for expansion and operations;\n\u00b7\nimplement our business model and strategy and adapt and modify them as needed;\n\u00b7\nincrease awareness of our brand name, protect our reputation and develop customer loyalty;\n\u00b7\nmanage our expanding operations and service offerings, including the integration of any future acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nmaintain adequate control of our expenses; or\n\u00b7\nanticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the medical over the counter, pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement markets in which we operate as well as the impact of any changes in government regulations, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, technological developments and other significant competitive and market dynamics.\nIf we are not successful in addressing any or all of these risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of Aoxing Pharmaceutical as our operating business would have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nWe have no equity ownership interest in Aoxing Pharmaceutical. Our ability to control Aoxing Pharmaceutical and consolidate its financial results is through a series of contractual arrangements between it and our wholly owned subsidiary Shaanxi Biostar. Management of Aoxing Pharmaceutical is an affiliate of us and of Shaanxi Biostar and the stockholders of Aoxing Pharmaceutical are also our stockholders. Thus, the contractual arrangements were not entered into as a result of arms\u2019 length negotiations because the parties to such agreements are under common control. While we believe that the contractual arrangements are legal and enforceable under PRC law, our affiliates control the parties to the contractual arrangements, and it could be possible for them to cause Aoxing Pharmaceutical and its shareholders to breach the contractual arrangements, in which event our unaffiliated investors would have little or no recourse because of the inherent difficulties in enforcing their rights since all our assets are located in the PRC. In the event that management of Aoxing Pharmaceutical decides to cause a breach the contractual arrangements, the risk of loss for the affiliated shareholders of Aoxing Pharmaceutical could be lower than that for the unaffiliated investors, and the interests of the management and shareholders of Aoxing Pharmaceutical would be in conflict with the interest of our other stockholders.\nOur sales to customers are highly concentrated and the loss of our top customers may significantly adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock.\nOur top customer accounted for 100% of our net sales in fiscal 2016; two of our top ten customers accounted for 65% of our total net sales in fiscal 2015. The loss of our top customers may significantly adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock.\nOur failure to compete effectively may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe compete with other companies, many of whom are developing or can be expected to develop products similar to ours. Many of our competitors are also more established than we are, and have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we presently possess. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and a larger customer base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and customer requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not harm our business.\nWe may require additional financing in the future and a failure to obtain such required financing will inhibit our ability to grow.\nThe continued growth of our business may require additional funding from time to time, which we expect to raise in private placements of our equity or debt securities with accredited investors or by offering our securities for sale pursuant to an effective registration statement on a market where our common stock is traded. The proceeds of these funding will be forwarded to Aoxing Pharmaceutical and accounted for as a loan to Aoxing Pharmaceutical and eliminated during consolidation. The proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes of Aoxing Pharmaceutical, which could include acquisitions, investments, repayment of debt and capital expenditures among other things. We may also use the proceeds to repurchase our capital stock or for our corporate overhead expenses. If we borrow funds we expect to be the primary obligor on any debt. Obtaining additional funding would be subject to a number of factors including market conditions, operating performance and investor sentiment, many of which are outside of our control. These factors could make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional funding unattractive or unavailable to us.\nThe terms of any future financing may adversely affect your interest as stockholders.\nIf we require additional financing in the future, we may be required to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, the terms of which may adversely affect your interests in us. For example, the issuance of additional indebtedness may be senior in right of payment to your shares upon our liquidation. In addition, indebtedness may be under terms that make the operation of Aoxing Pharmaceutical\u2019s business more difficult because the lender\u2019s consent could be required before we take certain actions. Similarly the terms of any equity securities we issue may be senior in right of payment of dividends to your common stock and may contain superior rights and other rights as compared to your common stock. Further, any such issuance of equity securities may dilute your interest in us.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities.\nWe may review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. From time to time we review investment opportunities in new businesses and we expect to make investments in, and to acquire, businesses, products, or technologies in the future. We expect that when we raise funds from investors for any of these purposes we will be either the issuer or the primary obligor while the proceeds will be forwarded to Aoxing Pharmaceutical and accounted for as a loan to Aoxing Pharmaceutical and eliminated during consolidation. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u00b7\nissue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u00b7\nincur substantial debt;\n\u00b7\nassume contingent liabilities; or\n\u00b7\nexpend significant cash.\nThese actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock. Moreover, even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings, there may be a lag between the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits. Acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies and/or products;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with entering markets in which Aoxing Pharmaceutical has no or limited prior experience;\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations; and\n\u00b7\nsubstantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items. purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technology, or personnel that we might acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not have adequate internal accounting controls.\nWe are constantly striving to improve our internal accounting controls. We expect to continue to improve our internal accounting control for budgeting, forecasting, managing and allocating our funds and to better account for them as we grow. There is no guarantee that such improvements will be adequate or successful or that such improvements will be carried out on a timely basis. If we do not have adequate internal accounting controls, we may not be able to appropriately budget, forecast and manage our funds, we may also be unable to prepare accurate accounts on a timely basis to meet our continuing financial reporting obligations and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under US securities laws.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require every public company to include a management report on such company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are new and complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. Some members of our management team have limited or no experience operating a public company, or subject to SEC rules and requirements, including SEC reporting practices and requirements that are applicable to a public company. While we are in the process of engaging a consulting firm to evaluate and assist us with implementing a viable internal control system, our lack of familiarity with Section 404 may nevertheless unduly divert management\u2019s time and resources in executing the business plan. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. So far, our external auditors have not reported to our board of directors any significant weakness on our internal control and provided recommendations accordingly. Nevertheless, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our stock. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing, and pharmaceutical factory operational expertise of key personnel. We are dependent upon the services of Mr. Wang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, for the continued growth and operation of our Company because of his experience in the industry and his personal and business contacts in the PRC. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Wang and do not anticipate entering into an employment agreement in the foreseeable future. Although we have no reason to believe that Mr. Wang will discontinue his services with us or Aoxing Pharmaceutical, the interruption or loss of his services would adversely affect our ability to effectively run our business and pursue our business strategy as well as our results of operations. Additionally, Xiaojuan Zhai, our Chief Financial Officer, Zhenghong Wang, our Chief Operating Officer, Yuan Jian, General Manager and Chief Engineer of Aoxing Pharmaceutical, perform key functions in the operation of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these officers after the term of their employment contracts expire. The loss of these officers could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We do not carry key man life insurance for any of our key personnel nor do we foresee purchasing such insurance to protect against a loss of key personnel.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to support our growth and if we are unable to retain or hire these personnel in the future, our ability to improve our products and implement our business objectives could be adversely affected.\nWe must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees. Competition for senior management and senior personnel in the PRC is intense, the pool of qualified candidates in the PRC is very limited, and we may not be able to retain the services of our senior executives or senior personnel, or attract and retain high-quality senior executives or senior personnel in the future. This failure could materially and adversely affect our future growth and financial condition.\nIf we fail to increase our brand recognition, we may face difficulty in obtaining new customers and business partners.\nWe believe that establishing, maintaining and enhancing our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our current and future products and services and is an important element in our effort to increase our customer base and obtain new business partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. Some of our potential competitors already have well-established brands in the pharmaceutical promotion and distribution industry. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on our ability to maintain a sizeable and active customer base, our marketing efforts and ability to provide reliable and useful products and services at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we will incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, in which case our business, operating results and financial condition, would be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe costs of pharmaceutical products and development;\n\u00b7\nthe relative speed and success with which we can obtain and maintain customers, merchants and vendors for our products;\n\u00b7\ncapital expenditure for equipment;\n\u00b7\nmarketing and promotional activities and other costs;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies, suppliers and competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our suppliers to provide products in a timely manner to their customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in operating expenses;\n\u00b7\nincreased competition in the pharmaceutical markets; and\n\u00b7\nother general economic and seasonal factors.\nOur future sales and operations may be adversely affected by recent PRC reports that gel capsules supplied by certain manufacturers contained impermissible levels of chromium.\nIn April 2012, the PRC news agencies reported that the SFDA suspended sales and distributions of 13 drugs from 9 pharmaceutical companies that used capsules supplied by certain gel capsule manufacturers in Zhejiang and Hebei Provinces, PRC. According to the SFDA investigation and testing of capsule samples, 23 out of 42 samples were found to contain excessive levels of chromium, a toxic heavy metal. As further reported in the PRC mass media, the regulatory inquiry into this matter is ongoing. In addition to drug sale suspensions, SFDA also revoked production licenses of two gel capsule manufacturers and was pursuing other regulatory and criminal prosecution measures. As of April 27, 2012, SFDA promulgated a set of regulations requiring pharmaceutical companies to self-inspect and self-screen to ensure no toxic products in their inventory, including, without limitation, employing toxic substance detection devices.\nIn May 2012, following an onsite inspection by the Xianyang State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), samples from a batch of the Company\u2019s Xin Aoxing capsules were found to contain chromium content higher than edible gelatin. Specifically, samples from a batch of 150 cases of the Xin Aoxing capsules (each of the 150 cases contains 8,000 capsules), representing Biostar sales of approximately RMB1,188,000 or approximately $188,000 were found to contain high levels of chromium, which capsules, in the Company\u2019s estimation, were sold in the market in mid-2011. The Company did not check the batch in question for the chromium levels at that time since PRC pharmaceutical companies were not required to test their gel capsule inventories and purchases for chromium levels in 2011.\nAs required by SFDA in April 2012, the Company purchased gel capsule inspection equipment to measure the chromium levels in gel capsules it used. The Company also undertook a thorough inspection of all samples of drugs sold and its current product inventory to ensure that all of the gel capsules it had purchased and currently uses comply with the SFDA chromium content requirements. In addition, the Company conducted checks of every batch of raw materials it uses in every production category and, except as discussed above, found no violations of the chromium content requirements. Further, the Company recalled all such affected capsules as promptly and thoroughly as possible, and imposed heightened quality control and assurance measures going forward. On July 30, 2012, the SFDA approved the Company\u2019s resumption of sales of its gel capsules following the thorough inspection. However, the suspension of sales of gel capsule products severely affected almost all China-based pharmaceutical companies that use gelatin capsules to manufacture their drugs. The Company was not immune to the industry-wide losses and the Company\u2019s sales and overall results for the 2012 second quarter were similarly adversely affected. The Company has been taking a number of steps to restart sales of gel capsule drugs immediately following the SFDA approval, including, among others, engaging its employees to work overtime, adding a second shift, launching an aggressive advertising campaign to help improve consumer confidence, establishing incentives for the sales force in all of the distribution offices nationwide, and launching an innovating B2C call center to take order and provide hands-on sales support. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in detecting such defective gel capsules in the future. In any such event, the Company may be required to find alternate gel capsule supplier and its operations and sales efforts in the short-term may therefore be adversely affected.\nWe face marketing risks.\nNewly developed drugs and technology may not be compatible with market needs. Because markets for drugs differentiate geographically inside the PRC, we must develop and manufacture our products to accurately target specific markets to ensure product sales. If we fail to invest in extensive market research to understand the health needs of consumers in different geographic areas, we may face limited market acceptance of our products, which could have material adverse effect on our sales and earnings.\nWe face risks relating to difficulty in defending intellectual property rights from infringement.\nOur success depends on protection of our current and future technology and products and our ability to defend our intellectual property rights. We have filed for trademark protection for the various names and brands of our products sold in the PRC. We have also filed for patent protection on three of our products, one of which has been approved. However, it is possible for its competitors to develop similar competitive products even though it has taken steps to protect its intellectual property. If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours. We expect to file patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technology and products in various countries, including the PRC. Some patent applications in the PRC are maintained in secrecy until the patent is issued. Because the publication of discoveries tends to follow their actual discovery by many months, we may not be the first to invent, or file patent applications on any of our discoveries. Patents may not be issued with respect to any of our patent applications and existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us may not provide competitive advantages for our products. Patents that are issued may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. Furthermore, our patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, non-patented proprietary expertise and continuing technological innovation that we shall seek to protect, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of a breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Moreover, our trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. If patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to these products.\nWe face risks relating to third parties that may claim that we infringe on their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling certain of our products.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry with respect to the manufacturing, use and sale of new products. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may be required to commence or defend against charges relating to the infringement of patent or proprietary rights. Any such litigation could:\n\u00b7\nrequire us to incur substantial expense, even if covered by insurance or are successful in the litigation;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to divert significant time and effort of our technical and management personnel;\n\u00b7\nresult in the loss of our rights to develop or make certain products; and\n\u00b7\nrequire us to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties in order to license proprietary rights from third parties.\nAlthough patent and intellectual property disputes within the pharmaceutical industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include the long-term payment of royalties. These arrangements may be investigated by regulatory agencies and, if improper, may be invalidated. Furthermore, the required licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or increase our costs to market these products. In addition, when seeking regulatory approval for some of our products, we may be required to certify to regulatory authorities, including the SFDA that such products do not infringe upon third party patent rights. Filing a certification against a patent gives the patent holder the right to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against us. Any lawsuit would delay the receipt of regulatory approvals. A claim of infringement and the resulting delay could result in substantial expenses and even prevent us from manufacturing and selling certain of our products. Our launch of a product prior to a final court decision or the expiration of a patent held by a third party may result in substantial damages to us. If we are found to infringe a patent held by a third party and become subject to such damages, these damages could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to research and the ability to develop new drugs.\nOur growth and survival depends on our ability to consistently discover, develop and commercialize new products and find new and improve on existing technology and platforms. As such, if we fail to make sufficient investments in research, be attentive to consumer needs or does not focus on the most advanced technology, our current and future products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products of other companies.\nRisk Related To the Pharmaceutical Industry\nOur certificates, permits, and licenses related to our pharmaceutical operations are subject to governmental control and renewal and failure to obtain renewal will cause all or part of our operations to be terminated.\nAoxing Pharmaceutical is subject to various PRC laws and regulations pertaining to the pharmaceutical industry. Aoxing Pharmaceutical has attained certificates, permits, and licenses required for the operation of a pharmaceutical enterprise and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in the PRC. In 1998, the State Food and Drug Administration of the PRC (\u201cSFDA\u201d) introduced the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Certificate in order to promote quality and safety of pharmaceutical production. The Good Manufacturing Practices were revised in July and October 2004. We and our competitors are required to meet GMP standards in order to continue manufacturing pharmaceutical products and health foods. For each new product, Aoxing Pharmaceutical prepares documentation of pharmacological, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism studies in addition to providing samples of the drug. The documentation and samples are then submitted to provincial food and drug administration. This process typically takes approximately three months. After the documentation and samples have been approved by the provincial food and drug administration, the provincial administration submits the approved documentation and samples to the SFDA. The SFDA examines the documentation and tests the samples and presents the findings to the New Drug Examination Committee for approval. If the application is approved by the SFDA, the SFDA will issue a clinical trial license to the applicant for clinical trials. This clinical trial license approval typically takes one year, followed by approximately two years of trials, depending on the category and class of the new drug. The SFDA then examines the documentation from the trial and, if approved, issues the new drug license to the applicant. This process usually takes eight months. The entire process takes anywhere from three to four years.\nAoxing Pharmaceutical initially obtained pharmaceutical products and health food production permits by submitting its manufacturing processes and product tests to the SFDA who verified that its production processes and products met the standards by onsite inspections, review of test results and a determination that the market was not saturated by its products. The production permits are permanent once issued as long as they are renewed by the expiration date. The GMP certificate is valid for a term of five years, the pharmaceutical products production permits are subject to renewal every five years, and the health food production permits are valid for three year terms, and each must be renewed before its expiration, if applicable. Aoxing Pharmaceutical originally obtained its GMP certificate in January 2006, and it is valid until January 23, 2011. The GMP certificate applies to products described as medicinal tablets, granules, capsules, soft capsules, powder, and ointment. If the GMP certificate expires without renewal, Aoxing Pharmaceutical will not be able to continue production of pharmaceutical products, which will cause its operations to terminate. We filed the application to renew the GMP certificate before its expiration date, and SFDA has approved our application and issued its official GMP license on March 29, 2011. It is a common practice in China to have the grace period between the GMP expiry day and new GMP license day. We intend to apply for renewal of these health food production permits prior to expiration. During the renewal process, Aoxing Pharmaceutical will be re-evaluated by the appropriate governmental authorities and must comply with the then prevailing standards and regulations which may change from time to time. In the event that it is not able to renew the certificates, permits and licenses, all or part of its operations may be terminated. Furthermore, if escalating compliance costs associated with governmental standards and regulations restrict or prohibit any part of its operations, it may adversely affect its operation and our profitability.\nAccording to Drug Administration Law of the PRC and its implementing rules, the SFDA approvals, including Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit and Drug Approval Numbers, may be suspended or revoked prior to the expiration date under circumstances that include:\n\u00b7\nproducing counterfeit medicine;\n\u00b7\nproducing inferior quality products;\n\u00b7\nfailing to meet the drug GMP standards;\n\u00b7\npurchasing medical ingredients used in the production of products sources that do not have Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit or Pharmaceutical Trade Permit;\n\u00b7\nfraudulent reporting of results or product samples in application process;\n\u00b7\nfailing to meet drug labeling and direction standards;\n\u00b7\nbribing doctors or hospital personnel to entice them to use products,\n\u00b7\nproducing pharmaceuticals for use or resale by companies that are not approved by the SFDA, or\n\u00b7\nthe approved drug has a serious side effect.\nIf our pharmaceutical products fail to receive regulatory approval or are severely limited in these products\u2019 scope of use, we may be unable to recoup considerable research and development expenditures.\nOur research and development of pharmaceutical products is subject to the regulatory approval of the SFDA. The regulatory approval procedure for pharmaceuticals can be quite lengthy, costly, and uncertain. Depending upon the discretion of the SFDA, the approval process may be significantly delayed by additional clinical testing and require the expenditure of resources not currently available; in such an event, it may be necessary for us to abandon our application. Even where approval of the product is granted, it may contain significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings, precautions, or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use. If approval of our product is denied, abandoned, or severely limited in terms of the scope of products use, it may result in the inability to recoup considerable research and development expenditures. Currently, three of our products, Zushima, Gan Fu Kang and Azithromycin Dispersible Tablets, have pending applications with the SFDA. Phase III clinical testing is occurring for five other products (Shenrong Capsules, Zhixuening Pian, Xiao\u2019aiping Dispersible Tablets, Zhenbao Wan Capsules, and KunLing Wan Capsules), which expects to be completed sometime in 2015 to 2018. After phase III clinical test, these products will be submitted for SFDA approval. If we do not receive timely approval for any of these drugs, then production will be delayed and sales of the products may be adversely affected.\nPrice control regulations may decrease our profitability.\nThe laws of the PRC provide for the government to fix and adjust prices. The prices of certain medicines we distribute, including those listed in the Chinese government\u2019s catalogue of medications that are reimbursable under the PRC\u2019s social insurance program, or the Insurance Catalogue, are subject to control by the relevant state or provincial price administration authorities. The PRC establishes price levels for products based on market conditions, average industry cost, supply and demand and social responsibility. In practice, price control with respect to these medicines sets a ceiling on their retail price. The actual price of such medicines set by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers cannot historically exceed the price ceiling imposed by applicable government price control regulations. Although, as a general matter, government price control regulations have resulted in drug prices tending to decline over time, there has been no predictable pattern for such decreases. It is possible that additional products may be subject to price control, or that price controls may be increased in the future. To the extent that our products are subject to price control, our revenue, gross profit, gross margin and net income will be affected since the revenue we derive from our sales will be limited and we may face no limitation on our costs. Further, if price controls affect both our revenue and costs, our ability to be profitable and the extent of our profitability will be effectively subject to determination by the applicable regulatory authorities in the PRC.\nIf the medications we produce are replaced by other medicines or are removed from the PRC\u2019s insurance catalogue in the future, our revenue may suffer.\nUnder Chinese regulations, patients purchasing medicine listed by the central and/or provincial governments in the insurance catalogue may be reimbursed, in part or in whole, by a social medicine fund. Accordingly, pharmaceutical distributors prefer to engage in the distribution of medicine listed in the insurance catalogue. Currently, one of our main prescription products, Danshen Granule is listed in the insurance catalogue. The content of the insurance catalogue is subject to change by the PRC Ministry of Labor and Social Security, and new medicine may be added to the insurance catalogue by provincial level authorities as part of their limited ability to change certain medicines listed in the insurance catalogue. If the medicine we produce are replaced by other medicines or removed from the insurance catalogue in the future, our revenue may suffer.\nAdverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nThe results of our operations may be significantly affected by the public\u2019s perception of our product and similar companies. This perception is dependent upon opinions concerning:\n\u00b7\nthe safety and quality of our products and ingredients;\n\u00b7\nthe safety and quality of similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies; and\n\u00b7\nour sales force.\nAdverse publicity concerning any actual or purported failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding product claims and advertising, good manufacturing practices, or other aspects of our business, whether or not resulting in enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties, could have an adverse effect on our goodwill and could negatively affect our sales and ability to generate revenue. In addition, our consumers\u2019 perception of the safety and quality of products and ingredients as well as similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies can be significantly influenced by media attention, publicized scientific research or findings, widespread product liability claims and other publicity concerning our products or ingredients or similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies. Adverse publicity, whether or not accurate or resulting from consumers\u2019 use or misuse of our products, that associates consumption of our products or ingredients or any similar products or ingredients with illness or other adverse effects, questions the benefits of our or similar products or claims that any such products are ineffective, inappropriately labeled or have inaccurate instructions as to their use, could negatively impact our reputation or the market demand for our products.\nIf we fail to develop new products with high profit margins, and our high profit margin products are substituted by competitor\u2019s products, our gross and net profit margins will be adversely affected.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to sustain our profit margins in the future. The pharmaceutical industry in the PRC is very competitive, and there may be pressure to reduce sale prices of products without a corresponding decrease in the price of raw materials. In addition, new products are constantly being introduced to the market. In order to increase our sales and expand our market share, we may be forced to reduce prices in the future, leading to a decrease in gross profit margin. The research and development of new products and technology is costly and time consuming, and there are no assurances that our research and development of new products will either be successful or completed within the anticipated timeframe, if ever at all. There is no assurance that our competitors\u2019 new products, technology, and processes will not render our existing products obsolete or non-competitive. To the extent that we fail to develop new products with high profit margins and our high profit margin products are substituted by competitors\u2019 products, our gross profit margins will be adversely affected.\nThe commercial success of our products depends upon the degree of market acceptance among the medical community and failure to attain market acceptance among the medical community may have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability.\nThe commercial success of our products depends upon the degree of market acceptance by the PRC medical community, such as hospitals and physicians. Even if our products are approved by the SFDA, there is no assurance that physicians will prescribe or recommend our products to patients. Furthermore, a product\u2019s prevalence and use at hospitals may be contingent upon its relationship with the medical community. Currently, Danshen Granule and Taohausan are only available by medical prescription. The acceptance of our products by the PRC medical community may depend upon several factors, including but not limited to, the product\u2019s acceptance by physicians and patients as a safe and effective treatment, cost effectiveness, potential advantages over alternative treatments, and the prevalence and severity of side effects. Failure to attain market acceptance among the medical community may have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in the PRC\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nOur business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The PRC has operated as a socialist state since the mid-1900s and is controlled by the PRC\u2019s Communist Party. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we and it must conduct our business activities. The PRC has only permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities since 1988. The government of the PRC has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy, particularly the pharmaceutical industry, through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in the PRC may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Under current leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of the PRC will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice. The PRC\u2019s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions of the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, there is no assurance that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social life.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such PRC laws and regulations may harm its business.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. The PRC\u2019s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, in which system decided legal cases have little value as precedents unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy and criminal proceedings. The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We are considered a foreign person or foreign funded enterprise under PRC laws, and as a result, we are required to comply with PRC laws and regulations. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on its businesses. If the relevant authorities find that we are in violation of PRC laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nlevying fines;\n\u00b7\nrevoking Aoxing Pharmaceutical\u2019s business and other licenses;\n\u00b7\nrequiring that we restructure our ownership or operations; and\n\u00b7\nrequiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business.\nAmong the material laws of the PRC that we are subject to are (i) the Medicine Management Law, governing the management of pharmaceutical companies, medicine production procedure and packaging, prices, (ii) the Advertisement Law , the Rules of Medicine Advertisements Management implemented by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the Regulations on Control of Advertisements from the State Council, governing rules on advertising, (iii) the Standardization of the Management on the Quality of Medicine Production issued by the SFDA, providing standards for staff, plants, equipment, materials, environment and production management, (iv) the Price Law, (v) the Measurement Law, (vi) the Tax Law, (vii) the Environmental Protection Law, (viii) the Contract Law, (ix) the Patent Law, (x) the Accounting Laws and (xi) the Labor Law.\nA slowdown, inflation or other adverse developments in the PRC economy may harm our customers and the demand for our services and products.\nAll of our operations are conducted in the PRC and all of our revenue is generated from sales in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in recent years, we cannot assure you that this growth will continue. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC could significantly reduce the demand for our products and harm our business. While the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth could lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may harm our profitability. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credit, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. Such an austere policy can lead to a slowing of economic growth. Repeated rises in interest rates by the central bank would likely slow economic activity in the PRC which could, in turn, materially increase its costs and also reduce demand for its products.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Chinese currency, the Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d), into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. We receive substantially all of our revenue in RMB, which is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends, or otherwise satisfy foreign currency dominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate governmental authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also in the future restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due.\nThe fluctuation of the Renminbi may harm your investment.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. According to the website www.oanda.com, as of April 3, 2017, US$1 was equal to RMB 6.88825. As we rely entirely on revenue earned in the PRC, any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into RMB for Aoxing Pharmaceutical\u2019s operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would diminish the value of the proceeds of the offering and this could harm Aoxing Pharmaceutical\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations because it would reduce the proceeds available to us for capital investment in proportion to the appreciation of the RMB. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common shares or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB; the U.S. dollar equivalent of the RMB we convert would be reduced in proportion to the amount the U.S. dollar appreciates. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.\nSubstantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable and final content of draft PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.\nThe Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015 (the \u201cDraft FIL\u201d) aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Draft FIL embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. The Ministry of Commerce is currently soliciting comments on this draft and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment timetable, final content, interpretation and implementation.\nAmong other things, the Draft FIL expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of \u201cactual control\u201d in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The Draft FIL specifically provides that entities established in China but \u201ccontrolled\u201d by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that the entity is \u201ccontrolled\u201d by PRC entities and/or citizens. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a \u201cnegative list,\u201d to be separately issued by the State Council later. Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance, prior approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required for establishment of the FIE. Under the Draft FIL, VIEs that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately \u201ccontrolled\u201d by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in an industry category that is on the \u201cnegative list\u201d the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate only if the ultimate controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling person(s) is/are of foreign nationalities, the VIEs will be treated as FIEs and any operation in the industry category on the \u201cnegative list\u201d without market entry clearance may be considered as illegal.\nThe provision of services, which we conduct through our VIEs, is currently subject to foreign investment restrictions set forth in the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce that was amended in 2011 and became effective in January 2012. The Draft FIL, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations in many aspects.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC (\u201cSAFE\u201d) regulations regarding offshore financing activities by PRC residents which may increase the administrative burden we face. The failure by our shareholders who are PRC residents to make any required applications and filings pursuant to such regulations may prevent us from being able to distribute profits and could expose us and our PRC resident shareholders to liability under PRC law.\nIn October 2005, SAFE issued a public notice effective from November 1, 2005, the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, or the SAFE notice or SAFE #75, which requires PRC residents, including both legal persons and natural persons, to register with the competent local SAFE branch before establishing or controlling any company outside of the PRC, referred to as an \u201coffshore special purpose company,\u201d for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving onshore assets or equity interests held by them. In addition, any PRC resident that is the shareholder of an offshore special purpose company is required to amend its SAFE registration with the local SAFE branch with respect to that offshore special purpose company in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in the PRC. Moreover, if the offshore special purpose company was established and owned the onshore assets or equity interests before the implementation date of the SAFE notice, a retroactive SAFE registration is required to have been completed before March 31, 2006. If any PRC shareholder of any offshore special purpose company fails to make the required SAFE registration and amendment, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore special purpose company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore special purpose company. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nCertain of our shareholders who may be subject to the foregoing registration requirement (including certain members of our management) have submitted their registration applications to the relevant SAFE authority as well as notified the local authority where we are domiciled of such applications. We have been advised by such SAFE authority, however, that it is unable to issue SAFE registration due to current internal policy, but may issue a confirmation acknowledging receipt of our applications in lieu thereof, and issue the SAFE registration at a later time when internal policy changes. There is no assurance, however, that we will receive such confirmation or that such confirmation, when issued, would be sufficient for compliance purpose with the SAFE notice. Additionally, we do not know when the internal policy of the relevant SAFE authority will change, if at all, and there is no assurance that when such policy changes, we will be issued SAFE registration. As such, we or our PRC resident shareholders may nevertheless be deemed in violation of SAFE #75 despite our attempt at compliance. In the event that we or our PRC resident shareholders are deemed to be in violation of SAFE #75 despite our attempt at compliance, Shaanxi Biostar could lose the ability to remit monies outside of the PRC and would therefore be unable to pay dividends or make other distributions. Our PRC resident shareholders could be subject to fines, other sanctions and even criminal liabilities under the PRC Foreign Exchange Administrative Regulations promulgated January 29, 1996, as amended.\nThe PRC\u2019s legal and judicial system may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights of foreign investors.\nThe PRC legal and judicial system may negatively impact foreign investors. In 1982, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Constitution of the PRC to authorize foreign investment and guarantee the \u201clawful rights and interests\u201d of foreign investors in the PRC. However, the PRC\u2019s system of laws is not yet comprehensive. The legal and judicial systems in the PRC are still rudimentary, and enforcement of existing laws is inconsistent. Many judges in the PRC lack the depth of legal training and experience that would be expected of a judge in a more developed country. Because the PRC judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing the laws that do exist, anticipation of judicial decision-making is more uncertain than would be expected in a more developed country. It may be impossible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist, or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. The PRC\u2019s legal system is based on the civil law regime, that is, it is based on written statutes; a decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to be followed by judges in other cases. In addition, the interpretation of Chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes. The promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws and the pre-emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. However, the trend of legislation over the last 20 years has significantly enhanced the protection of foreign investment and allowed for more control by foreign parties of their investments in Chinese enterprises. There can be no assurance that a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic or social life, will not affect the PRC government\u2019s ability to continue to support and pursue these reforms. Such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe practical effect of the PRC legal system on our business operations in the PRC can be viewed from two separate but intertwined considerations. First, as a matter of substantive law, the Foreign Invested Enterprise laws provide significant protection from government interference. In addition, these laws guarantee the full enjoyment of the benefits of corporate Articles and contracts to Foreign Invested Enterprise participants. These laws, however, do impose standards concerning corporate formation and governance, which are qualitatively different from the general corporation laws of the United States. Similarly, the PRC accounting laws mandate accounting practices, which are not consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. PRC\u2019s accounting laws require that an annual \u201cstatutory audit\u201d be performed in accordance with PRC accounting standards and that the books of account of Foreign Invested Enterprises are maintained in accordance with Chinese accounting laws. Article 14 of the People\u2019s Republic of China Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law requires a wholly foreign-owned enterprise to submit certain periodic fiscal reports and statements to designated financial and tax authorities, at the risk of business license revocation. While the enforcement of substantive rights may appear less clear than United States procedures, the Foreign Invested Enterprises and Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises are Chinese registered companies, which enjoy the same status as other Chinese registered companies in business-to-business dispute resolution. Any award rendered by an arbitration tribunal is enforceable in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). Therefore, as a practical matter, although no assurances can be given, the Chinese legal infrastructure, while different in operation from its United States counterpart, should not present any significant impediment to the operation of Foreign Invested Enterprises.\nAs found in \u201cItem 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d, the Company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ronghua Wang owed personal debts to certain creditors. Under the PRC legal system, since Mr. Ronghua Wang is a major shareholder of the Company, the Courts froze certain assets of the Company in order to prevent those assets from being transferred. While the Company was not a party to the lending arrangement with the creditor, it was involved in the legal disputes as result of its association with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. These are legal risks related to conducting business in the PRC that are not likely to exist for companies doing business in the United States. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s assets will not be subject to future disputes as a result of its association to Mr. Ronghua Wang.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners to personal liability and limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC entities, limit our PRC entities\u2019 ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially and adversely affect us.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d), issued the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Round-trip Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles (\u201cSAFE Circular No. 75\u201d), and a series of implementation rules and guidance, requiring PRC residents, including both legal persons and natural persons, to register with the relevant local branch of SAFE before establishing or acquiring control over any company outside of China, referred to as an offshore special purpose company, for the purpose of raising funds from overseas to acquire assets of, or equity interest in, PRC companies. In addition, any PRC resident that is a beneficial owner of an offshore special purpose company is required to amend his or her registration with the local branch of SAFE, with respect to that offshore special purpose company in connection with any increase or decrease in its capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China. Any failure to comply with the above registration requirements could result in our PRC entities being prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to their offshore parent companies, offshore parent companies being restricted in their ability to contribute additional capital into their PRC entities and may also subject the relevant PRC entities and PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. Any failure or inability by individuals to comply with SAFE regulations may subject us to fines or legal sanctions, such as restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or our direct PRC entities\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain foreign-exchange-denominated loans from, our company or prevent us from making distributions or paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission may be required in connection with the global offering, and, if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d), promulgated the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (\u201cM&A Rules\u201d), which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June 22, 2009. This regulation, among other things, requires offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, formed for the purpose of an overseas listing and controlled by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain CSRC approval prior to listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. The application of this regulation remains unclear. Our PRC counsel has advised us that, based on their understanding if the current PRC law, rules, and regulations:\n\u00b7\nwe established our PRC entities by means of direct investment other than by merger and acquisition of any equity interest or assets of a PRC domestic company owned by PRC companies and/or PRC individuals as defined under the M&A Rules that are our beneficial owners after the effective date of the M&A Rules;\n\u00b7\nthe CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like ours under this Prospectus Supplement are subject to this regulation;\n\u00b7\ngiven that no provision in this regulation clearly classified contractual arrangements as a type of transaction subject to its regulation, we are not required to submit an application to the CSRC for its approval.\nBecause there has been no official interpretation or clarification of M&A Rules since its adoption, there is uncertainty as to how this regulation will be interpreted or implemented. If it is determined that the CSRC approval is required for the offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies for failure to seek the CSRC approval for the offering. These sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, delays or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from the offering into the PRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC entities, or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospectus, as well as the trading price of the common stock.\nAny recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, or another widespread public health problem, could harm our operations.\nA renewed outbreak of SARS or another widespread public health problem (such as bird flu) in the PRC, where all of our revenue is derived, could significantly harm our operations. Our operations may be impacted by a number of health-related factors, including quarantines or closures of some of our offices that would adversely disrupt our operations. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could significantly harm our operations.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States and most of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights based on U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers or to enforce U.S. court judgments against us or them in the PRC.\nMost of our directors and all of our officers reside in China. In addition, our operating company is located in the PRC and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws against us in the courts of either the U.S. or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in U.S. courts, to enforce such judgments in PRC courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties, under the U.S. Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nThe relative lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur management team lacks public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The individuals who now constitute our senior management have never had responsibility for managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. Our failure to comply with all applicable requirements could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and distract our management from attending to the growth of our business.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.\nIf we are unable to meet the Nasdaq Stock Market continued listing requirements, our securities may be subject to delisting.\nFollowing the October 2013 transfer, our securities are listed and are trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cBSPM\u201d. The Nasdaq Capital Market is a continuous trading market that operates in substantially the same manner as The Nasdaq Global Market. If we cannot demonstrate compliance with the continued listing requirements, our common stock may then be subject to delisting.\nOn February 21, 2017, Biostar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) received a notification letter from Nasdaq Listing Qualifications (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) advising the Company that, following Zhongyang Shang\u2019s resignation as an independent director of the Company, the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5605 pertaining to the independent director membership of the Company\u2019s Board and its Audit and Compensation Committees. Pursuant to Listing Rules 5605(b)(1)(A), 5605(c)(4) and 5605(d)(4), the Company is extended a cure period to regain compliance with the foregoing deficiency as follows:\n\u00b7\nUntil the earlier of the Company\u2019s next annual shareholders\u2019 meeting or February 5, 2018, or\n\u00b7\nIf the next annual shareholders\u2019 meeting is held before August 4, 2017, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than August 4, 2017 (together, the \u201cCompliance Deadline\u201d).\nIf the Company does not regain compliance by the Compliance Deadline, the Company\u2019s securities will be subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. In its February 9, 2017 Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company disclosed Mr. Shang\u2019s departure as a Board and Board committee member due to severe personal health issues. The Company is currently going through the process of considering suitable candidates to fill the vacancy resulting from Mr. Shang\u2019s departure. The Company intends to complete this process in due course and by the Compliance Deadline so as to regain the Company\u2019s compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements.\nOur common shares have historically been thinly traded, and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you desire to liquidate your shares.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Our common stock commenced trading on The Nasdaq Global Market on April 23, 2010 and is currently trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Our common stock was previously quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, where they have historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly traded\u201d, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained. The market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company with a small and thinly traded \u201cfloat\u201d that could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. The price at which you purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nThe market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our common shares are sporadically and/or thinly traded. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price. Secondly, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our fluctuating level of revenues or profits to date and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our current and potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-averse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. The following factors may add to the volatility in the price of our common shares: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; adverse outcomes; the termination of our contractual arrangements with Aoxing Pharmaceutical; and additions or departures of our key personnel, as well as other items discussed under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as elsewhere in this report. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common shares will sustain their current market prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.\nStockholders should be aware that the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.\nTechniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has, supposedly, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometime known as \u201cdisclosed shorts\u201d) publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. While traditionally these disclosed shorts were limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog (\u201cblogging\u201d) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company\u2019s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called research reports that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base. Issuers with business operations based in the PRC and who have limited trading volumes and are susceptible to higher volatility levels than U.S. domestic large-cap stocks, can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks. These short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Regulation AC (Regulation Analyst Certification) and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed shorts will continue to issue such reports.\nWhile we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attacks, often times we are constrained, either by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law (often called \u201cAnti-SLAPP statutes\u201d), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller. You should be aware that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy - oftentimes blogging from outside the U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements - should we be targeted for such an attack, our stock will likely suffer from a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in market price should the rumors created not be dismissed by market participants.\nVolatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 93344, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "BSPM"}
