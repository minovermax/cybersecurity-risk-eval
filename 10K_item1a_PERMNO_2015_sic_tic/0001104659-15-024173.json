{"cik": "1600132", "company": "Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was approximately $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We do not know whether or when we will become profitable. We have not generated any revenues to date from product sales. We have not completed development of any product candidate and have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our deficit and working capital. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u00b7 continue our research and clinical development of our INOpulse program for the treatment of PAH and PH-COPD and of our BCM program for the prevention of left ventricular remodeling following a STEMI;\n\u00b7 identify, develop and/or in-license additional product candidates;\n\u00b7 seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u00b7 in the future, establish a manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development;\n\u00b7 hire additional clinical, regulatory, quality control and scientific personnel; and\n\u00b7 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and any future commercialization efforts and personnel and infrastructure necessary to help us comply with our obligations as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. We do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we are able to obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering additional product candidates,\nobtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. We are in the early stages of most of these activities and have not yet commenced other of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by the FDA or the EMA to perform trials in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in us.\nIn addition, our recurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit and our need to raise additional financing in order to continue to fund our operations, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Given our planned expenditures for the next several years, including, without limitation, expenditures in connection with our clinical trials, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur very limited operating history as a stand-alone company may make it difficult for our stockholders to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ikaria in October 2013 and became a stand-alone company in February 2014 following the Spin-Out and, as such, have a very limited operating history as a stand-alone company. Prior to the Spin-Out, Ikaria assisted us by providing financing and certain corporate functions. Following the Spin-Out, Ikaria has no obligation to provide assistance to us other than on an interim basis as provided for in the agreements we entered into in connection with the Spin-Out. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions-Relationship with Ikaria.\u201d\nOur operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing and securing our technology, and undertaking pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated the ability to successfully operate as a stand-alone company or to complete development of any product candidates, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions our stockholders make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing products.\nAssuming we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities or we will need to enter into strategic partnerships. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and may not be successful in such a transition.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we initiate additional clinical trials of our INOpulse and BCM product candidates and continue research and development and seek regulatory approval for these and potentially other product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In particular, the costs that may be required for the manufacture of any product candidate that receives marketing approval may be substantial. In addition, relative to previous years when we operated as a private company, we expect to incur additional costs in 2015 and future years associated with operating as a public company. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $27.6 million. From the inception of our business through December 31, 2014, Ikaria made cumulative investments of $177.5 million in us and contributed an additional $80.0 million in cash to us in connection with the Spin-Out. Now that we are a stand-alone company, any additional funding will need to come from another source. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe plan to use our current cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, including the net proceeds of our initial public offering, primarily to fund our ongoing research and development efforts. We will be required to expend significant funds in order to advance development of our INOpulse and BCM product candidates and any other potential product candidates. Our existing cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, including the net proceeds of our initial public offering, will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake, such as the further development of INOpulse for PH-COPD or BCM, or to fund completion of clinical development or commercialization of any of our product candidates. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations or licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2014, together with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least into mid-2016. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the progress and results of our current and planned clinical trials of our INOpulse and BCM product candidates;\n\u00b7 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the costs of operating as a stand-alone company;\n\u00b7 the cost and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, pre-clinical development and clinical trials for any other product candidates;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n\u00b7 our headcount growth and associated costs; and\n\u00b7 the costs of operating as a public company.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings and/or license and development agreements with collaboration partners. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as a stand-alone company, and we may experience increased or unexpected costs after the Spin-Out or as a result of the Spin-Out.\nWe have historically operated as part of Ikaria\u2019s broader corporate organization, and Ikaria has assisted us by providing certain corporate functions. However, following the Spin-Out, Ikaria is contractually obligated to provide to us only those services specified in a transition services agreement, or the TSA, a services agreement, or the 2015 Services Agreement, and the other agreements we entered into with Ikaria to govern our relationship following the Spin-Out. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions-Relationship with Ikaria\u201d for a summary of these agreements. The TSA and the 2015 Services Agreement provide for certain\nservices to be provided until February 2016. We may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms the services or other benefits that Ikaria previously provided to us that are not specified in the TSA, the 2015 Services Agreement or the other agreements. Also, upon the termination of the services provided under the TSA or other agreements, such services will be provided internally or by unaffiliated third parties, and we expect that in some instances, we will incur higher costs to obtain such services than we incurred under the terms of such agreements. Ultimately, we may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms the services specified in such agreements. In addition, during the transitional services period, we will rely, in part, on the same executive team at Ikaria that also will continue to manage the business of Ikaria during such time, and there may be conflicting demands on their time, which could result in an inadequate level of attention to the demands of our business. If Ikaria and its employees do not continue to perform effectively the transition services and the other services that are called for under the TSA, the 2015 Services Agreement and other agreements, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOn March 5, 2015, Mallinckrodt and Ikaria announced that the two companies had entered into a definitive agreement under which a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt will acquire Ikaria and that they expect the acquisition will be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2015. While the TSA imposes binding obligations on Ikaria to perform in accordance with the TSA\u2019s terms, it is possible that following completion of the sale, as the new owner\u2019s influence on Ikaria\u2019s operations increases, Ikaria may not continue to provide the same level of performance under the TSA as Ikaria has provided to date. Moreover, to the extent that we desire to extend, renew or expand the scope of the TSA, it is also possible that Ikaria will not be willing to do so on reasonable terms, or at all. In any of these circumstances, our business, product development and financial statements could be materially adversely affected.\nPrior to the Spin-Out, we utilized the executive management team and administrative resources of Ikaria. Many daily functions were performed by Ikaria, including those related to the preparation of our financial statements and the engagement of auditors to audit our financial statements, which have become our responsibility following the Spin-Out. We may need to acquire assets and resources in addition to those provided to us by Ikaria, and we may face difficulty in integrating newly acquired assets into our business. Additionally, as a stand-alone company, we no longer have access to Ikaria\u2019s financial resources. Instead, our ability to fund our capital needs will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, enter into partnering arrangements, obtain debt financing and access capital markets, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed, possibly materially, if we have difficulty operating as a stand-alone company, fail to acquire necessary capital or assets that prove to be important to our operations, or are unable to enter into partnering or other business development arrangements.\nWe are also currently incurring and expect to continue to incur additional incremental expenses associated with being a stand-alone company. These incremental pretax expenses were approximately $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this report may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. This is primarily because:\n\u00b7 our historical financial information reflects allocations for services historically provided to us by Ikaria, which allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as a stand-alone company; and\n\u00b7 our historical financial information does not reflect changes that we expect to incur in the future as a result of our separation from Ikaria and from reduced economies of scale, including changes in the cost structure, personnel needs, financing and operations of our business.\nIn addition, as a newly public company, we are also responsible for the additional costs associated with being a public company, including costs related to corporate governance and having listed and registered securities. Therefore, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance as a stand-alone public company.\nFor additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our financial statements, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe ownership by certain of our executive officers and directors of equity of Ikaria, as well as the continued roles of certain of our directors with Ikaria, may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Ikaria, our chief business officer, Manesh Naidu, our chief clinical development officer, Reinilde Heyrman, our chief scientific officer, Martin Meglasson, our treasurer, David Abrams, and one of our directors, Daniel Tass\u00e9, own equity in Ikaria. In addition, two of our directors, Matthew Holt and Adam B. Weinstein, may be deemed to beneficially own equity in Ikaria. Such equity ownership may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest. The individual holdings of equity of Ikaria may be significant for some of these persons compared to such person\u2019s total assets. Ownership by certain of our executive officers and directors of equity of Ikaria creates, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these officers or directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Ikaria than the decisions have for us. In addition, Matthew Holt and Daniel Tass\u00e9 are currently serving on our board of directors as well as Ikaria\u2019s board of directors, and Mr. Tass\u00e9 is currently serving as the chief executive officer of Ikaria. The continued service at both companies creates, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Ikaria than the decisions have for us, such as the allocation of time and resources to the provision of transitional services to us by Ikaria pursuant to the TSA, the 2015 Services Agreement and the other agreements.\nWe face substantial competition from other pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies and our operating results may suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates. In addition, other companies are increasingly looking at the cardiopulmonary and cardiac disease market as a potential opportunity. Currently, there are 12 drugs approved for the treatment of PAH, within the following categories: prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs (including Flolan\u00ae (epoprostenol), which is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, Tyvaso\u00ae (treprostinil), Orenitram\u00ae (treprostinil) and Remodulin\u00ae (treprostinil), which are marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation, and Ventavis\u00ae (iloprost) and Veletri\u00ae (epoprostenol), which are marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc., or Actelion), phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (including Adcirca\u00ae (tadalafil), which is marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation, and Revatio\u00ae (sildenafil), which is marketed by Pfizer Inc.), endothelin receptor antagonists (including Letairis\u00ae (ambrisentan), which is marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Opsumit\u00ae (macitentan) and Tracleer\u00ae (bosentan), which are marketed by Actelion) and a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (Adempas\u00ae (riociguat), which is marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Actelion recently submitted an NDA to the FDA for selexipag, a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist. There are also other treatments in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical development, including other nitric oxide generation and delivery systems, including GeNOsyl, which is being developed by GeNO LLC, and a nebulized formulation of nitrite, which is being developed by Mast Therapeutics.\nCurrently, there are no approved therapies for treating PH-COPD, and the only generally accepted treatments are LTOT, pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplant, and we are not aware of any therapies for PH-COPD in advanced clinical development.\nThere are no generally accepted products approved for structural support to prevent cardiac remodeling following an AMI. Other product candidates that are currently in clinical development include stem cell therapies to restore heart muscle cells following an AMI, with large Phase 3 trials expected to be completed in 2018 or 2019. We do not expect BCM to compete with, or replace, current treatments for congestive heart failure following AMI, but instead believe it will become part of the treatment regimen used in conjunction with other therapies. In addition, because BCM can be delivered by a minimally invasive percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, we do not believe it will directly compete with devices that are used to treat congestive heart failure, which are designed for administration during open heart surgery or by intra-cardiac injection involving a thoracotomy procedure. These include: mesh restraining devices, for example HeartNet; injectable biopolymers, for example Algisyl-LVR; and implantable electro stimulation devices, for example, CardioFit. In addition, volume reduction surgery or cardiac assist devices, or pumps, are sometimes used to treat patients with congestive heart failure.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or through their strategic partners, have substantially greater name recognition and financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience and infrastructure in the research and clinical development of medical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of those products, and commercializing those products around the world. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Large pharmaceutical and medical device companies in particular have extensive expertise in pre-clinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for medical products. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining approval for inhaled nitric oxide products and achieving widespread market acceptance. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products and technologies become available.\nWe will not be able to compete effectively unless we successfully:\n\u00b7 design, develop and commercialize products that are superior to other products in the market;\n\u00b7 attract qualified scientific, medical, sales and marketing, engineering and commercial personnel;\n\u00b7 obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates; and\n\u00b7 obtain required regulatory approvals.\nIt is also possible that Ikaria will seek to develop and commercialize inhaled nitric oxide products or product candidates in PAH, PH-COPD and/or PH-IPF. While a subsidiary of Ikaria has granted to us an exclusive license to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF and the scope of that license includes certain technology developed or acquired by that subsidiary after the date of the license agreement, the license does not include technology developed or acquired by other subsidiaries or affiliates of Ikaria. Because Ikaria and its subsidiaries and affiliates are not subject to any non-competition obligations in our favor, it is possible that these other subsidiaries or affiliates of Ikaria may seek to develop or commercialize inhaled nitric oxide or other products or product candidates, using technology not exclusively licensed to us, that are competitive with our products or product candidates.\nRisks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are dependent on the success of our INOpulse and BCM product candidates and our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize these product candidates. If we are unable to develop, obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates, either alone or through a collaboration, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our INOpulse for PAH, INOpulse for PH-COPD and BCM product candidates. Our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize these product candidates. The success of our product candidates will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully complete clinical trials of each product candidate. The clinical trial process is uncertain, and failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. For example, although we believe our recently completed Phase 2 clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD support advancement into a Phase 3 and a Phase 2b clinical trial, respectively, the primary endpoints for both INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD were not statistically significant for any of the doses tested.\nIn addition to the successful completion of clinical trials, the success of our product candidates will also depend on several other factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 establishment of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers;\n\u00b7 establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished drug products that are appropriately packaged for sale;\n\u00b7 the performance of our future collaborators for one or more of our product candidates, if any;\n\u00b7 the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u00b7 protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 launch of commercial sales if and when our product candidates are approved;\n\u00b7 a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates following any marketing approval;\n\u00b7 commercial acceptance, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u00b7 establishing and maintaining pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment; and\n\u00b7 competition with other products.\nIf we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates, or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be materially harmed.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe recently completed Phase 2 clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD and are currently conducting a clinical trial of BCM. The risk of failure of all of our product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of severe or medically or commercially unacceptable adverse events, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the FDA or any comparable non-U.S. regulatory authority that a drug product is not approvable. For example, although we believe our recently completed Phase 2 clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD support advancement into a Phase 3 and a Phase 2b clinical trial, respectively, the primary endpoints for both INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD were not statistically significant for any of the doses tested.\nIt is possible that even if one or more of our product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in our clinical trials we may fail to detect toxicity of or intolerability caused by our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case. Also, the exclusion criteria we define may not sufficiently rule out patients who are at a higher risk of being harmed by the treatment. For example, our exclusion criteria for pre-existing left heart dysfunction in our recently completed Phase 2 INOpulse clinical trials may not rule out patients who may experience an adverse event related to left ventricular function due to exposure to nitric oxide. In addition, patients who are not excluded for reactive pulmonary vasculature when exposed to nitric oxide may still experience pulmonary hypertension.\nThe outcome of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, particularly when earlier trials are small, open-label or non-placebo-controlled trials and in trials that have different endpoints than earlier trials. For example, we are relying on the results from a 32-patient Phase 2 PH-COPD trial, conducted in Austria, as part of our clinical development program of INOpulse for PH-COPD, and we may not be able to replicate the results of this trial in a larger trial or in a trial that uses a clinical endpoint rather than the anatomical endpoints used in the 32-patient trial. Similarly, for BCM, we are using the results of the 27-patient pilot trial conducted by BioLineRx Ltd. that used anatomical changes to measure efficacy and did not have a control group as support for our larger ongoing clinical trial, which may not achieve the same results as the BioLineRx Ltd. trial. Many companies in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face such setbacks.\nThe design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant\nmarketing approval, the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Any Phase 3 or other clinical trials that we may conduct may not demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nINOpulse is a sophisticated electro-mechanical device comprised of components that may fail or deteriorate over time or with improper use. If we experience problems with, failure of, or delays in obtaining any INOpulse components, our business could be materially adversely harmed.\nBecause INOpulse is a sophisticated electro-mechanical device, the parts which comprise the device are subject to sudden failure or to wear and tear, which may result in decreased function or failure of those parts over time. Although we perform scheduled, preventive maintenance on our drug delivery system to limit device failures, and additional maintenance as needed whenever a user reports a device malfunction, components of our devices may fail. In addition, although we have designed INOpulse to be simple and easy to use and will provide user manuals and other training materials, users of INOpulse may use the devices improperly, which could cause the devices to fail or otherwise not work properly.\nThere are several components in INOpulse that are custom designed or assembled for us. We are dependent on a single company to supply us with some of these components. While we believe there are alternative suppliers from which we could purchase most of these components, there is a risk that a single-source supplier could fail to deliver adequate supply, or could suffer a business interruption that could affect our supply of these components.\nWe obtain some of the components for INOpulse through individual purchase orders executed on an as needed basis rather than pursuant to long-term supply agreements. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third-party suppliers or manufacturers experience production problems, lack of capacity or transportation disruptions or otherwise cease producing such components.\nWe are transitioning our INOpulse delivery system to a next generation device that was not utilized in our recently completed INOpulse Phase 2 clinical trials. Failure by the FDA or other regulatory authority to support the transition and bridging strategy for our transition to the new device could increase our development costs and/or delay commencement of our future clinical trials of INOpulse.\nOur recently completed INOpulse Phase 2 clinical trials utilized the first generation INOpulse DS device. We are near completion of a second generation INOpulse device, the Mark2, and we plan to transition our INOpulse delivery system from INOpulse DS to the Mark2 for any future INOpulse clinical trials. To facilitate the transition from our existing INOpulse DS device to the Mark2 in our clinical program, we plan to conduct comparability testing of nitric oxide dosing with the Mark2 as compared to the INOpulse DS device. This testing will include a comparison of critical parameters, including pulse width and nitric oxide output. We will also assess whether the Mark2 will meet the performance specifications of the INOpulse DS device in addition to Mark2-specific requirements. In addition, we are developing a bridging test report that we expect to include in the regulatory package that we anticipate submitting to the FDA during the first half of 2015 to gain approval for the device transition. We discussed our strategy with the FDA during a meeting in May 2013, and we believe that, assuming the Mark2 meets the specified comparability parameters, this testing will be sufficient to gain FDA approval to use the Mark2 in future clinical trials, as planned. The FDA may not agree that our data support transition to this new device, in which case we may be required to provide additional data, perform a revised bridging assessment or repeat the Phase 2 clinical trial, any of which could increase our development\ncosts and/or delay or prevent commencement of these future clinical trials. In addition, even if the FDA accepts our transition plan, use of the Mark2 in future clinical trials could produce results that are different than those we would expect based on the results from the Phase 2 clinical trial using the INOpulse DS device.\nWe intend to conduct, and may in the future conduct, clinical trials for certain of our product candidates at sites outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nWe have conducted, and may in the future choose to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. For example, our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH included sites in Canada and our clinical trial of BCM includes sites in Europe, Canada, Australia and Israel.\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with GCP in the case of drug trials, or the Declaration of Helsinki or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords greater protection to the human subjects, in the case of device trials. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical trials conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to seek approval in the United States. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in Canada or our clinical trial of BCM in Europe, Canada, Australia or Israel, or any future trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of INOpulse for PAH and BCM or any future product candidates.\nIn addition, the conduct of clinical trials outside the United States could have a significant impact on us. Risks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include:\n\u00b7 foreign regulatory requirements that could restrict or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple foreign regulatory schema;\n\u00b7 foreign exchange fluctuations; and\n\u00b7 diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the FDA and comparable non-U.S. regulators, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of these product candidates.\nWe are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, such as the EMA, impose similar restrictions. We may never receive such approvals. We must complete extensive pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans before we will be able to obtain these approvals.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. We have not previously submitted an NDA to the FDA or similar drug approval filings to comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.\nAny inability to successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us and impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales. In addition, if (1) we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond the trials and testing that we contemplate, (2) we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, (3) the results of these trials or tests are unfavorable, uncertain or are only modestly favorable, such as in our Phase 2 clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD, or (4) there are unacceptable safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we, in addition to incurring additional costs, may:\n\u00b7 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u00b7 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired;\n\u00b7 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u00b7 be subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements; or\n\u00b7 be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nFor example, the FDA has granted us an IDE for our ongoing clinical trial of BCM, which we refer to as our PRESERVATION I trial, which currently limits at 60 the number of patients we can enroll in the United States. This limitation is due to the novelty of BCM and the lack of prior data on administration to human patients of four milliliters of BCM that we are using in the trial because we did not conduct a pilot study of BCM with the four milliliter volume. Due to the lack of a pilot study or other data supporting the safety or efficacy of four milliliters of BCM in human patients, the FDA may require that, prior to approval, we conduct additional trials of BCM or that we provide additional data to support the safety and/or efficacy of four milliliters of BCM in human patients.\nIn addition, the FDA has asked us to conduct a study to test the environmental impact of using INOpulse at home. When inhaled nitric oxide is administered through INOpulse, a small portion of the nitric oxide will be exhaled or otherwise emitted and could react with oxygen in room air to form nitrogen dioxide, which is an environmental pollutant. The study will measure the nitrogen dioxide in the room air with use of INOpulse under actual or simulated patient use conditions. If the FDA or other regulatory authority requires us to conduct additional testing or determines that an unacceptable amount of nitrogen dioxide is formed through the use of INOpulse, we may be required to alter the design of INOpulse, which may not be possible, and the clinical development timeline for INOpulse may be delayed or prove to be more costly than we currently anticipate.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials of our product candidates, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent marketing approval of our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7 clinical trials of our product candidates may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results;\n\u00b7 we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u00b7 the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 our third-party contractors, including those manufacturing our product candidates or components or ingredients thereof or conducting clinical trials on our behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7 we may experience delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u00b7 patients who enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to withdraw such patients from the clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or extend the clinical trial\u2019s duration;\n\u00b7 we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of a product candidate;\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their respective standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar drug or drug candidate;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design or our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities may find regulatory non-compliance with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u00b7 the supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply; and\n\u00b7 the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient to obtain marketing approval.\nProduct development costs for us will increase if we experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals and we may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization of our product candidates. We do not know whether any pre-clinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. For example, although we recently completed a Phase 2 clinical trial for INOpulse for PH-COPD, we are currently evaluating our options for further Phase 2 development in this indication. Significant pre-clinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to\nsuccessfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, we may not achieve our clinical development on our anticipated timeline, or at all, and our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our INOpulse or BCM product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in clinical trials. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, and is affected by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u00b7 the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u00b7 the proximity of patients to clinical sites;\n\u00b7 the eligibility criteria for the trial;\n\u00b7 the design of the clinical trial;\n\u00b7 limitations placed on enrollment by regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment;\n\u00b7 competing clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new product candidates that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nFor example, we may experience difficulty enrolling our clinical trials, including, but not limited to, any future clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH, which is an orphan disease due to the small number of patients who suffer from PAH, or any future clinical trials of INOpulse for PH-COPD because such trials may require that patients meet the restrictive enrollment criteria, such as having been diagnosed with both COPD and pulmonary hypertension, be undergoing treatment with LTOT and not having significant left ventricular dysfunction.\nIn addition, with respect to our PRESERVATION I trial, the FDA has limited us to enrolling a maximum of 60 patients in the United States. This limitation is due to the novelty of BCM and the lack of prior data on the administration to human patients of four milliliters of BCM that we are using in the trial because we did not conduct a pilot study of BCM with this dose. We will need to obtain the FDA\u2019s approval of any expansion of this U.S. enrollment cap, and such approval would likely be based on our submission of data to the FDA supporting the safety of four milliliters of BCM in human patients, if any. The Israeli Ministry of Health is also requiring that we submit to it additional safety data once 70 patients are enrolled in Israel.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials could result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, delay or halt the development of and approval processes for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to achieve our clinical development timeline and goals, including the dates by which we will commence, complete and receive results from clinical trials. Enrollment delays may also delay or jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate revenues from our product candidates. Any of the foregoing could cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed.\nWe may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity, or we may not receive the full benefit of orphan drug exclusivity even if we obtain such exclusivity.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and European Union, may designate drugs and biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States who have been diagnosed as having the disease or condition at the time of the submission of the request for orphan drug designation. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to our nitric oxide program for the treatment of PAH. Accordingly, the first company to receive FDA approval for nitric oxide for the treatment of PAH will obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not approve another product containing nitric oxide as its active ingredient for the treatment of PAH, unless such product is shown to be clinically superior.\nEven though we have obtained orphan drug designation for our nitric oxide program to treat PAH, and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our product candidates in other indications or for our future product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication, or we may not obtain approval for an indication for which we have obtained orphan drug designation. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not protect the product effectively from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of our product candidates may be identified during development that could delay or prevent the product candidate\u2019s marketing approval.\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product candidates could cause us, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities. If any of our product candidates is associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many drugs or devices that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the drug or device.\nFor example, in our recently completed Phase 2 clinical trial for INOpulse for PAH, serious adverse events were reported for four patients in the 25 mcg/kg ideal body weight/hour, or mcg, low-dose active treatment arm, including bacteremia, myelodysplastic syndrome, increased shortness of breath and dyspnea, one of which was assessed as possibly related to trial therapy. In the 75 mcg high-dose active treatment arm, nine patients had serious adverse events. The most common serious adverse events reported were syncope and bronchitis/tracheobronchitis, one of which was assessed as possibly related to trial therapy. Discontinuation of trial therapy due to adverse events occurred for two patients in the 75 mcg arm and one subject in the 25 mcg arm. Additional or more serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of INOpulse for PAH or our other product candidates could arise or become known either during further clinical development. If such an event occurs during development, clinical trials for our product candidates could be\nsuspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us or our collaborators to cease further development, require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other tests or studies or deny approval of the applicable product candidate. Further, pending discussions with regulatory authorities, we may be required to conduct a drug-drug interaction study of INOpulse for PH-COPD. We expect the FDA to require us primarily to study interactions with long-acting beta agonists, which is the only class of COPD drug that has been identified as having potential adverse cardiac side effects, to confirm that pulsed inhaled nitric oxide does not increase systemic bio-availability of inhaled beta agonists. If the results of such a study indicate increased bioavailability that we are not able to address to the satisfaction of the FDA, marketing approval of INOpulse for PH-COPD, if any, may be limited to patients who do not use long-acting beta agonists.\nAdditionally, INOpulse is an extension of the technology that is used in hospitals to deliver inhaled nitric oxide to neonates with a form of pulmonary hypertension called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Persistent pulmonary hypertension is an FDA-approved use of inhaled nitric oxide, which is currently marketed by Ikaria as INOmax. Because INOpulse draws on the established efficacy and safety of INOmax, if any serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of INOmax or other inhaled nitric oxide delivery systems developed by Ikaria are identified, INOpulse may be adversely affected and we may be required to interrupt, delay or halt our INOpulse clinical trials.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional potential product candidates.\nA significant portion of the research that we are conducting involves the development of innovative approaches to the pulsed delivery of nitric oxide. Our drug-device discovery efforts may not be successful in creating drugs or devices that have commercial value or therapeutic utility. Our research programs may initially show promise in creating potential product candidates, yet fail to yield viable product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including that potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be product candidates that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. Currently, we are dependent on Ikaria for our business development functions pursuant to the TSA and lack the capability to bring such functions in-house. Accordingly, if Ikaria does not perform such business development functions effectively, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur research programs to identify new product candidates will require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to identify new potential product candidates. In addition, we may focus our efforts and resources on one or more potential product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nPursuant to the terms of our license agreement with Ikaria, we only have the right to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF; Ikaria retains the right to develop and commercialize inhaled nitric oxide products, including pulsed products, in all other indications. Additionally, we are limited in the scope of potential product candidates that we can identify or discover due to non-competition agreements that we entered into with Ikaria. Pursuant to these agreements, we and each of our subsidiaries agreed not to engage, anywhere in the world, in any manner, directly or indirectly, until the earlier of five years after the effective date of such non-competition agreement or the date on which Ikaria and all of its subsidiaries are no longer engaged in such business, in:\n\u00b7 the development, manufacture, commercialization, promotion, sale, import, export, servicing, repair, training, storage, distribution, transportation, licensing, or other handling or disposition of any product or service (including, without limitation, any product or service that utilizes, contains or includes nitric oxide for inhalation, a device intended to deliver nitric oxide or a service that delivers or supports the delivery of nitric oxide), bundled or unbundled, for or used in connection with (a) the diagnosis, prevention or treatment, in both adult and/or pediatric populations, and whether in- or out-patient, of: (i) hypoxic respiratory failure associated with pulmonary hypertension,\n(ii) pulmonary hypertensive episodes and right heart failure associated with cardiovascular surgery, (iii) bronchopulmonary dysplasia, (iv) the management of ventilation-perfusion mismatch in acute lung injury, (v) the management of ventilation-perfusion mismatch in acute respiratory distress syndrome, (vi) the management of pulmonary hypertension episodes and right heart failure in congestive heart failure, (vii) pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness, (viii) the management of pulmonary hypertension episodes and right heart failure in pulmonary or cardiac surgery, (ix) the management of pulmonary hypertension episodes and right heart failure in organ transplant, (x) sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis, (xi) hypoxia associated with pneumonia or (xii) ischemia-reperfusion injury or (b) the use of nitric oxide to treat or prevent conditions that are primarily managed in the hospital; or\n\u00b7 any and all development, manufacture, commercialization, promotion, sale, import, export, storage, distribution, transportation, licensing, or other handling or disposition of any terlipressin or any other product within the pressin family, (a) intended to treat (i) hepatorenal syndrome in any form, (ii) bleeding esophageal varices or (iii) septic shock or (b) for or in connection with the management of low blood pressure.\nIn the event that we or one of our subsidiaries materially breach the provisions of the non-competition agreements and do not cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof from Ikaria, Ikaria will have the right to terminate the license agreement.\nIf we are unable to identify suitable additional compounds for pre-clinical and clinical development, or at all, our ability to develop product candidates and obtain product revenues in future periods could be compromised, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we, or others, later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability to market the product could be compromised.\nClinical trials of our product candidates are conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, we, or others, discover that the drug is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following undesirable events could occur:\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\u00b7 we may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered;\n\u00b7 additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u00b7 we may be required to create a handout, sometimes referred to as a Medication Guide, outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u00b7 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u00b7 the product may become less competitive; and\n\u00b7 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price.\nEven if one of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success, and the market opportunity for the product candidate may be smaller than we estimate.\nWe have never commercialized a product. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of reimbursement for existing therapies.\nEfforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. If any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of, and potential market opportunity for, our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u00b7 the potential advantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7 the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u00b7 whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy;\n\u00b7 limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u00b7 our ability to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment;\n\u00b7 our ability to prevent use of our INOpulse for PH-COPD device by PAH patients due to expected pricing differences;\n\u00b7 the product\u2019s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n\u00b7 the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7 the approval of other new products for the same indications;\n\u00b7 changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product;\n\u00b7 the timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products and other therapies;\n\u00b7 availability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n\u00b7 adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u00b7 potential product liability claims.\nThe potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities, including our estimates with respect to pricing and reimbursement, are predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain and the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into acceptable sales, marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing any product candidates that we develop, if and when those product candidates are approved.\nWe do not have a sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure and have limited experience in the sale, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We expect to build a commercial infrastructure to allow us to market and sell certain of our product candidates when approved, if any, using a specialty sales force in the United States, and we may choose to establish commercialization capabilities in select countries outside the United States. The development of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities will require substantial resources, will be time-consuming and could delay any product launch. We expect that we will commence the development of these capabilities prior to receiving approval of any of our product candidates. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing and distribution capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we could have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization costs. Such a delay may be costly, and our investment could be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. In addition, we may not be able to hire or retain a sales force in the United States that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we plan to target. If we are unable to establish or retain a sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, our operating results may be adversely affected. If a potential partner has development or commercialization expertise that we believe is particularly relevant to one of our product candidates, then we may seek to collaborate with that potential partner even if we believe we could otherwise develop and commercialize the product independently.\nWe may partner with third parties to commercialize our product candidates in certain countries outside the United States. As a result of entering into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues may be lower, perhaps substantially lower, than if we were to directly market and sell products in those markets. Furthermore, we may be unsuccessful in entering into the necessary arrangements with third parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may have little or no control over such third parties, and any of\nthem may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our product candidates effectively.\nIf we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidate that we develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party payor reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives that could harm our business.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend substantially, both in the United States and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs and devices. Marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug and device products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug or device before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some non-U.S. markets, pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. These payors may not view our products, if any, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers, or may not be sufficient to allow our products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues. If the prices for our products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer. Approval of a product does not guarantee sufficient reimbursement to commercialize. For example, assuming positive results, approval of CE marking for BCM in the European Union may be achieved with our ongoing clinical trial but, based on current reimbursement practices in the European Union, this data may not be sufficient to gain sufficient reimbursement for us to invest in commercialization activities.\nThere may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.\nIn addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nWe anticipate that reimbursement of BCM will be based on the patient\u2019s diagnosis related group, or DRG, for patients who are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, or through similar reimbursement programs for patients to who are covered by private third-party payors. Within the DRG system, patients are classified by similar diagnoses, which are mapped from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or ICD, a medical classification list provided by the World Health Organization. The version of ICD that is currently in use with respect to DRG classifications is ICD-9. However, an updated version, ICD-10, has been adopted. We expect that DRG classifications will be required to be mapped against ICD-10 by October 2015 and, as a result, we believe that the DRG classifications will be mapped from ICD-10 rather than ICD-9 at the time we commercialize BCM, if ever, which would result in favorable reimbursement. However, if ICD-9 continues to be used for DRG classification mapping by hospitals or Medicare or Medicaid or other payors, or our expectations with respect to the applicable DRG classification prove incorrect, reimbursement for BCM may prove less favorable or inadequate. In addition, even if ICD-10 is adopted for reimbursement assessments, the mapping to the DRGs, or the amount reimbursed for the DRGs, may change, all of which could adversely affect the ability of our customers to gain sufficient reimbursement, and therefore, the adoption of, or price we could charge for, BCM.\nIf the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve generic versions of any of our products that receive marketing approval, or such authorities do not grant our products appropriate periods of data exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, the sales of our products could be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201creference listed drug\u201d in the FDA\u2019s publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.\u201d Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of ANDAs in the United States, or through a similar process in foreign jurisdictions. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical studies. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug may be typically lost to the generic product.\nThe FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. Manufacturers may seek to launch these generic products following the expiration of the applicable marketing exclusivity period, even if we still have patent protection for our product.\nCompetition that our products may face from generic versions of our products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could divert our resources, cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants. We will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any product that we may develop. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. For example:\n\u00b7 improper use or failure of INOpulse may result in rebound pulmonary hypertension, which can be fatal in some patients;\n\u00b7 rebound pulmonary hypertension may also occur if both the primary and back-up devices fail before we can replace them, if the built-in back-up with a device does not work properly or if the patient does not carry or have access to his or her back-up device; and\n\u00b7 rebound pulmonary hypertension can also occur in patients who were not previously considered at risk for this reaction and who may not have been provided an adequate back-up device.\nClaims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for products that we may develop;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 significant costs to defend resulting litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue;\n\u00b7 reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nAlthough we maintain general liability insurance of $1.0 million in the aggregate, umbrella insurance in the amount of $10.0 million in the aggregate and clinical trial liability insurance of $20.0 million in the aggregate, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities that we may incur. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. We will need to increase our insurance coverage if and when we begin the commercial sale of any product candidate that receives marketing approval. In addition, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, it could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur INOpulse devices use lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and these events may raise concerns about the batteries we use.\nThe battery pack used in our INOpulse devices makes use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. There can be no assurance that the battery packs we use would not fail, which could lead to property damage, personal injury or death, and may subject us to lawsuits. We may also have to recall our products, if any, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative perceptions in the healthcare and patient communities regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for medical applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells could seriously harm our business, even in the absence of an incident involving us.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nThe intellectual property underlying INOpulse is exclusively licensed from Ikaria. If Ikaria terminates the license agreement, or fails to prosecute, maintain or enforce the underlying patents, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have licensed the intellectual property underlying INOpulse from Ikaria. Despite our best efforts, Ikaria may conclude that we have breached a material term of the license agreement and, as a result, seek to terminate the agreement. In the event the license agreement is terminated, we will lose our ability to market INOpulse, and, upon Ikaria\u2019s written request, we will be required to transfer any regulatory approvals that we have obtained for INOpulse to Ikaria.\nThe license agreement prohibits us from sublicensing to any competitor of Ikaria any intellectual property licensed to us by Ikaria. In addition, we are required to ensure that all of our products, if any, are used solely for the chronic treatment of PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF and to enter into written agreements with any\ncustomers that contain restrictions on the use of our products and termination rights in the event such restrictions are violated.\nIkaria has the initial right, but not the obligation, to prosecute and maintain all patents that are licensed to us pursuant to the license agreement. While we have certain step-in rights to assume control if Ikaria declines to file, prosecute or maintain certain licensed patents that are core to our business, in the event Ikaria reasonably determines that our actions could materially impair its business operations or intellectual property rights, Ikaria may prohibit us from taking such actions. In addition, Ikaria has the initial right, but not the obligation, to initiate a legal action against a third party with respect to any actual or suspected infringement of patent rights licensed to us pursuant to the license agreement. We have the right to initiate legal action against a third-party infringer of licensed patents that are core to our business in the event Ikaria declines to take action with respect to such infringement, however, if Ikaria determines that our pursuit of any such action could materially impair its business operations or intellectual property rights, Ikaria may prohibit us from taking any such action.\nThe license agreement terminates, on an INOpulse product-by-INOpulse product basis, at such time as we are no longer actively and continuously engaged in the development or commercialization of such product. In addition, Ikaria may terminate the license agreement if, among other things, (1) we breach or fail to comply with any material term or condition required to be performed or complied with by us and do not cure such breach or failure within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach from Ikaria, (2) we or any of our affiliates breaches any of our agreements not to compete with Ikaria, (3) we or any of our affiliates challenges the validity or enforceability of the licensed patents or (4) we or any person that is a successor to our license rights markets a generic nitric oxide product that is competitive with Ikaria\u2019s INOmax product. Upon termination of the license agreement with respect to any INOpulse product candidate, we will lose our ability to market such INOpulse product candidate, and upon, Ikaria\u2019s written request, be required to transfer any and all regulatory approvals relating to such INOpulse product candidate to Ikaria.\nOn March 5, 2015, Mallinckrodt and Ikaria announced that the two companies had entered into a definitive agreement under which a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt will acquire Ikaria and that they expect the acquisition will be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2015. While the license agreement imposes binding obligations on Ikaria to perform in accordance with the license agreement\u2019s terms, it is possible that following completion of the sale, as the new owner\u2019s influence on Ikaria\u2019s operations increases, Ikaria may perform differently under the license agreement than it has to date. Moreover, to the extent that we desire to expand the scope of the license agreement, it is possible that Ikaria will not be willing to do so on reasonable terms, or at all. In any of these circumstances, our business, product development and financial statements could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe currently rely on third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our clinical trials. Our agreements with these third parties generally allow the third party to terminate the agreement at any time. If we are required to enter into alternative arrangements because of any such termination, the introduction of our product candidates to market could be delayed.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we design our clinical trials and will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. We\nalso are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug and device supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe rely on Ikaria for our supply of nitric oxide for the clinical trials of INOpulse. Ikaria is the sole supplier of nitric oxide. Ikaria\u2019s inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of nitric oxide, or its refusal to supply us with commercial quantities of nitric oxide on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could result in a disruption in the supply of, or impair our ability to market, INOpulse.\nWe have entered into a drug clinical supply agreement with Ikaria, pursuant to which Ikaria will manufacture and supply our requirements for nitric oxide for inhalation and corresponding placebo for use in clinical trials of INOpulse. Ikaria manufactures pharmaceutical-grade nitric oxide at its facility in Port Allen, Louisiana, which is the only FDA-inspected site for manufacturing pharmaceutical-grade nitric oxide in the world. Ikaria\u2019s Port Allen facility is subject to the risks of a natural disaster or other business disruption. We maintain under controlled storage conditions a two- to three-month supply of clinical trial drug product, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to meet our requirements for INOpulse if there were a catastrophic event or failure of Ikaria\u2019s manufacturing system. Because Ikaria\u2019s Port Allen facility is the only FDA-inspected site that can manufacture INOpulse and because the manufacture of a pharmaceutical gas requires specialized equipment and expertise, there are few, if any, third-party manufacturers to which we could contract this work in a short period of time. Therefore, any disruption in Ikaria\u2019s Port Allen facility, or the failure by Ikaria for any other reason to provide us with nitric oxide, could materially and adversely affect supplies of INOpulse and our ongoing and planned clinical trials. In addition, we do not currently have any arrangements with Ikaria to provide us with commercial quantities of nitric oxide. If we are unable to arrange for Ikaria to provide such quantities on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may not be able to successfully produce and market INOpulse or may be delayed in doing so.\nOn March 5, 2015, Mallinckrodt and Ikaria announced that the two companies had entered into a definitive agreement under which a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt will acquire Ikaria and that they expect the acquisition will be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2015. While the drug clinical supply agreement imposes binding obligations on Ikaria to perform in accordance with the agreement\u2019s terms, it is possible that following completion of the sale, as the new owner\u2019s influence on Ikaria\u2019s operations increases, Ikaria may not continue to provide the same level of performance under the drug clinical supply agreement as Ikaria has provided to date. Moreover, to the extent that we desire to expand the scope of the drug clinical supply agreement (to cover commercial quantities of nitric oxide or otherwise), it is also possible that Ikaria will not be willing to do so on reasonable terms, or at all. In any of these circumstances, our business, product development and financial statements could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce and deliver clinical devices and supplies as well as for the servicing of these devices for our INOpulse product candidate, and may also do so for other product candidates. Any failure by a third-party supplier or manufacturer to produce or deliver supplies for us or to provide necessary servicing may delay or impair our ability to complete our clinical trials.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for supply of the device, cannula and certain other supplies for our INOpulse product candidate. These suppliers are, and any future third-party suppliers with whom we enter into agreements may be, our sole suppliers of these devices or any of our other current or future devices used in the INOpulse program. These suppliers are commonly referred to as single-source suppliers. In addition, in February 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics to manufacture and service the Mark2 devices needed for our clinical trials planned in the second half of 2015. If our suppliers fail to deliver materials and provide services needed for the production of the INOpulse device and related supplies or for our other product candidates in a timely and sufficient manner, if they fail to comply with applicable regulations, or if we do not qualify alternate suppliers, clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products could be delayed, increasing our costs to complete clinical development and to obtain regulatory approval, which could deprive us of potential additional product revenue.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce and deliver clinical drug supplies for our BCM product candidate and may also do so for other product candidates. Any failure by a third-party supplier or manufacturer to produce or deliver supplies for us may delay or impair our ability to complete our clinical trials.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for supply of the ingredients for our BCM product candidate. These suppliers are, and any future third-party suppliers with whom we enter into agreements may be, our sole suppliers of BCM or any of our other current or future product candidates. These suppliers are commonly referred to as single-source suppliers. If our suppliers fail to deliver materials and provide services needed for the production of BCM or our other product candidates in a timely and sufficient manner, if they fail to comply with applicable regulations, or if we do not qualify alternate suppliers, clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products could be delayed, increasing our costs to complete clinical development and to obtain regulatory approval, which could deprive us of potential additional product revenue.\nIn addition, we currently outsource the manufacture of BCM for use in clinical trials pursuant to the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement with a third-party which expires in April 2017. We plan to enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement for BCM with a new third-party manufacturer prior to April 2017. If we fail to enter into a new manufacturing and supply agreement for BCM with a third-party prior to the expiration of our existing manufacturing and supply agreement or if such new agreement is on less favorable terms, our ability to complete our clinical trials for BCM may be impaired.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, fines, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production or injunctions.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials from third-party suppliers. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture our product candidates. Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion or increase the costs of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nWe intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates. Any failure by a third-party supplier or manufacturer to produce or deliver supplies for us may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nTo date, our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If one or more of our product candidates are approved by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other countries for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture such product candidate in larger quantities. We do not currently have any arrangements with Ikaria or another third-party manufacturer to provide commercial quantities of our product candidates. If we are unable to arrange for such a third-party manufacturing source, or fail to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to successfully produce and market our product candidates or may be delayed in doing so.\nIf we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we may be required to establish or access large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates, and we currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities.\nOur BCM product candidate currently in development is exclusively licensed from BioLineRx Ltd., and we may enter into additional agreements to in-license technology from third parties. If BioLineRx Ltd. or other future licensors terminate the applicable license, or fail to maintain or enforce the underlying patents, our competitive position and market share will be harmed.\nWe have an exclusive worldwide license for our BCM product candidate, subject to certain retained rights of the licensor, from BioLine. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing BCM. BioLine has the right to terminate its license agreement with us for an uncured material breach by us, upon which our exclusive license for BCM will terminate.\nWe have also exclusively licensed INOpulse, for certain indications and settings, and subject to certain retained rights of the licensor, from Ikaria. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions-Relationship with Ikaria\u201d for a summary of our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria.\nWe may enter into additional license agreements as part of the development of our business in the future. Such licensors, if any, may be responsible for prosecution of certain patent applications and maintenance of certain patents. Such licensors may not successfully prosecute such patent applications or maintain such patents, which we have licensed and on which our business depends. Our licensors may fail to pursue litigation against third-party infringers, may fail to prove infringement, or may fail to defend against counterclaims of patent invalidity or unenforceability. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended market exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of,\nand to market, products identical to ours. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nWe may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Ikaria.\nThe agreements related to the Spin-Out, including the separation and distribution agreement, TSA, license agreement, drug clinical supply agreement, device clinical supply agreement, agreements not to compete and the other agreements, were negotiated in the context of our separation from Ikaria while we were still part of Ikaria and, accordingly, may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements we negotiated in the context of our separation related to, among other things, allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations among Ikaria and us. We may have received better terms from third parties because third parties may have competed with each other to win our business. Some of our board members are also members of the Ikaria board. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions-Relationship with Ikaria.\u201d\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Ikaria that we did not assume in our agreements.\nIn connection with our separation from Ikaria, Ikaria has generally agreed to retain all liabilities that did not historically arise from our business. Third parties may seek to hold us responsible for Ikaria\u2019s retained liabilities. Under our agreements with Ikaria, Ikaria has agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses relating to these retained liabilities. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately liable for them, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Ikaria.\nAny disputes that arise between us and Ikaria with respect to our past and ongoing relationships could harm our business operations.\nDisputes may arise between Ikaria and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u00b7 intellectual property, technology and business matters, including failure to make required technology transfers and failure to comply with non-compete provisions applicable to Ikaria and us;\n\u00b7 labor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Ikaria;\n\u00b7 distribution and supply obligations;\n\u00b7 employee retention and recruiting;\n\u00b7 business combinations involving us;\n\u00b7 the nature, quality and pricing of transitional services Ikaria has agreed to provide us; and\n\u00b7 business opportunities that may be attractive to both Ikaria and us.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nWe may seek to enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If we fail to enter into such collaborations, or such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our product candidates.\nWe may seek third-party collaborators for development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our likely collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical and medical device companies, regional and national biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical companies. We are not currently party to any such arrangement. However, if we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties in the future, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates would pose the following risks to us:\n\u00b7 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u00b7 collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7 collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7 collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u00b7 disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u00b7 collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug and device development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. The terms of our current or future license agreements may restrict our ability to enter into agreements on certain terms with future collaborators. For example, our license agreement with Ikaria prohibits us from granting a sublicense under any of the intellectual property licensed to us under such license agreement to any of our affiliates or any third party, in each case, that directly or indirectly competes with the Ikaria nitric oxide business, and any future license agreements may contain similar restrictions. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates. The patents we have licensed from Ikaria relating to INOpulse\u2019s feature of providing delivery of nitric oxide to ensure a consistent dose over time expire as late as 2027 in the United States and as late as 2026 in certain other countries, as well as a patent with respect to the triple-lumen cannula that allows for safer and more accurate dosing of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide, which expires in 2033. The patents we have licensed from BioLine relating to our BCM product candidate expire as late as 2029 in the United States, with a possible patent term extension to 2032 to 2034, and 2024 in certain other countries.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, pursuant to our license agreement with Ikaria, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering the INOpulse technology that we license from Ikaria, except in the event that Ikaria declines to prosecute or maintain certain licensed patents that are core to our business, elects to allow any of such patents to lapse or elects to abandon any such patents, in which case we would have step-in rights to assume control of the prosecution and/or maintenance of such patents, subject to Ikaria\u2019s right to prohibit us from taking such actions if it reasonably determines that such actions could materially impair its business, operations or intellectual property rights. Similarly, under the terms of any future agreements that we may enter into with other third parties, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering the technology that is licensed to us under such agreements. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of non-U.S. countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, and in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents that protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or licensed issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and affect patent litigation. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act. Many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or licensed issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, we may be subject to third-party preissuance submissions of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our owned or licensed patent rights or the patent rights of others. For example, Notices of Opposition to two European patents covering BCM that we licensed from BioLine have been filed with the European Patent Office. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection\nprovided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. We may not receive patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act that we expect or our rights during the extension period may be more limited than the full scope of the patent, making it easier for our competitors to develop and market non-infringing technologies or products.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate, or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our owned or licensed patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file or participate in infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we or our licensors assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensor is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our owned or licensed patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.\nUnder the terms of our license agreement with Ikaria, in the event a third party is suspected of infringing any patent rights licensed to us by Ikaria, Ikaria has the initial right, but not the obligation, to initiate a legal action against such third party. In the event that Ikaria declines to take any action with respect to an alleged infringement of certain licensed patents that are core to our business, we have the right, in certain circumstances, to initiate a legal action against such third party, provided that, if Ikaria reasonably determines that our pursuit of any action with respect to infringement of any of such core patents could materially impair Ikaria\u2019s business operations or intellectual property rights, Ikaria may require us to not undertake or to cease any such action. Our inability to initiate a legal action against a third party suspected of infringing intellectual property rights important to our business may have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under license agreements, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to a license agreement with BioLine relating to our BCM product candidate that imposes, and we may enter into additional license agreements that may impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. Under our existing license agreement with BioLine, we are obligated to pay royalties on the net sales of product candidates or related technologies to the extent they are covered by the agreement. We also have diligence and development obligations under this agreement. Moreover, under our license agreement with Ikaria, we have granted Ikaria a sole and exclusive worldwide license to any intellectual property rights that we control for use in Ikaria\u2019s nitric oxide business, are required to ensure that all of our products, if any, are used solely for the chronic treatment of PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF and to enter into written agreements with any customers that contain restrictions on the use of our products and termination rights in the event such restrictions are violated, and have agreed to pay 100% of the reasonable and documented costs incurred by Ikaria for the prosecution and maintenance of certain licensed patents that are core to our business and 10% of such costs incurred by Ikaria for all other licensed patents. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future license agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product that is covered by the agreement or face other penalties under the agreement. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under any such agreement.\nFor example, BioLine recently indicated to us that it believed that we had breached our license agreement in several ways. We were able to reach agreement with BioLine and resolve the dispute through an amendment to the license agreement that includes a release of claims by BioLine. However, had we not been able to reach resolution and had BioLine brought and prevailed in a lawsuit against us, one of the potential remedies could have been the termination of the license agreement and our consequent loss of rights to BCM. Termination of our license agreement with BioLine, or any future license agreements we may enter into, or reduction or elimination of our rights under such agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. We may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in timely obtaining such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Even if timely obtained, such agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, in addition to paying monetary damages. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Even if we are successful in prosecuting such claims, any remedy awarded may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the improper disclosure or misappropriation. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7 Others may be able to develop and commercialize treatments that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7 We or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7 We or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u00b7 Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u00b7 It is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u00b7 Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u00b7 Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\u00b7 We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u00b7 The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u00b7 Another party may be granted orphan exclusivity for an indication that we are seeking before us or may be granted orphan exclusivity for one of our products for another indication.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. Our product candidates are in the early stages of development and are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug and device development. We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials, and in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party CROs to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience delays\nin obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nOur failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad, and any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States would not assure approval of product candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products and compliance with such requirements may involve substantial resources, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nEven if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or to conduct costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. In addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to ensure that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We and our contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP.\nAccordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to strict enforcement of post-marketing requirements and we could be subject to substantial penalties, including withdrawal of our product from the market, if we fail to comply with all regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to, restrictions governing promotion of an approved product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping.\nThe FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug and device products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs and devices in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws. Our failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:\n\u00b7 litigation involving patients taking our products;\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u00b7 restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u00b7 requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 untitled or warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 recall of products;\n\u00b7 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u00b7 damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u00b7 unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 product seizure; or\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNon-compliance by us or any future collaborator with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u00b7 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal government program, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7 the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7 the federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA, requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and\n\u00b7 analogous state laws and regulations such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and analogous non-U.S. fraud and abuse laws and regulations, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and non-U.S. laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain product candidates and products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nIf we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such third party in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the company, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the medical device industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing or selling certain product candidates and products outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nCurrently, we do not operate any research and development or production facilities, including laboratory, development or manufacturing facilities. However, if we decided to operate our own research and development and production facilities, we would be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Such operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we would not be able to eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use or disposal of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we would increase our level of workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not expect to maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our possible future storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are dependent on the scientific, business development and clinical expertise of our management team, including Jonathan Peacock, our chief executive officer, Manesh Naidu, our chief business officer, Reinilde Heyrman, our chief clinical development officer, and Martin Meglasson, our chief scientific officer. We recently hired our chief executive officer. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause some disruptions in our business.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. Any of our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately, to disclose unauthorized activities to us or to comply with our code of business conduct and ethics. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, false claims, inappropriate promotion, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIn addition, during the course of our operations, our directors, executives and employees may have access to material, non-public information regarding our business, our results of operations or potential transactions we are considering. We may not be able to prevent a director, executive or employee from violating our insider trading policies and trading in our common stock on the basis of, or while having access to, material, non-public information. If a director, executive or employee was to be investigated, or an action was to be brought against a director, executive or employee for insider trading, it could have a negative impact on our\nreputation and our stock price. Such a claim, with or without merit, could also result in substantial expenditures of time and money, and divert attention of our management team from other tasks important to the success of our business.\nWe expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 48 full-time employees, of which 41 employees were engaged in research and development. We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of development, regulatory affairs and, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders have substantial control over us, which could limit ability of our stockholders to influence the outcome of key transactions, including any change of control.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who are known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially owned 77.4% our outstanding common stock as of March 16, 2015. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to exert a significant degree of influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, could delay, defer or prevent a change in control; entrench our management or board of directors; or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.\nIn addition, as of March 16, 2015, our largest stockholder, investment funds affiliated with New Mountain Capital, or the New Mountain Entities, owned, in the aggregate, approximately 37.7% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement, the New Mountain Entities is entitled to designate one director for nomination to our board of directors and to designate one director to the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of each of our subsidiaries and to appoint the lead director of our board of directors, in each case, for so long as the New Mountain Entities or certain of their respective assignees beneficially own (i) 50% or more of the sum of (a) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that they collectively owned immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering and (b) the number of shares of our common stock, if any, acquired following the closing of our initial public offering and (ii) 15% or more of our common stock outstanding (as set forth on the cover of our then most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q).\nThe New Mountain Entities also have certain other rights conferred by the stockholders agreement. The New Mountain Entities may exert significant influence over matters requiring board approval. In addition, their consent is required for certain matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the compensation and hiring and firing of our chief executive officer, business combinations, issuance of shares of our capital stock and incurrence of debt. These stockholder approval rights will terminate when the New Mountain Entities own either (i) less than 50% of the sum of (a) the number of shares of our common stock that they collectively owned immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering and (b) the number of shares of our common stock,\nif any, acquired following the closing of our initial public offering or (ii) less than 15% of our common stock outstanding (as set forth on the cover of our then most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q).\nOur second largest stockholder, Linde North America, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Linde AG, or Linde, owned approximately 12.6% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement, Linde is entitled to designate one director to our board of directors and to designate one director to the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of each of our subsidiaries, in each case, for so long as Linde and/or certain of its assignees beneficially own (i) 50% or more of the sum of (a) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that they collectively owned immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering and (b) the number of shares of our common stock, if any, acquired following the closing of our initial public offering and (ii) 10% or more of our common stock outstanding (as set forth on the cover of our then most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q).\nThe New Mountain Entities and Linde may have interests that differ from the interests of our other stockholders, and they may vote in ways with which our other stockholders disagree and that may be adverse to interests of our other stockholders. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time, subject to certain restrictions described below. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of March 16, 2015, we had outstanding 12,905,392 shares of common stock. This includes the 5,000,000 shares that we sold in our initial public offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately without restriction, unless purchased by our affiliates. The remaining 7,905,392 shares currently are restricted as a result of securities laws or lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our initial public offering but will be able to be sold into the public market in the near future. Moreover, as of March 16, 2015, holders of an aggregate of approximately 8,733,628 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. In February 2015, we filed a registration statement registering all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. As of March 16, 2015, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 1,333,047 shares of our common stock, of which options to purchase approximately 689,906 were vested. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our initial public offering.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price or trading volume of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies, in part, on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If no, or few, analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their shares of common stock at or above the price they paid for their shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated results from and any delays in our clinical trials, including our expected and ongoing clinical trials of our INOpulse and BCM product candidates, as well as results of regulatory input on our clinical trial programs and regulatory reviews relating to the approval of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7 failure or discontinuation of any of our clinical development programs;\n\u00b7 the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u00b7 commencement or termination of any collaboration or licensing arrangement;\n\u00b7 disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and capital commitments;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 new products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors;\n\u00b7 general economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7 conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u00b7 sales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation often has been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nOur shares of common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market on February 13, 2015. Given the limited trading history of our common stock, there is a risk that an active trading market for our shares may not continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares, or at all.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents and may not use them effectively.\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of our cash and cash equivalents and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2020; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the first day of the year following the first year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe are currently incurring and expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a newly public company, we are incurring and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We expect that these expenses will further increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We expect that we will need to hire additional accounting, finance and other personnel to comply with the requirements of being a public company, and our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Overall, we estimate that our incremental costs resulting from operating as a public company may be between $2.0 million and $4.0 million per year, which costs are in addition to our expected incremental costs resulting from operating as a stand-alone company.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. We became a stand-alone company in February 2014 following the Spin-Out and, as such, have a very limited operating history. Accordingly, many of the internal controls over financial reporting have only recently been implemented and therefore have not been tested. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d will not apply to any of our stockholders or directors, except in limited circumstances, which may adversely affect our business or prospects.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d will not apply to any of our stockholders or directors, other than any stockholder or director that is an employee of ours. The doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers or directors from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation. We have renounced any prospective corporate opportunity so that our stockholders and directors (other than those that are employees of ours) and their respective representatives have no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, including any opportunity that becomes known to Ikaria and its directors, and have the right to either hold any corporate opportunity for its (and its representatives\u2019) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than us, including to Ikaria. As a result, our stockholders, directors and their respective affiliates will not be prohibited from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our customers. Therefore, we may be in competition with our stockholders, directors or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, a transaction that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively impact our business or prospects.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors or to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u00b7 a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u00b7 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u00b7 limitations on the ability of stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u00b7 limitations on the liability of, and the provision of indemnification to, our director and officers; and\n\u00b7 the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights similar to our common stock.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that investors could receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in an acquisition.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 15218, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "BLPH"}
