In this section, we describe what we believe are the material risks to our business and future development. This is not an exhaustive list of risks affecting our business. There may be other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial but turn out to be material in the future. If any of these risks were to materialize, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, reputation and growth prospects, and cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline substantially.\nInvestors should carefully consider the risk factors described below together with the other cautionary statements included in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe home hemodialysis market may not expand sufficiently to support our growth prospects.\nWhile we believe our largest growth opportunity with our existing products is within the home hemodialysis market, home hemodialysis therapies have not been extensively adopted. With our current technology, we believe that approximately 10-15% of end-stage renal disease patients in the U.S. would be appropriate candidates for home hemodialysis. However, only 2% of U.S. chronic dialysis patients receive hemodialysis treatments at home.\nOur growth requires that we continue to shift patients\u2019 and the medical community\u2019s understanding and view of home hemodialysis, and will require further increases in the number of patients who adopt home hemodialysis from current levels, physicians who are willing to prescribe home hemodialysis, and dialysis centers that are willing to support home hemodialysis growth. Most dialysis centers presently do not have the infrastructure to support a significant home hemodialysis patient population, including the availability of home hemodialysis training nurses, and may not be motivated to invest in home hemodialysis programs due, in part, to certain Medicare reimbursement policies. We will need to continue to devote significant resources to expanding the home hemodialysis market, but these efforts ultimately may not be successful.\nMedicare reimbursement policies may limit patient access to our home hemodialysis products.\nMedicare regulations that, directly or indirectly, have a disproportionate impact on home hemodialysis therapy may limit patient access to our home hemodialysis products. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented a prospective payment system for dialysis treatment. Under this prospective payment system, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services makes a single bundled payment to the dialysis center for each dialysis treatment that covers all renal dialysis services, inclusive of home dialysis and most drugs frequently administered to dialysis patients. This payment system replaced the former system which paid centers a composite rate for a defined set of items and services, while paying separately for drugs, laboratory tests, and other services that were not included in the composite rate. A stated goal of the new prospective payment system was to encourage home dialysis. To date, this reimbursement structure has not had a positive impact on the adoption of home or more frequent hemodialysis or the price of our products. However, the prospective payment system has had a significant positive impact on the adoption of peritoneal dialysis as evidenced by the significantly increased rates of training for peritoneal dialysis. We believe this increased focus on peritoneal dialysis growth and peritoneal dialysis training has been to the detriment of home hemodialysis training rates, as home training resources, including home training nurses in particular, have been more devoted to peritoneal dialysis training, leaving less time for home hemodialysis training.\nMedicare provides broad and well-established reimbursement in the U.S. for treating end-stage renal disease patients with hemodialysis three times a week. Most patients using the System One in the home, however, have been prescribed to dialyze more than three times per week to attain the clinical benefits of more frequent dialysis. Given the increased provider costs associated with providing more frequent dialysis, access to our home hemodialysis products will be impacted by whether dialysis centers receive or pursue adequate reimbursement for the additional dialysis treatments. Reimbursement for more frequent hemodialysis requires medical justification provided by the dialysis center based on information from the patient\u2019s physician, which increases the center\u2019s administrative burden. In addition, there is no national standard for what constitutes medical justification, thus reimbursement for more frequent hemodialysis varies due to differing Medicare contractor policies and center billing practices. Dialysis centers may be unwilling to support more frequent home hemodialysis in the absence of predictable Medicare reimbursement for additional treatments per week based on submitted claims for medical justification.\nCurrently, only four of the twelve Medicare contractor jurisdictions have issued formal local coverage determinations that describe medical justification for more frequent hemodialysis. In the remaining jurisdictions, medical justification is determined on a case-by-case basis. One Medicare contractor without such a local coverage determination, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, has issued a Medicare coverage article discussing considerations for hemodialysis frequency. Certain language in the coverage article is unclear or inconsistent with long-standing Medicare policy, including that reiterated in recent\nMedicare payment rules, but it may suggest a limitation to coverage of more frequent hemodialysis, even with medical justification. In partnership with other provider, patient, and professional organizations, we have actively engaged Noridian and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on this question. Many clinics have reported that they have continued to bill, and be paid for, additional treatments under this article; however, certain clinics have chosen at least at this time not to bill for more frequent dialysis sessions and this has impacted new patient access at those clinics. It remains unclear how this article will be implemented and what its impact will be in the long term.\nIn October 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued its final rule to update the payment policies and rates under the end-stage renal disease prospective payment system for 2017. Among other things, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services increased the home and self-dialysis training add-on payment and reiterated its policy of paying for appropriately medically justified hemodialysis treatments provided in excess of three treatments per week.\nMeasures to reduce healthcare costs may hurt our business.\nOur customers are healthcare providers who depend upon reimbursement by government and commercial insurance payors for dialysis treatments. With a vast majority of U.S. patients with end-stage renal disease covered by Medicare, the Medicare reimbursement rate is an important factor in a customer\u2019s decision to use the System One or our other products and limits the prices we may charge for our products. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued the 2017 final rule for the end-stage renal disease prospective payment system, which increases the base reimbursement rate less than 1% over 2016 rates. Commercial insurance payors may also exert downward pressure on payment rates for dialysis services. A reduction in reimbursement rates for dialysis treatments may adversely affect our customers\u2019 businesses and cause them to enact cost reduction measures that may include reducing the scope of their home hemodialysis programs.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services. For example, in 2010, comprehensive U.S. health care reform legislation was passed that had imposed a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of certain medical devices, including our products, which reduced our profitability. In December 2015, this tax was suspended for two years, but will continue to have a negative financial impact when it is imposed again starting in 2018, unless permanently suspended or repealed. Rising healthcare costs have also led many European and other foreign countries to adopt healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures, including government-imposed industry-wide price reductions, mandatory pricing systems, reference pricing systems, and payors limiting access to treatments based on cost-benefit analysis. Any of these measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments, as well as limit the prices we may charge for our products. During 2017, we face uncertainty regarding potential federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all provisions of recent U.S. health care reforms. Such changes may negatively impact our prospects for revenue growth, increase our costs or benefit our competitors. Absent additional clarity on the terms of any such changes, the impact on our business is uncertain.\nWe sell a limited number of products.\nWe derive most of our revenues from the sale or rental of the System One and the related products used with the System One, with the remainder of our revenues largely coming from the sale of a few key disposable products, including blood tubing sets and needles. Although we are working on initiatives that should diversify our future revenues, including a system for peritoneal dialysis and our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, our present business continues to be exposed to risks that are concentrated in a small number of products. As a result, any event that adversely affects these products or the markets for these products could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nOur relationships with DaVita and Fresenius are important to our business.\nDaVita and Fresenius collectively provide treatment to over two-thirds of U.S. dialysis patients and are our two largest customers. Sales to them have driven a large portion of our historical revenue growth. Any adverse change in either customer's ordering or clinical practices, including in response to the establishment of our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, would have an adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, these large dialysis providers have significant purchasing power, and we may be required to grant them favorable pricing and other terms for our products that reduce our gross margins and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur home market agreements with DaVita and Fresenius are intended to support the continued expansion of patient access to home hemodialysis with the System One, but like all our agreements with home customers, these agreements are not requirements contracts, and they contain no minimum purchase volumes. Our home market agreement with DaVita extends through December 31, 2018, with monthly renewals thereafter unless terminated by either party with 30 days' prior notice. Our home market agreement with Fresenius continues to renew on a monthly basis unless we and Fresenius choose to modify the terms with an amendment or new agreement.\nWe may be unable to achieve or sustain profitable operations.\nSince inception, we have incurred negative operating margins and losses every quarter. Currently, we have a significant accumulated deficit. Although we are working towards achieving positive net income for the full 2017 fiscal year, we continue to invest in our operations, in particular with respect to our product pipeline and NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, to drive future growth. Accordingly, we cannot ensure the extent or sustainability of our future profitability.\nOur NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers introduce significant new risks to our business.\nAs health care providers and participants in federal health care programs, our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers must comply with complex regulations that are, in some instances, new to our business, including:\n\u2022\nMedicare and Medicaid payment rules, including coverage rules that limit the clinical circumstances under which payment will be made for more frequent dialysis treatments;\n\u2022\nanti-kickback and related laws prohibiting payments and other remuneration intended to influence the referral of health care business or selection of a provider;\n\u2022\nprohibitions on submitting false claims for government or commercial insurance reimbursement;\n\u2022\nlaws regulating the use and disclosure of patient health information; and\n\u2022\nlaws regulating the storage and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\nIf we violate such laws and regulations, we may face criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. If we are found to have submitted improper claims for reimbursement to the government or commercial insurers, we may also have to repay amounts received from government or commercial payors and pay additional damages and interest.\nJoint ventures have become common vehicles within the dialysis services industry and are designed to improve the quality of care while managing healthcare costs by sharing clinical expertise, management experience and industry knowledge in an efficient manner. A few of our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers are structured as joint ventures in which physicians hold an interest. These physician owners may also provide medical director services and refer patients to our dialysis centers. There has been growing governmental scrutiny of joint ventures and other financial arrangements with physicians or physician groups. Although we seek to structure our joint ventures in compliance with all regulatory requirements, the applicable laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied in specific circumstances. Regulatory authorities may challenge our joint ventures on the grounds that they are intended to induce patient referrals and, if successful, may require that we restructure or terminate our joint ventures, repay to Medicare amounts received by them pursuant to any prohibited referrals and incur the types of penalties described in the preceding paragraph.\nOur NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers must maintain enrollment in the Medicare program in order to bill and receive payment for dialysis services provided to patients covered by Medicare and certain private insurers. Medicare enrollment requires, among other things, that a center successfully complete a certification process conducted by individual state agencies on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and that certification requirements be met on an ongoing basis. Our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers may be unable to obtain Medicare certification in a timely manner, if at all, or could lose certification upon resurvey if they are found to not meet applicable requirements.\nOur NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers provide us with valuable experience to better meet and anticipate the needs of both our customers and patients, and optimize our product technology. Our customers may, however, perceive these centers to be directly competing with their business which could, and may have already, negatively impact product sales.\nWe face competition from many sources.\nThe dialysis therapy market is mature and we face competition from many sources, including those that are listed in the section of this report entitled \u201cBusiness - Our Competition.\u201d Our competitors may have significant competitive advantages by:\n\u2022\noffering products and services that are more widely recognized by physicians, patients and providers;\n\u2022\noffering broader product lines which enable them to offer a broader bundle of products;\n\u2022\nhaving significantly more financial and human resources, more established service and customer support infrastructures and spending more on product development and marketing;\n\u2022\nhaving more established sales forces and distribution channels; and\n\u2022\nhaving more established relationships with the providers of dialysis therapy, including Fresenius which is the world\u2019s largest provider of dialysis services and products and may at any time reduce its promotion of our dialysis products to its dialysis patients in favor of other, including its own, dialysis products.\nFurther consolidation within the highly competitive dialysis industry may exacerbate these risks.\nOur in-center business is increasingly subject to pricing and other competitive pressures within the highly consolidated U.S. dialysis services industry. A meaningful portion of that business was lost when our needle purchase agreement with DaVita expired in December 2014, and we experienced reduced demand for our blood tubing sets from Baxter during 2016. While we believe our in-center products offer benefits over competing products, our customers often regard blood tubing sets and needles as commodities, and we are vulnerable to large changes in purchasing patterns for these products. Unless we can successfully demonstrate to customers the differentiating features of our blood tubing sets and needles, we may continue to be susceptible to pressures to reduce our product pricing and more vulnerable to reduction in sales of our blood tubing sets and needles.\nAs we attain greater commercial success, our competitors are likely to develop products that offer features and functionality similar to the System One and our other products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introduction of new competitive products may make it more difficult for us to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better reliability, convenience or effectiveness or are offered at lower prices.\nThe development of viable medical, pharmacological and technological advances in treating or preventing kidney failure may also limit the market for our products and services. While kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal disease, it is not currently a viable treatment for most patients due to the limited number of donor kidneys, the high incidence of kidney transplant rejection and the higher surgical risk associated with older patients. This may change, however, with the development of new medications designed to reduce the incidence of kidney transplant rejection, progress in using kidneys harvested from genetically engineered animals as a source of transplants and other advances in kidney transplantation.\nWe need to maintain strong product reliability to grow our business.\nWe need to maintain strong reliability for our existing products to achieve our growth and profitability objectives. Poor product reliability could lead to customer dissatisfaction, adversely affect our reputation and revenues, and increase our service and distribution costs and working capital requirements. We also need to establish strong product reliability for all new products we offer. With new products, we are more exposed to risks relating to product quality and reliability until the manufacturing processes for these new products mature. From time to time, we may transition the manufacturing and supply of products and components to different suppliers or locations. As we make these changes, we are more exposed to risks relating to product quality and reliability until the manufacturing processes mature. Like all transitions of this nature, they could increase our costs in the near term.\nWe need to develop and commercialize new products to grow our business.\nOur future growth requires that we develop and commercialize new products in a timely manner to address changing market requirements, such as our peritoneal dialysis system and next-generation critical care system. Otherwise, we may lose revenues or market share to our competitors, which may be difficult to regain. Developing innovative products and bringing them to market is a highly costly, lengthy and uncertain process, and we may experience delays in commercializing new products. Our efforts may not produce commercially viable products due to the many technological, regulatory, operational and other risks associated with product development, including:\n\u2022\nthe new product may not perform as intended or may have safety concerns;\n\u2022\nthe FDA and other regulatory authorities may not approve the new product or the facilities in which it is manufactured in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\npayors may not reimburse the new product sufficiently or at all;\n\u2022\ncompeting products may be safer, more effective or easier to use;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of the new product for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-effective manner; and\n\u2022\nmarket demand for the new product may fall below expectations.\nGeneral economic and financial market conditions may exacerbate our business risks.\nGlobal macro-economic conditions and the world's financial markets remain susceptible to significant stresses, resulting in reductions in available credit and government spending, economic downturn or stagnation, foreign currency fluctuations and volatility in the valuations of securities generally. Our customers and distributors may respond to such economic pressures by reducing or deferring their capital spending or reducing staff. As a result, they may choose to rent rather than purchase our equipment or enter into other less-capital intensive purchase structures with us, which may reduce our cash flows, and have fewer personnel available to train new patients for home hemodialysis. Our international business is particularly vulnerable to global macro economic conditions. Furthermore, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar could increase our product costs, reducing our gross profit, or render our products overly expensive, reducing our revenues.\nWe may not effectively manage our growth.\nOur business growth will strain our administrative and operational infrastructure unless we:\n\u2022\nincrease our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand;\n\u2022\nexpand our sales and marketing and on-going development capabilities;\n\u2022\nimprove our information technology infrastructure, operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022\nmanage the increased complexity and scope of our relationships with various partners, distributors, suppliers, manufacturers and other organizations.\nWe may be unable to implement such changes in an efficient and timely manner, and in the process of expansion may discover deficiencies in our existing systems and controls.\nWe need to effectively manage our field equipment.\nOur home market relies upon an equipment service swap model and, for some of our customers, an equipment rental model that requires us to effectively manage our System One and PureFlow SL field equipment. While a majority of our home market customers currently purchase, rather than rent, our equipment, this may change due to pressures within the healthcare industry to reduce capital spending and other factors. Increases in our rental or service swap equipment would increase our ongoing cash requirements to fund working capital. In addition, our gross margins may be negatively impacted if we have excess equipment deployed and unused in the field. If we are unable to successfully track, service and redeploy equipment, we could incur increased costs, realize increased cash requirements and have material write-offs of equipment. This would negatively impact our working capital requirements and future profitability.\nWe may be subject to litigation claims from time to time.\nFrom time to time, we are threatened with individual actions involving our business, including without limitation products liability, employment, intellectual property, commercial and tort claims. The manufacture and marketing of medical devices, in particular, has an attendant risk of product liability claims. If any of our employees or products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. Any claims made against us could adversely affect our reputation and damage our position in the market. Claims can also be time consuming, distracting and expensive to defend and could result in a diversion of management and financial resources away from our primary business, in which case our business may suffer. Any investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation and divert management time and attention from operating our business. While we maintain insurance at levels deemed adequate by management, future claims may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by any insurance.\nAcquiring or developing businesses, technologies or products may present new challenges.\nIn the course of evaluating growth opportunities, we may acquire or develop businesses, technologies or products, as we did in 2007 with the acquisition of Medisystems and in 2013 with the introduction of our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers. We may also devote resources to potential acquisitions that are never completed or may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with any growth or change in business lines or strategy that may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of such opportunities or adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nneed for significant investment without assurance of success;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nneed for involvement of senior management to develop the acquired businesses, technologies or products, which will take away from the time they ordinarily spend on the remainder of our business;\n\u2022\nentry into markets or types of businesses in which we have limited experience;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key partners, customers or suppliers of ours or any acquired business;\n\u2022\naddition of new complex compliance obligations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing geographically remote units both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in successfully implementing, upgrading and deploying in a timely and effective manner new operational information systems and upgrades of our finance, accounting and product distribution systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development projects and technology integration;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations and personnel of an acquired businesses, including with respect to differing and complex accounting and financial reporting systems;\n\u2022\ncustomers delaying purchases of our products pending resolution of product integration between our existing and our newly acquired products;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees of an acquired company; and\n\u2022\ninaccurate assumptions of an acquired company's product or service quality.\nFurther, any acquired technology or product may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All technology and product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of medical device product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities.\nWe have international operations that introduce a number of risks and uncertainties.\nSubstantially all of our manufacturing is done outside the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Germany, Italy and Mexico, and purchase components, products and supplies from foreign vendors. We also sell our products internationally. We are subject to a number of risks and challenges that specifically relate to these international operations, including:\n\u2022\nforeign exchange risk, in particular with respect to the euro and peso, which could adversely affect our financial results and our ability to maintain mutually beneficial and profitable relationships with foreign vendors, distributors and customers, and increase our costs to attract and retain international personnel;\n\u2022\nexpropriation and other restrictive government actions;\n\u2022\nchanges in intellectual property legal protections and remedies;\n\u2022\ncosts and challenges associated with sourcing and shipping goods internationally and importing and exporting goods;\n\u2022\nchanges to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including enactment of tariffs or border-adjusted taxes on goods imported into the U.S.;\n\u2022\ndifficulty managing operations in multiple locations;\n\u2022\nlocal regulations that may restrict or impair our ability to conduct our operations, increase compliance costs, and make it more expensive and complex to manage our workforce;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nhealth issues, such as pandemic disease risk, and natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and earthquakes, which could disrupt our manufacturing and logistical and import activities; and\n\u2022\nin certain locations, risks associated with local instability, including threats of violence, which could lead to disruptions in supply at our manufacturing facilities or key vendors.\nThese risks and uncertainties may materially impact our growth strategy in these markets and overall operating profits. Risks associated with our international operations may increase where we sell our products and services directly rather than through distributors, as we do in the United Kingdom and Canada.\nDuring June 2016, the referendum by UK voters to exit the European Union (\"Brexit\") adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a sharp decline of the British pound sterling against our reporting currency, the US dollar. Continued volatility in or devaluation of the British pound sterling may adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our reported international sales and earnings and causing our UK customers to reduce their investment in healthcare. The further impact of Brexit on our international business will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to EU markets. Although it is unknown what the terms of the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU will be, the imposition of greater restrictions on imports\nand exports between the UK and EU countries and an increase in regulatory complexity could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees in the UK.\nOur In-Center and international businesses rely heavily upon third-party distributors.\nSubstantially all of our blood tubing sets and needles are sold through distributors. We also use distributors to sell our products in most of our international markets. Relying on third-party distributors exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, compliance risks, credit risk and concentration. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may be unable to motivate them to focus their efforts on selling our products. The trend toward consolidation among distributors may yield greater purchasing leverage, which may increase the pricing pressures facing our business. If our distributors fail to comply with applicable laws in the sale and marketing of our products or fulfill any other responsibilities they may have, our revenues may decline and we may become involved in legal proceedings. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Moving any of this business to other distributors would involve switching costs that may be material in the near term.\nWe rely on the expertise of a concentrated group of employees.\nOur success depends upon the skills, experience and efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel, including our research and development and manufacturing executives and managers. Much of our expertise is concentrated in relatively few employees, the loss of whom for any reason could negatively affect our business. Competition for our highly skilled employees is intense, and we cannot prevent the future resignation of any employee.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nOur products and business are subject to extensive regulation.\nWe need regulatory approvals to market new products and, in some cases, modifications to existing marketed products. Regulatory approval pathways for medical devices are complex, time consuming and difficult to define, and they may become more onerous through additional regulation. We may be unable to obtain the necessary approvals to market our new products and modifications to marketed products in a timely manner, if at all. Foreign markets are particularly challenging as the regulatory approval procedure varies from country to country and requires that we comply with numerous regulatory requirements that differ from the FDA approval process and are not superseded by obtaining approval from the FDA or another country's regulatory authority. As these regulatory requirements become increasingly more stringent, it may become more difficult and costly for us to expand into new markets. In certain foreign markets, some of our products are classified as drugs rather than medical devices, which require us to demonstrate compliance with separate regulations applicable to drug manufacturers and distributors. These complex regulations may impose additional approval, manufacturing, surveillance and reporting requirements. Compliance with these additional requirements may increase our costs of doing business in new foreign markets and delay or prevent our entry into such markets.\nFollowing marketing approval, we must comply with numerous ongoing regulatory requirements and industry codes of conduct and consensus standards, including those described in the section of this report entitled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d Noncompliance with applicable regulations can result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nviolation letters;\n\u2022\nfines, injunctions, and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of products;\n\u2022\nadministrative detention, which is the detention by regulatory authorities of medical devices believed to be adulterated or misbranded;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nfailure of the government to grant pre-market clearance or pre-market approval for devices;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nSuch enforcement measures would require unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions and may adversely affect our business.\nNew regulations, codes and standards are periodically adopted which may require us to change our existing product technologies, operating procedures or marketing practices in order to continue selling our products. In addition, regulatory authorities have been increasingly aggressive in their enforcement activities and scrutiny of medical device and healthcare companies. Any of these factors may expose us to increased compliance costs and the assessment of significant fines, as well\nas risks that we may be unable to satisfy the new regulations, codes or standards, or more expansive interpretations of existing regulations and have to suspend, curtail or otherwise modify our selling and marketing efforts and other aspects of our operations.\nOur products may be recalled from the market.\nMedical devices can experience performance problems in the field that require review and possible corrective action. The occurrence of component failures, manufacturing errors, software errors, design defects or labeling inadequacies affecting a medical device could lead to a government-mandated or voluntary recall by the device manufacturer, in particular when such deficiencies may endanger health. From time to time we have chosen to voluntarily recall certain products that we believed were mislabeled or otherwise defective. Product recalls may materially divert management attention and financial resources, expose us to product liability or other claims, harm our reputation with customers and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe need to protect the privacy of patient health and other personal information.\nIn the course of performing our business we obtain, from time to time, confidential patient health information and other personal information. Federal and state laws, as well as the laws of foreign countries, protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, in particular individually identifiable information and other personal information, and restrict the use and disclosure of that information. A description of these laws is included in the section of this report entitled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Privacy and Security.\u201d Complying with the privacy and security requirements of such laws imposes compliance related costs, subjects us to potential regulatory audits and may restrict our business operations. These various laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating potentially complex compliance issues for our business. If we were to violate any of our legal obligations to safeguard any confidential patient health or other personal information against improper use and disclosure, we could lose customers and be exposed to liability, including potential civil and criminal penalties and contractual liabilities, and our reputation and business could be harmed. Concerns or allegations about our practices with regard to the privacy or security of personal health information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nWe must comply with fraud and abuse laws.\nVarious federal and state laws, as well as the laws of foreign countries, prohibit payments to induce the referral of healthcare products or services and require medical device companies to monitor and report certain payments to health care professionals. These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users, including patients, of medical devices and services. They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us. In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales and rental offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs and physician consulting and other service arrangements. For our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, they also affect our arrangements with any joint venture partners in a position to refer patients, our medical directors and our patient billing and collection practices. If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase, order or use our products or services, or to refer patients to our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal patient inducement prohibition or similar state laws. If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws. A shifting and diverse regulatory environment increases the associated compliance risks since different jurisdictions may have different reporting requirements.\nOther federal and state laws, as well as the laws of foreign countries, generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to government or commercial payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Medical device manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities. In addition, our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers are directly subject to these laws with respect to the reimbursement claims they file with government payors. Potential false or fraudulent claim risk can arise from promoting and billing for services the government deems excessive or not medically necessary, as well as from other billing improprieties and from failure to timely return any identified overpayments. We attempt to ensure that billing by our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers is proper and that physicians who order NxStage Kidney Care dialysis services document medical need for patients for whom more frequent than thrice weekly therapy is ordered. Nevertheless, the government may not regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent and may examine our role in providing information to our customers, physicians and patients concerning the benefits and potential coverage of more frequent therapy. Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, patients or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws. False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial, and raise the possibility of exclusion from participation in government\nhealth care programs, potentially crippling to the line of business involved. Moreover, any investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and require a costly and time consuming response.\nForeign governments tend to impose strict price controls.\nWe market the System One and certain of our other products internationally. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of medical devices is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after a device has been CE marked. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to supply data that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, it may not be profitable to sell our products outside of the United States, which would negatively affect the long-term growth of our business. Furthermore, reimbursement provided for our products in other jurisdictions could change, positively or negatively. If reimbursements were to be negatively changed, such as in the United Kingdom or Canada where we sell our products directly, our ability to profitably sell our products could be impaired.\nWe must comply with import and export laws and regulations.\nWe import into the United States disposable medical supplies from our manufacturing facilities and vendors located outside the United States. We have manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Germany and Italy and export various components and assemblies related to those operations. To a lesser but increasing degree, we also export finished goods from the United States to foreign countries. The import and export of these items are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, or fail to interpret our obligations accurately, we may be subject to significant fines, liabilities, import holds and a disruption in our ability to deliver product. The U.S. federal government has called for substantial changes to trade, fiscal and tax policies which may include comprehensive tax reform and changes to existing trade agreements, including but not limited to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Changes to capital and exchange controls, expropriation or other restrictive government actions could adversely affect our business. We also are subject to changes in tax and tariff regulations, both domestically and abroad that could increase our costs and reduce our margins. If there are modifications to the Generalized System of Preferences or cancellation of the Nairobi Protocol tariff classifications that apply to our products such that our products would be subject to duties, or if the United States imposes tariffs or border-adjusted taxes on imports to the United States of goods manufactured outside the United States, our expenses could increase and our profitability may be negatively impacted.\nWe must comply with anti-bribery laws.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls, including at foreign controlled subsidiaries. Through our international activities, we are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act and other similar anti-bribery laws in other countries. While we have policies and procedures in place designed to promote compliance with such laws, our employees or other agents may nonetheless engage in prohibited conduct under these laws for which we or our executives might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with environmental and occupational safety laws.\nOur research and development programs as well as our manufacturing operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, and our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers produce medical waste in connection with providing dialysis services. Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, as well as the laws of foreign countries, governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials. In the event of an accident or failure to comply with environmental or occupational safety laws, we could be held liable for resulting damages, and any such liability could exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business may be affected by U.S. government contracting risks.\nWe have agreements with Veterans Health Administration facilities and are one of the key subcontractors on a government contract to develop a portable medical device to treat sepsis. As a result, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts which, among other things, impose additional costs on our business. If we violate any of these laws or regulations, we may be liable for fines, penalties and any additional costs the government incurs in procuring replacement services, and we may be excluded from future U.S. government contracting.\nRisks Related to Operations\nWe obtain some of our raw materials and production services from a single source.\nWe depend upon a number of single-source suppliers for certain of our raw materials, components and finished goods, including the fiber used in our System One filters, our needles and sterile bags, as well as sterilization services. Some of our most critical single-source supply relationships are with Membrana and Laboratorios PiSA.\nMembrana is our only supplier of the fiber used in our filters for System One products under an agreement that expires in December 2023, and contractually we cannot obtain an alternative source of fiber for our System One products. While our relationship with Asahi could afford us back-up supply in the event of supply disruptions at Membrana, we do not have the regulatory approvals necessary to use Asahi fiber in our System One cartridge in the United States, and the performance of Asahi fiber in our System One has not yet been validated.\nLaboratorios PiSA supplies substantially all of our premixed dialysate. Our supply agreement with Laboratorios PiSA extends through December 2019. We have committed to purchase from Laboratorios PiSA a minimum quantity of premixed dialysate over the term of the agreement. While we purchase premixed dialysate from another qualified supplier, any significant disruption in Laboratorios PiSA\u2019s ability to supply premixed dialysate to us would impair our business, at least in the near term.\nOur dependence upon these and other single-source suppliers of raw materials, components, finished goods and sterilization services exposes us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases, late deliveries and an inability to meet customer demand. This could lead to customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or customers switching to competitive products. Any interruption in supply could be particularly damaging to our customers using the System One to treat chronic end-stage renal disease who need access to the System One and related disposables to continue their therapy.\nFinding alternative sources for these raw materials, components, finished goods and sterilization services would be difficult and in many cases entail a significant amount of time, disruption and cost. Although we believe our supply chain has sufficient inventory of raw materials, components and finished goods to withstand a temporary disruption in supply from any single source supplier, any permanent or long-term disruption in supply from any single source supplier could lead to supply delays or interruptions which would damage our business and impair our reputation, at least in the near term.\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts with many of our third-party suppliers.\nWe purchase raw materials and components from third-party suppliers, including some single-source suppliers, through purchase orders and do not have long-term supply contracts with many of our suppliers. Many of our suppliers are not obligated to perform services or supply products for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. We do not maintain large volumes of inventory from most of our suppliers. If we inaccurately forecast demand for finished goods, we may be unable to meet customer demand which could harm our competitive position and reputation. In addition, if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with our suppliers, we may be required to change suppliers, which may be time consuming and lead to disruptions in our product supply.\nWe may experience manufacturing disruptions.\nWe rely on our manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Italy and Germany for the production of our equipment and disposables. The loss of any of these facilities due to fire, natural disaster, war, power failure or other cause beyond our control could cause significant production delays, prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products, increase our product costs, impair our product quality or reliability and result in substantially decreased revenues.\nWhile we have labor agreements with our production employees in Mexico and Italy, we may experience strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns, grievances, complaints, claims of unfair labor practices, other collective bargaining disputes or other labor disputes at our manufacturing facilities. Some of our key single-source suppliers also have labor agreements in place but nonetheless may be subject to similar risks related to labor disputes. Any such activity likely would cause production delays and prevent us from delivering our production commitments to customers, which could adversely affect our reputation and cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nCommodity price increases may adversely affect our financial results.\nResin is a key material in the manufacture of our products, including the System One cartridge. We currently source resin from a small number of suppliers. Periods of rising prices for crude oil, natural gas and other petrochemical intermediates from which resin is produced have resulted in significant price increases for this material, and similar periods of rising resin prices may occur in the future. Our contracts with customers restrict our ability to immediately pass on these price increases, and future pricing to customers may be insufficient to accommodate increasing resin costs. In addition, our overall cost reduction plans may not sufficiently offset the impact of increased resin costs, which could result in declining margins and operating results.\nWe currently incur significant inbound and outbound distribution costs, which are dependent upon fuel prices. Increases in fuel prices could lead to increases in our distribution costs, which could impair our ability to achieve profitability.\nOur business is dependent upon the security and uninterrupted operation of our information technology infrastructure.\nWe rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information, including confidential patient health information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties and are highly interconnected, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of installing, upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. In addition, these systems can require significant resources to ensure their continuous operation. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we may be subject to material remediation expenses, reputational harm and litigation.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe have to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our proprietary technology and prevent others from duplicating our products. However, these means may afford only limited protection and may not:\n\u2022\nprevent our competitors from duplicating our products;\n\u2022\nprevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology; or\n\u2022\npermit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.\nThese risks may increase in foreign countries whose laws do not protect intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as U.S. laws.\nAny of our patents, including those we may license, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented. We may not prevail if our patents are challenged by competitors or other third parties. The U.S. federal courts or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents, find them unenforceable or narrow their scope. Furthermore, competitors may be able to design around our patents, or obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods for treating kidney failure. If these developments were to occur, our products may become less competitive, and sales of our products may decline.\nWe have filed numerous patent applications seeking protection of products and other inventions originating from our research and development. Our patent applications may not result in an issued patent, and any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies.\nOur products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patent infringement and intellectual property rights. Products to provide kidney replacement therapy have been available for more than 50 years, and our competitors hold a significant number of patents relating to kidney replacement devices, therapies, products and supplies. Competitors and other third parties may allege that our products or methods infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, and the possibility of such infringement claims may increase as our business expands into new markets.\nInfringement and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and harm to our reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also divert management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of the business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenues;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and which could reduce profitability; and\n\u2022\nredesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not be possible and could be costly and time consuming, if it is possible to do so.\nDisclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information may harm our business.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, advisors and others. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover or reverse engineer trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we may be unable to assert any trade secret rights against such party. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nMany of our employees have worked at other medical device companies focused on the development of dialysis products, including our competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and harm to our reputation and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThere may be periods of volatility in the market price of our common stock that delay or prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you paid for it. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\ntiming of market launch and market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\ntiming of achieving profitability from operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts or the failure to meet or exceed securities analysts' expectations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nfuture debt or equity financings;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes with key vendors or customers, or adverse changes to the purchasing patterns of key customers and distributors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in product supply for any reason, our failure to appropriately forecast supply or demand, difficulties in moving products across international borders, or the failure of third party suppliers to produce needed products or components;\n\u2022\nreports by officials or health, medical or regulatory authorities or the general media regarding the potential benefits of the System One, similar dialysis products distributed by other companies or more frequent or home dialysis;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures to obtain marketing approval for new products or modifications to marketed products;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls and withdrawals;\n\u2022\ndefaults under our material contracts, including without limitation our credit agreement;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in third-party healthcare reimbursements, particularly a decline in the level of Medicare reimbursement for dialysis treatments, or the willingness of Medicare contractors to pay for more than three treatments a week where medically justified;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes that could affect our profitability, such as the imposition of import tariffs and border-adjusted taxes;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our company or our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technical innovations or new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture and supply our products to commercial standards;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninvestors' general perception of our company, our products, the economy and general market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other risks and uncertainties described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Periods of volatility in the market price of our securities may engender class action securities litigation against us. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nProvisions in our governing documents and under Delaware law may discourage potential acquisition proposals and changes in management that stockholders may favor.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws and under the corporation law of Delaware, where we are incorporated, may delay or prevent a takeover attempt that could be viewed as beneficial to stockholders who wish to receive a premium for their shares from a potential bidder. These provisions may also discourage stockholders from attempting to replace or remove members of our board of directors, which in turn may delay or prevent changes in our current management team that stockholders may favor. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cshareholders rights plan\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations of directors or stockholder proposals;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that board vacancies be filled by a majority of our directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nIf we obtain additional financing for acquisitions and other growth initiatives, it may reduce the market value of our common shares.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire other businesses and technologies and pursue additional business opportunities. To finance such activity, we may issue equity securities, which may dilute our existing stockholders, and incur debt, which may place restrictions on our business operations. Such financing activity may reduce the market value of our common shares and other securities, in particular if the initiatives being funded are not viewed favorably by our stockholders or are ultimately unsuccessful. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, particularly in light of the volatility in the financial markets and the valuations of securities generally.", "PERMNO": 90957, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "NXTM"}
