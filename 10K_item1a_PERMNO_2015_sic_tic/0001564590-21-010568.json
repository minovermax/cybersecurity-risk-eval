{"cik": "877422", "company": "SpartanNash Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company faces many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations may suffer, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline. This discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of these forward-looking statements are affected by the risk factors discussed in this item and this discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with the discussion of forward-looking statements, which appears at the beginning of this report.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe Company operates in an extremely competitive industry. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors are much larger and may be able to compete more effectively.\nThe Company\u2019s Food Distribution and Retail segments have many competitors, including regional and national grocery distributors, large chain stores that have integrated wholesale and retail operations, mass merchandisers, e-commerce providers, deep discount retailers, limited assortment stores and wholesale membership clubs. The Company\u2019s Military segment faces competition from large national and regional food distributors and smaller distributors. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater resources than the Company.\nIndustry consolidation, alternative store formats, nontraditional competitors and e-commerce have contributed to market share losses for traditional grocery stores. The Company\u2019s Food Distribution, Military and Retail segments are primarily focused on traditional retail grocery trade, which faces competition from faster growing alternative retail channels, such as dollar stores, discount supermarket chains, Internet-based retailers and meal-delivery services. The Company expects these trends to continue. If the Company is not successful in competing with these alternative channels, or growing sales into such channels, its business or financial results may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company faces competitive pressures from e-commerce activity, as consumers continue to adopt this format and do more of their shopping online. While the Company offers e-commerce services at many of its stores, some of its stores and many of its independent retailer customers do not. Other e-commerce providers may offer lower prices, superior online ordering or delivery service, or greater convenience than the Company. If the Company fails to compete successfully, it could face lower sales and may decide or be compelled to offer greater discounts to its customers, which could result in decreased profitability.\nDisease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial results.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, national, state, and local authorities recommended social distancing and imposed quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. While these measures were designed to protect the overall public health, they had material adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and have resulted in the United States entering a period of recession.\nWhile the Company is an essential business and has seen significant increases in sales volume during the pandemic, its business may be negatively impacted by several factors associated with the pandemic and any future disease outbreak and the related effects on the retail grocery and wholesale distribution industries. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by the Company have included, and may continue to include the following impacts, which may also be characteristic of future potential disease outbreaks:\n\u2022\nIncreased costs due to significant increases in customer traffic and demand for grocery products, and the corresponding inability to meet demand with the existing workforce or other assets;\n\u2022\nFailure of third parties on which the Company relies, including its customers, suppliers, contractors, commercial banks and other business partners to meet their obligations to the Company, which may be caused by their own financial or operational challenges;\n\u2022\nSupply chain risks due to significantly increased demand, including the availability of warehouse and transportation personnel and service providers or the inability to procure adequate quantities of certain goods;\n\u2022\nReduced workforce or temporary store and distribution center closures associated with the presence of COVID-19 infections among the Company\u2019s associates;\n\u2022\nIncreased costs relating to compliance with public health and safety requirements for the Company\u2019s associates and customers, including the purchase of personal protective equipment, cleaning and sanitization of retail and distribution facilities and construction and remodeling costs related to maintaining effective social distancing barriers;\n\u2022\nInability to accurately forecast financial results due to the uncertainty associated with the short- and long-term effects on the U.S. economy, consumer behavior and the unknown duration of social distancing, quarantine or isolation measures or the lasting effects that may result after such mandates have been removed; or\n\u2022\nIncreased and accelerated competition from alternative channels, including e-commerce retailers, due to a change in consumer behavior and continued social distancing.\n\u2022\nClosure or access restrictions at retail stores or military commissaries, which limit the consumer\u2019s access to the products the Company sells and distributes, which negatively impact sales volumes.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, may materially increase costs, negatively impact sales and damage the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and its liquidity position. The significance and duration of any such impacts are not possible to predict due to the overall uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and any future pandemic.\nThe private brand program for U.S. military commissaries may not achieve the desired results.\nIn December 2016, DeCA, which operates U.S. military commissaries worldwide, competitively awarded to the Company the contract to support and supply products for the Agency\u2019s private brand product program. Private brand products had not previously been offered in the Agency\u2019s commissaries. The Company has invested and will continue to invest significant resources as it partners with DeCA to continue to expand the program, however there is no guarantee of its success, that the program will continue or that DeCA will continue to partner with SpartanNash. The Company expects that DeCA will face significant competition in each product category from national brands that are familiar to consumers. If the Agency is unable to drive traffic and business at the commissaries by offering one-stop shopping for military customers through a combination of both national and private brand offerings, then both DeCA and the Company may be unable to achieve expected returns from this program, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The success of the program will depend, in part, on factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the actions of the Agency. While the current contract with DeCA expires in December 2021, the Company hopes to continue the relationship, although there cannot be a guarantee of renewal.\nThe Company may not be able to implement its strategy of growth through acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nPart of the Company\u2019s growth strategy involves selected acquisitions of additional distribution operations, and to a lesser extent, retail grocery stores. Given the recent consolidation activity and limited number of potential acquisition targets within the food industry, the Company may not be able to identify suitable targets for acquisition and may make acquisitions which do not achieve the desired level of profitability or sales. Additionally, future acquisitions of retail grocery stores could result in the Company competing with its independent retailer customers and could adversely affect existing business relationships with those customers. As a result, the Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, complete acquisitions or obtain the necessary financing and this may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow profitably. If the Company fails to successfully integrate business acquisitions and realize planned synergies, the business may not perform to expectations.\nSubstantial operating losses may occur if the customers to whom the Company extends credit or for whom the Company guarantees loans or lease obligations fail to repay the Company.\nFrom time to time, the Company may advance funds, extend credit and lend money to certain independent retailers and guarantee loan or lease obligations of certain customers. The Company seeks to obtain security interest and other credit support in connection with these arrangements, but the collateral may not be sufficient to cover the Company\u2019s exposure. Greater than expected losses from existing or future credit extensions, loans, guarantee commitments or sublease arrangements could negatively and materially impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales are with major customers and the Company\u2019s success may be dependent on retaining this business and its customers\u2019 ability to grow their business.\nThe Company\u2019s customer base includes certain large and growing customers. To the extent that major customers decide to utilize alternative sources of products, whether through other distributors or self-distribution, the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Similarly, if major customers are not able to grow their business, the Company may be materially and adversely affected.\nSales to one of the Company\u2019s customers accounted for more than 15% of the Company\u2019s net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain a close, mutually beneficial relationship with major customers is an important determinant of the Company\u2019s continued growth.\nChanges in relationships with the Company\u2019s vendor base may adversely affect its business, margins, and profitability.\nThe Company sources the products it sells from a wide variety of vendors. The Company generally does not have long-term written contracts with its major suppliers that would require them to continue supplying merchandise. The Company depends on its vendors for appropriate allocation of merchandise, assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within its stores, and funding for various forms of promotional allowances. There has been significant consolidation in the food industry, and this consolidation may continue to the Company\u2019s commercial disadvantage. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems, including security breaches and cyber-attacks, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has complex information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems that are important to its business operations. It also employs mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with customers, associates, suppliers, and business partners. The Company receives, transmits, and stores many types of sensitive information, including consumers\u2019 personal information, information belonging to vendors, business partners, and other third parties, and the Company\u2019s proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information. As a result, the Company faces risks of security breaches, system disruption, theft, espionage, inadvertent release of information, and other technology-related disruptions. The Company could incur significant losses due to any such event.\nAlthough the Company has implemented security programs and disaster recovery facilities and procedures, cyber threats evolve rapidly and are becoming more sophisticated. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to secure its information and systems, cyber attackers may defeat the security measures and compromise the personal information of consumers, vendors, business partners, associates and other sensitive information. Associate error, faulty password management or other problems may compromise the security measures and result in a breach of the Company\u2019s information systems, systems disruptions, data theft or other criminal activity. This could result in a loss of sales or profits or cause the Company to incur significant costs to restore its systems or to reimburse third parties for damages.\nThreats to security or the occurrence of severe weather conditions, natural disasters or other unforeseen events could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be severely impacted by severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other events that could affect the warehouse and transportation infrastructure used by the Company and its vendors to supply the Company\u2019s corporate owned retail stores, and Food Distribution and Military customers. While the Company believes it has adopted commercially reasonable precautions, insurance programs, and contingency plans; the damage or destruction of Company facilities could compromise its ability to distribute products and generate sales. Unseasonable weather conditions that impact growing conditions and the availability of food could also adversely affect sales, profits and asset values.\nImpairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is required to perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and other long-lived tangible and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment requires management to make significant estimates about the Company\u2019s future performance, cash flows, and other assumptions that can be affected by potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, business operations, competition, or - for goodwill - the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of the Company\u2019s future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill or other assets. This could result in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination of impairment is made. The Company cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of potential impairments of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other assets become impaired, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company may not successfully manage the transition associated with its chief executive officer and other senior leaders.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the continued services of executive officers and other key personnel, as well as its ability to effectively transition to their successors. The Company appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2020 This transition may be disruptive to the Company, and if it is unable to execute an orderly transition and successfully integrate its new CEO into the leadership team, revenue, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, the Company has recently experienced turnover in other key leadership roles. Any future changes to the executive management team, including hires or departures, could cause further disruption to the business and have a negative impact on operating performance, while these operational areas are in transition. The Company can provide no assurance that it will find suitable successors to key roles as transitions occur or that any identified successor will be successfully integrated into its management team. The Company\u2019s inability to retain other key employees or effectively transition to their successors, or any delay in filling any such positions, could harm its business and results of operations.\nIt may be difficult for the Company to attract and retain well-qualified associates, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and growth.\nRecent low levels of unemployment, increased unemployment compensation benefits, and the hesitation of potential workers to work on the frontline during the pandemic have caused upward pressure on wages. If the Company is unable to attract and retain quality associates to meet its needs, the Company could be required to increase its compensation offering, reduce staffing below optimal levels, or rely more on higher-cost third-party providers, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and growth.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness\nThe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to raise additional capital or obtain financing in the future, respond to business opportunities, react to changes in its business, and make required payments on its debt.\nAs of January 2, 2021, the Company had outstanding indebtedness of $486.4 million (net of unamortized debt issuance costs), primarily related to its asset-based lending facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). Refer to Note 7 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information. If the Company is not able to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service its debt, it may need to refinance its debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. The Company may not be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on satisfactory terms or at all.\nIndebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nreduced ability to execute the Company\u2019s growth strategy, including merger and acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nreduced ability to invest in the Company, which may place it at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nincreased vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexposure to interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nreduced cash flow available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimited ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments;\nCovenants in its debt agreements restrict the Company\u2019s operational flexibility.\nThe agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility contain usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to the management and operation of the Company, including restrictions on its ability to borrow, pay dividends, or consummate certain transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants in the Company\u2019s debt agreements could result in all of its indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk due to the variable rates on its indebtedness. Debt service obligations may increase if interest rates rise.\nThe Company\u2019s borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates and expose it to interest rate risk. The Company may not be able to accurately predict changes in interest rates or mitigate their impact. If interest rates increase, debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same and the Company\u2019s profitability would decrease. A hypothetical 0.50% increase in rates applicable to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of January 2, 2021 would increase interest expense related to such debt by approximately $2.2 million per year.\nLegal, Regulatory and Legislative Risks\nThe Company\u2019s Military segment is dependent upon domestic and international military operations. A change in the military commissary system, including its supply chain, or a change in the level of governmental funding, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the Company\u2019s Military segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges in the United States and overseas, any material changes in the commissary system, the level of governmental funding to DeCA, military staffing levels, or locations of bases, or DeCA\u2019s supply chain may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of this segment. These changes could include privatization of some or all of the military commissary system, relocation or consolidation of commissaries and exchanges, base closings, troop redeployments or consolidations in the geographic areas containing commissaries and exchanges served by the Company, a change by DeCA to a self-distribution model, or a reduction in the number of persons having access to the commissaries and exchanges. Mandated reductions in the government expenditures, including those imposed as a result of a sequestration, may impact the level of funding to DeCA and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. If DeCA were to make material changes to its supply chain model, for example by limiting distribution authorization, then the Company\u2019s Military segment could be affected.\nProduct recalls or other safety concerns regarding the Company\u2019s products could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company faces risks related to the safety of the food products that it distributes or sells. It may need to recall such products for actual or alleged contamination, adulteration, mislabeling, or other safety concerns. The Company distributes fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as other fresh prepared foods. These products, and other food products that the Company sells, are at risk of contamination by disease-causing organisms such as Salmonella, E. coli, and others. These pathogens are generally found in nature, and as a result, there is a risk that they could be present in the products distributed or sold by the Company. The Company typically has little control over proper food handling before the Company\u2019s receipt of the product or once the product has been delivered to customers. Recall costs can be material. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the administrative costs of a recall, the destruction of inventory, and lost sales. Recalls and other food safety concerns can also result in adverse publicity, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of confidence in the safety and quality of its products. Customers may avoid purchasing certain products from the Company, or to seek alternative sources of supply for some or all of their food needs, even if the basis for concern is outside of the Company\u2019s control. Any loss of confidence on the part of the Company\u2019s customers would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any real or perceived issue regarding the safety of any food or drug items sold by the Company, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nA number of the Company\u2019s associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and unions may attempt to organize additional associates.\nApproximately 7% of the Company\u2019s associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d) which expire between March 2021 and October 2022. The Company expects that rising healthcare, pension and other employee benefit costs, among other issues, will continue to be important topics of negotiation with the labor unions. Upon the expiration of the Company\u2019s CBAs, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if the Company is unable to negotiate an acceptable contract with the labor unions. This could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s operations.\nFurther, if the Company is unable to control healthcare and pension costs provided for in the CBAs, the Company may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations.\nWhile the Company believes that relations with its associates are good, the Company may continue to see additional union organizing campaigns. The potential for unionization could increase as any new related legislation or regulations are passed. The Company respects its associates\u2019 right to unionize or not to unionize. However, the unionization of a significant portion of the Company\u2019s workforce could increase the Company\u2019s overall costs at the affected locations and adversely affect its flexibility to run its business in the most efficient manner to remain competitive or acquire new businesses and could adversely affect its results of operations by increasing its labor costs or otherwise restricting its ability to maximize the efficiency of its operations.\nCosts related to multi-employer pension plans and other postretirement plans could increase.\nThe Company contributes to the Central States Southeast and Southwest Pension Fund (the \u201cCentral States Plan\u201d or the \u201cPlan\u201d), a multi-employer pension plan, based on obligations arising from its CBAs with Teamsters locals 406 and 908. SpartanNash does not administer or control this Plan, and the Company has relatively little control over the level of contributions the Company is required to make. Currently, the Central States Plan is underfunded and in critical and declining status, and as a result, contributions are scheduled to increase. The Company expects that contributions to this Plan will be subject to further increases. Benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges. The amount of any increase or decrease in its required contributions to this Plan will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, the actions taken by the trustees who manage the Plan, governmental regulations, actual return on investment of Plan assets, the continued viability and contributions of other contributing employers, and the potential payment of withdrawal liability should the Company choose to exit a geographic area, among other factors.\nChanges in government regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nChanges in government regulation, including changes in the minimum wages or federal tax laws could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s financial results. The new presidential administration may propose regulations that will have a negative impact on the profitability of the Company, including new tax legislation and minimum wage requirements. The Company employs a significant number of hourly associates who are compensated at an hourly rate lower than $15.00. If minimum wage rates increase, the Company will have to increase the wages of employees who fall below the new minimum and may need to increase the wages of employees in close proximity above the new minimum to address wage compression. In addition, changes in federal tax regulations may result in significant increases in the Company\u2019s current and deferred tax liabilities, and may include changes in federal tax rates and the deductibility of certain costs.", "PERMNO": 88568, "SIC": 5141, "TIC": "SPTN"}
