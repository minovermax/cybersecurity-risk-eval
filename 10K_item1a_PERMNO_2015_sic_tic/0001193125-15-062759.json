Risk Factors.\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Shareholders, investors and other interested parties should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and the other information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below occur or if our actual results, performance or achievements differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report in Form 10-K, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially impaired and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Shareholders, investors and other interested parties should be aware that the risk factors described below and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not describe every risk facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe recent improvement in housing market conditions following a prolonged and severe housing downturn may not continue, and any slowing or reversal of the present housing recovery may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, several housing markets stabilized and began recovering after years of weak demand and excess supply during the housing downturn. In these markets, there were generally more sales of new and resale homes, higher selling prices and fewer homes available for sale, in each case as compared to the prior year. There were also more overall housing starts and construction permits authorized in the U.S., reflecting increased construction activity. These trends have been driven in large part by record-low interest rates for mortgage loans that, in combination with relatively low home selling prices, have made homeownership more affordable compared to historical levels and to rental housing costs, which have been rising over the past few years.\nWith the emerging housing recovery, we and other homebuilders generally reported increased orders and deliveries and better year-over-year financial results during the three-year period ended December 31, 2014. While some of the many negative factors that contributed to the housing downturn may have moderated, several remain, and they could return and/or intensify to inhibit any future improvement in housing market conditions. These negative factors include (i) weak general economic and employment growth that, among other things, restrains consumer incomes, consumer confidence and demand for homes; (ii) elevated levels of mortgage loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures that could add to a \u201cshadow inventory\u201d of lender-owned homes that may be sold in competition with new and other resale homes at low \u201cdistressed\u201d prices or that generate short sales activity at such price levels; (iii) a significant number of homeowners whose outstanding principal balance on their mortgage loan exceeds the market value of their home, which undermines their ability to purchase another home that they otherwise might desire and be able to afford; (iv) volatility and uncertainty in U.S. financial, credit and consumer lending markets amid slow growth or recessionary conditions; and (v) tight lending standards and practices for mortgage loans that limit consumers\u2019 ability to qualify for mortgage financing to purchase a home, including increased minimum credit score requirements, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees and required down payment amounts, more conservative appraisals, higher loan-to-value ratios and extensive buyer income and asset documentation requirements. Additional headwinds may come from the efforts and proposals of lawmakers to reduce the debt of the federal government and/or solve state budget shortfalls through tax increases and/or spending cuts, and/or government shutdowns, and financial markets\u2019 and businesses\u2019 reactions to those efforts and proposals, which could impair economic growth. Given these factors, we can provide no assurances that the present housing recovery will continue or gain further momentum, whether overall in the U.S. or in Florida.\nThe present housing recovery is relative to an extremely low level of consumer demand for homes, home sales and new residential construction activity, reflecting the severity of the housing downturn. Even with the industry upturn, sales, deliveries, revenues and profitability remain well below, and may not return to, the peak levels reached shortly before the housing downturn began. If the present housing recovery stalls or does not continue at the same pace, or any or all of the negative factors described above persist or worsen, particularly if there is limited economic growth or a decline, low growth or decreases in employment and consumer incomes, and/or continued stringent mortgage lending standards and practices, there would likely be a corresponding adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, the number of homes we deliver, our average selling prices, the amount of revenues we generate and our ability to operate profitably, and the effect may be material.\nOur business is cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nDemand for new homes is cyclical and highly sensitive to economic conditions over which we have no control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nshort- and long-term interest rates;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nemployment levels and job and personal income growth;\n\u2022\nhousing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes, among other factors;\n\u2022\navailability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global financial system and credit market stability;\n\u2022\nprivate party and government mortgage loan programs (including changes in Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) and the Federal Housing Administration (the \u201cFHA\u201d), or successor agencies, conforming mortgage loan limits, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees, down payment requirements and underwriting standards), and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices;\n\u2022\nfederal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other expenses;\n\u2022\nsupply of and prices for available new or resale homes (including lender-owned homes) and other housing alternatives, such as apartments, single-family rentals and other rental housing;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which \u201cshadow inventory\u201d enters into the housing market;\n\u2022\nhomebuyer interest in our current or new product designs and new home community locations, and general consumer interest in purchasing a home compared to choosing other housing alternatives; and\n\u2022\nreal estate taxes.\nAdverse changes in these conditions may affect our business generally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular regions or localities in which we operate. Economic conditions in some of our markets continue to be characterized by varying levels of uncertainty. Any deterioration in economic conditions or continuation of uncertain economic conditions would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions can also cause demand and prices for our homes to diminish or cause us to take longer to build our homes and make it more costly for us to do so. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because of weak market conditions and because the price of each home we sell is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as many buyers sign their home purchase contracts before construction begins. The potential difficulties described above could impact our buyers\u2019 ability to obtain suitable financing and cause some homebuyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether. In addition, because we primarily target buyers for homes in luxury lifestyle communities, we may be more susceptible to adverse changes in general and local economic conditions.\nOur geographic concentration in Florida could adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in Florida should decline.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, substantially all of our revenues were generated from our Florida operations. During the downturn from 2006 to 2010, the value of land, the demand for new homes and home selling prices declined substantially in Florida, which materially and adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although the Florida housing market continues to recover, we cannot predict the extent or timing of its further recovery, if at all. There can be no assurances that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be further adversely affected if the conditions in Florida do not continue to improve or any improvement takes place over an extended period of time. Because our operations are concentrated in Florida, a prolonged economic downturn in one or more Florida markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more geographically diversified operations. Slower rates of population growth or population declines in our Florida markets could affect the demand for housing, causing home prices in these markets to fall, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if buyer demand for new homes in Florida weakens, home selling prices may decline, which will adversely impact our profitability.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate because of the seasonal nature of our business and other factors.\nWe have historically experienced, and in the future expect to continue to experience, variability in our operating results on a quarterly basis in each of our three operating segments. Because many of our Florida homebuyers prefer to close on their new home purchases before the winter, the fourth quarter of each calendar year often produces a disproportionately large portion of our annual Homebuilding revenues, income and cash flows. Activity in our realty brokerage operations is greater during the spring and summer months as (i) buyers with families generally move when their children are out of school and (ii) Florida\u2019s seasonal residents tend to make resale home purchases prior to leaving for the summer. These factors typically result in a larger portion of Real Estate Services revenues, income and cash flows during the second and third quarters of each calendar year. In addition, many of our club members spend the winter months in Florida, thereby producing a disproportionately large portion of our annual Amenities revenues and cash flows during that time period. Accordingly, revenues and operating results for our three operating segments may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Additionally, delays, severe weather, natural disasters or significant negative economic events that occur in the fall or early winter may have a disproportionate effect on our revenues, income and cash flows. We believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. As a result of such fluctuations, the price of our common stock may experience volatility. See \u201cBusiness-Seasonality\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Seasonality\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may not be able to maintain our Homebuilding segment gross margins in the future.\nOur Homebuilding segment gross margin percentages during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 28.4%, 30.0% and 31.4%, respectively. Our Homebuilding gross margins during such three-year period were favorably impacted by the low book value of our land, which was reset to then-current fair value during September 2009 in accordance with fresh start accounting requirements upon our emergence from bankruptcy. We expect that homes delivered from communities we owned in September 2009 that were reset to then-current fair values will have a gross margin percentage approximately 5% to 10% higher than homes delivered from our most recent land acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 36% of our total owned and controlled home sites, or approximately 4,600 home sites, benefited from being reset to fair value in September 2009. While we currently have a portion of our land inventory at an attractive book value when compared to the current fair value of that land, based on the prices of the land we have purchased more recently, and as we acquire and develop land in the future at then-current market prices, we anticipate that the favorable impact of our low book value land on our Homebuilding gross margin will lessen in the future. Additionally, the opportunity to purchase substantially finished home sites in desirable locations is becoming increasingly more limited and competitive. As a result, we are spending more on land development, as we are purchasing more undeveloped land and partially finished home sites. Moreover, weak general economic conditions, including low employment and population growth, future competition and other factors may impact our ability to realize sales prices in excess of the book value of our land inventory or to continue to increase our home selling prices and increase sales in new communities and neighborhoods. These factors could impact our ability to maintain our current level of Homebuilding gross margin in the future.\nThe homebuilding industry and housing market are very competitive and such conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable land assets, financing, building materials, and skilled management talent and trade labor. We compete in each of our markets with other local, regional and national homebuilders. Other homebuilders also have long-standing relationships with local labor, materials suppliers or land sellers in certain areas, which may provide an advantage in their respective regions or local markets. In addition, a number of our primary competitors are relatively larger companies, have longer operating histories, have higher business volumes, have relationships with more suppliers and subcontractors and may have more resources or a lower cost of capital than us. We may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to certain competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours, as those competitors may be better able to withstand any future downturn in the Florida housing market. While we do not provide any mortgage brokerage services, several of our competitors do offer such services, which may give them with a competitive advantage. We also compete with other housing alternatives, such as existing home sales (including lender-owned homes acquired through foreclosure or short sales) and rental housing. The competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can result in:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in our acquiring raw materials, skilled management and trade labor at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour selling homes at lower prices;\n\u2022\nour offering or increasing sales incentives, discounts or price concessions for our homes;\n\u2022\nour delivering fewer homes;\n\u2022\nour incurring higher construction and land costs;\n\u2022\nour selling fewer homes or experiencing higher home purchase contract cancellations by buyers;\n\u2022\nimpairments in the value of our real estate inventories and other assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in acquiring desirable land assets that meet our investment return criteria, and in selling our interests in land assets that no longer meet such criteria on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\ndelays in the construction of our homes; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in securing external financing, surety bonds (performance and financial) or letters of credit facilities on favorable terms.\nThese competitive conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by decreasing our revenues, impairing our ability to successfully execute our land acquisition and land asset management strategies, increasing our costs and/or diminishing growth in our Homebuilding segment.\nLabor and raw materials and building supply shortages and price fluctuations and other problems in the construction of our communities could delay or increase the costs of home construction and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe homebuilding industry has, from time to time, experienced labor and raw material shortages and has been adversely affected by volatility in global commodity prices. In particular, shortages and fluctuations in the prices for labor, concrete, drywall, lumber or other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our communities. These labor and material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the regions in which we operate experience natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. The cost of labor and raw materials may also be adversely affected during periods of shortage or high inflation. We have also observed that the cost of labor and raw materials has been increasing as a result of an improving housing market in Florida. If sales prices of homes do not keep pace with these increased costs, our gross margins could be negatively affected. During the recent economic downturn, a large number of qualified tradespeople went out of business or otherwise exited the market, which may limit capacity for new construction until the labor base grows. In addition, the cost of petroleum products, which are used to deliver our materials, fluctuates and may be subject to increased volatility as a result of geopolitical events or accidents, which could affect the price of our important raw materials. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must also contend with other risks associated with construction activities, including the inability to obtain insurance or obtaining insurance at significantly increased rates, cost overruns, labor disputes, unforeseen environmental or engineering problems, work stoppages and natural disasters, any of which could delay construction and result in a substantial increase in costs that would reduce our profitability. Claims may be asserted against us for construction defects, architectural and/or design defects, personal injury or property damage, product liability and warranty claims, and these claims may give rise to liability. Where we hire contractors, if there are unforeseen events like the bankruptcy of, or an uninsured or under-insured loss claimed against, our contractors, we may become responsible for the losses or other obligations of the contractors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Should losses in excess of insured limits occur, the losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event that a contractor for our residential construction experiences significant cost overruns or delays and is not able to satisfactorily address such issues or if buyers make claims for rescission arising out of substantial delays in completion of a building and their units.\nBecause our business depends on the acquisition of new land, a shortage of available land could limit our ability to develop new communities, increase land costs and reduce our revenues and/or negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur long-term success and growth strategy depend, in part, on the continued availability of suitable land at acceptable prices. The availability of land for purchase at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control. We may compete for available land with entities that possess significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, we may be unable to obtain financing to purchase new land on satisfactory terms or at all. Competition generally may reduce the amount of land available and the willingness of sellers to sell at reasonable prices, increasing the cost of such land. Restrictive governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, zoning regulations and environmental requirements, may also affect the availability and market value of land. If sufficient suitable land opportunities do not become available, it could limit our ability to develop new communities, increase land costs and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the market value of our land inventory decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs.\nThe risk of owning developed and undeveloped land can be substantial for us. Our current growth strategy will require us to invest a significant portion of our capital in new land acquisitions over the next several years. The successful execution of this strategy will significantly increase the amount of land that we hold. The market value of the undeveloped land, buildable home sites and housing inventories we hold can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions. There is an inherent risk that the value of the land owned by us may decline after being purchased. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. In certain circumstances, a grant of entitlements or development agreement with respect to a particular parcel of land may include restrictions on the transfer of such entitlements to a buyer of such land, which may increase our exposure to decreases in the price of such entitled land by restricting our ability to sell it for its full entitled value. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost that we will not be able to fully recover or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. In addition, our deposits for home sites controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk. Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation and planning), political conditions, the condition of financial markets, both local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of buyers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject valuations to uncertainty. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory or land development costs increase beyond our anticipated construction costs, our profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes.\nDuring several years prior to 2012, we experienced negative economic and market conditions, which resulted in the impairment of a number of our land positions. Generally, we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that asset. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $1.2 million because the estimated undiscounted cash flow for one of our Amenities assets did not exceed its carrying value; however, we did not record any such charges during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. We regularly review the value of our land holdings and continue to review our holdings on a periodic basis. If economic or market conditions deteriorate, we may impair additional land holdings and projects, write off option deposits (if applicable), sell homes or land at a loss, and/or hold land or homes in inventory longer than planned. Additionally, inventory carrying costs can be significant, particularly if inventory must be held for longer than planned, which can trigger asset impairments in a poorly performing project or market. If, as planned, we significantly increase the amount of land we hold over the next several years, we will also materially increase our exposure to the risks associated with owning land, which means that if economic and market conditions deteriorate, this deterioration would have a significantly greater adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to develop our communities successfully and in a timely manner, our revenues, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nBefore a community generates any revenues, material expenditures are required to acquire land, to obtain or renew permits, development approvals and entitlements and to construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. There may be a lag between the time we acquire land or options for land for development or developed home sites and the time we can bring the communities to market and sell homes. We can also experience significant delays in obtaining permits, development approvals and entitlements. Additionally, we may also have to renew existing permits and there can be no assurances that these permits will be renewed. Lag time varies on a project-by-project basis depending on the complexity of the project, its stage of development when acquired, and the regulatory and community issues involved. Litigation challenging project approvals could also add additional time to the development approval process. As a result of these possible lag times, we face the risk that demand for housing may decline during this period and we will not be able to dispose of developed properties on undeveloped land or home sites acquired for development at expected prices or within anticipated time frames or at all. The market value of home inventories, undeveloped land, options for land and developed home sites can fluctuate significantly because of changing market conditions. In addition, inventory carrying costs (including interest on funds used to acquire land or build homes) can be significant and can adversely affect our performance. Furthermore, after a delay, we may face increased development costs due to prices that exceed our expectations as a result of inflation or other matters that are beyond our control.\nIt generally takes several years for a community development project to achieve cumulative positive cash flow. Moreover, there is a higher degree of risk to our homebuilding operations if we expand our business in the future beyond the current well-established markets or outside of Florida. Our inability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flows from these operations in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we experience delays that result in a decline in market values of our home inventories, undeveloped land, and options for land and developed home sites, we may be forced to sell homes or other property at a loss or for prices that generate lower profit margins than we anticipate. We may also be required to make material write-downs of the book value of our real estate assets if values decline.\nIn the past, we have incurred losses and we may have difficulty maintaining and/or increasing profitability in the future.\nSubsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy in September 2009, there were quarters and years where the Company experienced losses from continuing operations before income taxes. Notwithstanding our return to operating profitability during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we may not be able to maintain and/or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly, our business will be harmed. As a result, the price of our common stock may decline. For a more complete description of our historical operating results, see: (i) Selected Financial Data in Item 6 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; (ii) Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; and (iii) our audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may re-enter the tower business in the future and, as a result, we may incur significant pre-construction costs and be subject to costly delays and unfavorable changes in market conditions, each of which could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nBefore a tower generates any Homebuilding segment revenues, we may make material expenditures to, among other things: (i) acquire land; (ii) obtain permits, development approvals and entitlements; (iii) market units within the tower; and (iv) design and construct the building. It typically takes several years for us to acquire the land and construct, market and deliver units in a tower. Completion times vary on a building-by-building basis depending on the complexity of the project, its stage of development when acquired and the regulatory and community issues involved. As a result of such potential delays in completing a tower, we face the risk that the demand for our towers may decline during the extended period needed to ready the units for sale and, therefore, we may be forced to sell units at a loss or for prices that generate lower gross margins than we initially anticipated. Furthermore, if construction is delayed, we may face increased construction and other related costs as a result of inflation or other factors beyond our control, which could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. If real estate values decline during the construction period or before we can sell the units, we may be required to recognize material write-downs of the book value of our towers because the carrying costs of such towers may not be fully recoverable.\nThe tower business is subject to significant swings in delivery volume due to the extended construction time for towers, the levels of pre-sale activity and the relatively short delivery time of pre-sold units once a building is completed.\nIf we re-enter the tower business and our volume of business is substantive, our quarterly operating results will fluctuate depending on the construction time for our towers, the levels of pre-sale activity and the relatively short delivery time of pre-sold units once a building is completed. Depending on the number of towers that are completed during any given quarterly period, our future operating results may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters when compared to other quarters.\nOur business and results of operations are dependent on the availability and skill of subcontractors.\nAll of our residential construction work is done by third-party subcontractors with us acting as the general contractor. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our construction depend on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. While we anticipate being able to obtain sufficient materials and reliable subcontractors during times of material shortages and believe that our relationships with subcontractors are good, we do not have long-term contractual commitments with any subcontractors, and there can be no assurances that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in the areas where we conduct our operations. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, despite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper construction practices or installing defective materials in our homes. When we discover these issues, we, generally through our subcontractors, repair the homes in accordance with our new home warranty policy and as required by law. We typically reserve approximately 0.5% of the selling price of each home we sell to provide customer service to our homebuyers, which is subject to change based on our actual warranty experience. These reserves are established based on market practices, our historical experiences and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. However, the cost of satisfying our warranty and other legal obligations in these instances may be significantly higher than our warranty reserves, and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from our subcontractors. Regardless of the steps we take, we can, in some instances, be subject to fines or other penalties, and our reputation may be injured.\nAdditionally, although subcontractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the homebuilding industry, if regulatory agencies deem the employees of our subcontractors to be our employees, we could be responsible for wage, hour and other employment-related liabilities of our subcontractors.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which may substantially increase our costs of doing business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations by our employees or representatives may harm us.\nOur Homebuilding segment operations, including land development activities, are subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, including environmental, zoning and land use, building, employment and worker health and safety regulations. These regulations affect all aspects of the homebuilding process and can substantially delay or increase the costs of homebuilding activities, even on land for which we already have approvals. In addition, larger land parcels are generally undeveloped and may not have all of the governmental approvals necessary to develop and construct homes. If we are unable to obtain these approvals or obtain approvals that restrict our ability to use the land in ways that we do not anticipate, the value of the parcel will be negatively impacted. During the development process, we must obtain a number of approvals from various governmental authorities that regulate matters such as:\n\u2022\npermitted land uses, levels of density and architectural designs;\n\u2022\nthe building of roadways and creation of traffic control mechanisms and the installation of infrastructure for utility services, such as water, sewage and waste disposal, drainage and storm water control, electricity and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe dedication of acreage for open space, parks, schools and other community services; and\n\u2022\nthe preservation of habitat for endangered species and wetlands, storm water control and other environmental matters.\nThese government entities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority. The approval process can be lengthy and cause significant delays or result in a temporary or permanent halt to the development process. The approval process may involve public input and public hearings and may also be opposed by neighboring landowners, consumer or environmental groups, among others, which in turn can also cause significant delays or permanently halt the development process. Litigation challenging government approvals could also cause significant delays or halt the development process. Delays or a temporary or permanent halt in the development process can cause substantial increases to development costs, delays in constructing and selling homes, or cause us to abandon the project and to sell the affected land at a loss, which in turn could harm our results of operations.\nAdditionally, new housing developments are often subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, highways and other public improvements. The costs of these assessments can be substantial and can cause increases in the effective prices of our homes, which in turn could reduce our sales and/or profitability.\nOur projects may also contain water features such as lakes or marinas for boating or other recreational activities. These water features may be subject to governmental regulations that could result in high maintenance costs. Additionally, there is the potential for liability related to the recreational use of such water features by residents and guests.\nAs climate change concerns grow, legislation and regulatory activity is expected to continue and become more onerous. Similarly, energy-related initiatives will impact a wide variety of companies throughout the world and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel and concrete, these initiatives could have an indirect adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations to the extent the suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive or onerous energy or environmental-related regulations. Additionally, energy efficiency requirements imposed by government regulations on new housing development could add to building costs, which in turn could reduce profitability.\nOur title insurance operations are subject to applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to administrative enforcement actions, the loss of required licenses and other required approvals, claims for monetary damages or demands for loan repurchase from investors, and rescission or voiding of the loan by the homebuyer.\nFlorida has enacted legislation to regulate homeowner associations, which affects the master and condominium associations we manage or control in our communities. Furthermore, we are also subject to state legislation and Internal Revenue Service rulings pertaining to community development districts or similar development authorities (collectively, \u201cCDDs\u201d). A CDD is a local, special purpose government framework authorized by Florida\u2019s Uniform Community Development District Act of 1980, as amended, and provides a mechanism to manage and finance the infrastructure required to develop new communities. CDDs are legal entities with the ability to enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued, and impose and levy taxes and/or assessments. CDDs are subject to audit and rulings from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax-exempt status of their bonds.\nIt is possible that individuals acting on our behalf (including our contractors and their subcontractors) could intentionally or unintentionally violate some of the foregoing federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we endeavor to take immediate corrective action if we become aware of such violations, we may incur fines or penalties as a result of those actions and our reputation with governmental agencies and our buyers may be damaged. Furthermore, other acts of bad judgment may also result in negative financial consequences.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our growth and development opportunities may be limited and more costly as a result of legislative, regulatory or municipal requirements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also restrict or delay our homebuilding activity. The inability to grow our business or pay these costs could reduce our profitability. Additionally, our operating costs may also be affected by our compliance with, or our being subject to, environmental laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous or toxic substances of, under, or in our properties. These costs could be significant and could result in decreased profitability or the inability to develop our land as originally intended.\nDespite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities, we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future. Although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements, they could result in time-consuming and expensive compliance programs and substantial expenditures, which could cause delays and increase our costs of operations. We may also become subject to challenges by third-parties, such as environmental groups or neighborhood associations, under environmental laws and regulations regarding the permits and other approvals for our projects and operations. In those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved and related agency rule-making and/or litigation is ongoing, the outcome of such rule-making and litigation can be unpredictable and can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on or the prohibition of development and building activity in identified environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in policies, rules and regulations and their interpretation and application. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies conduct inspections of our properties for compliance with these environmental laws and regulations and a failure to strictly comply may result in an assessment of fines and penalties and an obligation to undertake corrective actions. Any such enforcement actions may increase our costs.\nUnder various environmental laws and regulations, current or former owners or operators of real estate, whether leased or owned, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third-parties for related damages, including bodily injury, and investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination, regardless of whether such contamination or environmental conditions were created by the current or prior owner or tenant, or by a third-party or neighboring property. The costs of any required removal, investigation or remediation of such substances or the costs of defending against environmental claims may be substantial. The presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate such substances properly, may also adversely affect our ability to sell the land or to borrow using the land as security. Although environmental site assessments conducted at our properties have not revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and we are not aware of any material environmental liability or concerns, there can be no assurances that the environmental assessments that we have undertaken have revealed all potential environmental liabilities, or that an environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernment entities in regions where we operate have adopted or may adopt slow growth or no growth initiatives, which could adversely affect our ability to build or timely build in these areas.\nLocal governments in some of the areas where we operate have approved, and others where we operate or may operate in the future may also approve, various \u201cslow growth\u201d or \u201cno growth\u201d homebuilding initiatives and other ballot measures that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those jurisdictions. Approval of \u201cslow growth,\u201d \u201cno growth\u201d or similar initiatives (including the effect of these initiatives on existing entitlements and zoning) could adversely affect our ability to build or timely build and sell homes in the affected markets and/or create additional administrative and regulatory requirements and costs, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSubstantial increases in mortgage interest rates or the unavailability of mortgage financing could lead to fewer home sales, which would reduce our revenues.\nOur Homebuilding and Real Estate Services segments depend on the ability of some homebuyers to obtain financing for the purchase of their homes. Since 2009, the mortgage lending industry in the U.S. has experienced significant instability, beginning with increased defaults on subprime loans and other nonconforming loans and compounded by expectations of increasing interest payment requirements and further defaults. This in turn resulted in a decline in the market value of many mortgage loans and related securities. Lenders, regulators and others questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan products and programs offered in recent years. Credit requirements have tightened, and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities has declined. The deterioration in credit quality during the downturn had caused almost all lenders to stop offering subprime mortgages and most other loan products that do not conform to standards set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA. Fewer loan products, tighter loan qualifications and a reduced willingness of lenders to make loans may continue to make it more difficult for certain buyers to finance the purchase of our homes. These developments may delay the continued improvement in the housing market. If our potential homebuyers, the buyers of our homebuyers\u2019 existing homes or other customers of our Real Estate Services businesses cannot obtain suitable financing, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry, the federal government has taken on a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the FHA. The liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market. Several federal government officials have proposed changing the nature of the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the federal government and even nationalizing or eliminating these entities entirely. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were dissolved or if the federal government determined to stop providing liquidity support to the mortgage market, there would be a reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions. Any such reduction would likely have an adverse effect on interest rates, mortgage availability and the sales of new homes. It is also possible that these entities, as reformed, or the successors to these entities may require changes to the way title insurance is priced or delivered, changes to standard policy terms or other changes, which may make the title insurance business less profitable and adversely affect our title insurance operations.\nMoreover, the FHA insures mortgage loans that generally have lower loan payment requirements and qualification standards compared to conventional guidelines, and as a result, can be a source for financing the sale of our homes. In recent years, lenders have taken a more conservative view of FHA guidelines causing significant tightening of borrower eligibility for approval. Availability of condominium financing and minimum credit score benchmarks has reduced opportunity for those buyers. In the near future, further restrictions are expected on FHA-insured loans, including limitations on seller-paid closing costs and concessions. This or any other restriction may negatively affect the availability or affordability of FHA financing, which could adversely affect the volume of homes sold to those buyers seeking FHA financing.\nThe passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) in July 2010 implemented new requirements relating to residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices. These include, among other things, minimum underwriting standards, limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements, retention of credit risk and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings. The effect of such provisions may reduce the availability of loans to borrowers and/or increase the costs to borrowers to obtain such loans. Any such reduction could adversely affect our home sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards is limited as a result of previous \u201cownership changes\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may become further limited if we experience future ownership changes under Section 382 or if we do not generate enough taxable income in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had recorded a deferred tax asset of $110.8 million, which was net of a valuation allowance of $70.5 million. Additionally, at such date, we had (i) $303.9 million of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards for federal income tax purposes and (ii) $278.4 million of NOL carryforwards for Florida income and franchise tax purposes, a portion of which were subject to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Under federal income tax law, we generally can use our NOL carryforwards (and certain related tax credits) to offset ordinary taxable income, thereby reducing our federal income tax liability, for up to 20 years from the year in which the losses were generated, after which time they will expire. State NOL carryforwards (and certain related tax credits) generally may be used to offset future state taxable income for a period of time ranging from 5 to 20 years from the year in which the losses were generated, depending on the state, after which time they will expire. Moreover, the rate at which we can utilize our federal NOL carryforwards is also limited (which could result in NOL carryforwards expiring prior to their use) each time we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). A Section 382 ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders who are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 generally imposes an annual limit on the amount of post-ownership change federal taxable income that may be offset with pre-ownership change federal NOL carryforwards equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the federal long-term tax-exempt rate in effect at the time of the ownership change. We have previously experienced ownership changes affecting our current federal NOL carryforwards. Most states, including Florida, have statutes or provisions in their tax codes that function similar to the federal rules under Section 382. Moreover, our ability to use our federal and state NOL carryforwards may be limited if we fail to generate enough taxable income in the future before they expire, which may be the result of changes in the markets in which we do business, our profitability and/or general economic conditions. Existing and future limitations under Section 382 and other similar statutes and our inability to generate enough taxable income in the future could result in a substantial portion of our federal and state NOL carryforwards expiring before they are used and, therefore, could reduce the value of our deferred tax assets. If our future results of operations are less than projected or if the timing and jurisdiction of our future taxable income varies from our estimates, an increase in the Company\u2019s deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be required at that time, thereby resulting in an increase in the Company\u2019s income tax provision for financial reporting purposes. Furthermore, our expectations for the use of our deferred tax assets are based on numerous assumptions and we can give no assurances that these assumptions will be accurate.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify, complete or integrate acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.\nA principal component of our business strategy is to continue to grow profitably in a controlled manner, including, where appropriate, through land and other acquisitions. Any future acquisitions, especially those beyond our current well-established markets or outside of Florida, would be accompanied by risks such as:\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain development and other approvals from various governmental authorities necessary to close acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe overvaluation of our targeted acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nour potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation or disposition of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies or businesses; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties involved in acquisitions that are outside of our existing markets.\nMoreover, acquisitions may require us to incur or assume additional indebtedness, resulting in increased leverage. Any significant acquisition may result in a weakening of our financial condition and an increase in our cost of borrowing. Acquisitions may also require us to issue additional equity, resulting in dilution to existing shareholders.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be successful in implementing our acquisition strategy, and growth may not continue at historical levels, or at all. The failure to identify or complete acquisitions, or successfully execute our plans for an acquisition, could adversely affect our future growth. Specifically, any delays or difficulties encountered prior to or after the closing of such acquisitions could increase our costs and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we typically enter into purchase or option contracts for the acquisition of land, there can be no assurances that even after execution of these contracts we will be able to consummate these acquisitions on the terms included therein or at all, because, but not limited to, of our inability to obtain governmental approvals and entitlements, matters uncovered during due diligence, including environmental and title matters, and other regulatory and community issues. Moreover, in cases where we do not go forward with an acquisition, we may lose our deposits and/or be unable to recover our due diligence, development and other transaction costs. When we enter into non-binding letters of intent for land acquisitions, for example, it is also possible that we may choose not to, or may be unable to, for reasons beyond our control, enter into binding agreements. Additionally, in any land acquisition, we may underestimate land development costs, which could reduce our profitability.\nEven if we overcome these challenges and risks, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and there may be other unanticipated or unidentified effects. While we would typically seek protection through warranties and indemnities, as applicable, significant liabilities may not be identified during due diligence or come to light after the expiration of any warranty or indemnity periods. Additionally, while we would seek to limit our ongoing exposure, for example, through liability caps and period limits on warranties and indemnities in the case of disposals, some warranties and indemnities may give rise to unexpected and significant liabilities. Any claims arising in the future may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in certain joint ventures where we may be adversely impacted by the failure of the joint venture or the other partners in the joint venture to fulfill their obligations.\nWe selectively enter into business relationships through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third-parties. These partnerships and joint ventures have historically been utilized to acquire, develop, market and operate timeshare, golf course and other amenity projects. Our joint venture operations face all of the inherent risks associated with real estate and construction, such as obtaining permits, complying with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and obtaining financing, that are described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We face the additional risk that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. Therefore, we depend heavily on the other partners in each joint venture to both cooperate and make mutually acceptable decisions regarding the conduct of the business and affairs of the joint venture and ensure that they, and the joint venture, fulfill their respective obligations to us and to third-parties. If the other partners in our joint ventures do not provide such cooperation or fulfill those obligations due to their financial condition, strategic business interests (which may be contrary to ours), or otherwise, we may be required to spend additional resources and suffer losses, each of which could be significant. Moreover, our ability to recoup such expenditures and losses by exercising remedies against such partners may be limited due to potential legal defenses they may have, their respective financial condition and other circumstances. Furthermore, the termination of a joint venture may also give rise to lawsuits and legal costs.\nAlthough our joint ventures do not have outstanding debt, the partners may agree to incur debt to fund partnership and joint venture operations in the future. If our joint ventures incur indebtedness in the future, the lenders may require us and the other partners to provide guarantees and indemnities to the lenders with respect to the joint venture\u2019s debt, which may be triggered under certain conditions when the joint venture fails to fulfill its obligations under its loan agreements.\nTax law and interest rate changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive.\nTax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive. Certain expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for an individual\u2019s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law. Various proposals have been publicly discussed to limit mortgage interest deductions and repeal or otherwise limit the taxable income gain exclusion attributable to the sale of a principal residence. If the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws, including as some lawmakers have proposed, to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions without offsetting provisions, then the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase substantially for many of our potential buyers. These circumstances could adversely impact demand for and/or selling prices of new homes.\nIncreases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding, could adversely affect the ability of potential buyers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes. Fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open spaces, road improvements, and/or provide low and moderate income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the availability of mortgage financing and increases in interest rates as a result of changes to U.S. monetary policies could significantly increase the costs of owning a home by making it more costly or extremely difficult to obtain financing, which in turn would adversely impact the demand for, and the selling prices of, homes. Any increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales, revenues, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by natural disasters.\nThe Florida climate presents risks of natural disasters. To the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, floods, wildfires, soil subsidence and other weather-related and geological events, including sinkholes, or other natural disasters or similar events occur, our business may be adversely affected by requiring us to delay or halt construction, experience shortages in labor and raw materials, or to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects under construction and unsold homes. There is also the possibility of environmental disasters occurring, such as oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, which could result in costly repairs to our properties in affected areas and negatively impact the demand for new homes in those areas and otherwise adversely affect our business operations in the affected areas. There is also growing concern from the scientific community that an increase in average temperatures globally due to emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities will cause significant changes in global weather patterns and, as a result, increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. In the future, certain losses may not be insurable and a sizable uninsured loss could materially affect our business. In addition, due to the concentrated nature of our operations, natural disasters affecting more than one of our Florida markets could result in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of operations. See \u201c-Our geographic concentration in Florida could adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in Florida should decline.\u201d\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to property and liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully compensated by insurance. Additionally, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur a financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future income from that property. Moreover, we have a number of properties in Florida that are susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms. While we generally carry windstorm and flood coverage with respect to these properties, the policies contain per occurrence deductibles and aggregate loss limits and sub-limits that limit the amount of proceeds that we may be able to recover. Additionally, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by uninsured or excluded risks. We may be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property. Material losses or liabilities in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future.\nWe act as a title agent and are subject to audits and contractual obligations due to our title insurance operations.\nWe act as a title agent for underwriters through our subsidiary, Watermark Realty, Inc. The title insurance industry is closely regulated by the Florida Department of Financial Services, Office of Insurance Regulation, which issues regulations that impose licensing and other compliance requirements on our title insurance business and require that we offer title insurance products in accordance with a promulgated rate schedule.\nAs a result of our position as a title agent, we are subject to regular and routine audits by title insurance underwriters for which we issue title policies. These audits review our compliance and risk management pertaining to escrow procedures, as well as our regulatory and underwriting procedures. Additionally, we are subject to compliance with the procedures imposed by our agency contracts with underwriters. Title agencies are subject to liability in the event of any breach thereof arising from deviations from the agency contract requirements, including indemnifying the underwriter for claims.\nOur real estate brokerage business is generally subject to intense competition.\nWe compete with national and regional independent real estate organizations, other national real estate franchisors, franchisees of local and regional real estate franchisors, discount brokerages and smaller niche companies competing in local areas. Real estate brokers compete for sales and marketing business primarily on the basis of services offered, reputation, utilization of technology, personal contacts and brokerage commission.\nThe real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants, including participants pursuing non-traditional methods of marketing real estate, such as Internet-based brokerage or brokers who discount their commissions. Discount brokers have had varying degrees of success and, while they were negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in the residential housing market, they may adjust their business model and increase their market presence in the future. Listing aggregators and other web-based real estate service providers may also begin to compete for our company-owned brokerage business by establishing relationships with independent real estate agents and/or buyers and sellers of homes.\nWe also compete for the services of qualified licensed independent real estate agents. Some of the firms competing for real estate agents use a different model to compensate their agents, whereby agents are compensated for the revenue generated by other agents that they recruit to those firms. This model may be appealing to certain agents and hinder our ability to attract and retain those agents. The ability of our brokerage offices to retain independent real estate agents is generally subject to numerous factors, including the sales commissions that they receive and their perception of brand value. Competition for real estate agents could reduce our commissions, after giving effect to the split with independent real estate agents, and possibly increase our marketing costs.\nIndependent real estate agents that work for our real estate brokerage business could take actions that could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe real estate agents that work for our real estate brokerage business are independent contractors and, as such, are not our employees, and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day activities. If these independent real estate agents were to provide a diminished quality of service to buyers, our image and reputation may suffer materially, thereby adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, independent real estate agents may engage or be accused of engaging in unlawful or tortious acts such as, for example, violating the anti-discrimination requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Such acts or the accusation of such acts could harm our image, reputation and goodwill.\nOur real estate brokerage business must comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the jurisdictions in which we do business.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations containing general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales associates, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales associates, administration of escrow funds, collection of commissions, advertising and consumer disclosures. Under Florida law, real estate brokers are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage business, including the supervision of their sales associates. Although real estate sales agents historically have been classified as independent contractors, rules and interpretations of federal and state employment laws and regulations could change, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations, and those changes may impact industry practices and our real estate brokerage operations. Our brokerage practices are also subject to regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nOur development and construction of condominiums and subdivisions are subject to claims from the related condominium association and/or homeowners association at each project.\nA portion of our business is dedicated to the formation of condominiums, which are governed by condominium associations. Although we retain control of the condominium associations at a number of our projects, we are required to transfer control of the condominium association\u2019s board of directors once we trigger one of several statutory thresholds, with the most likely triggers being tied to the sale of not less than a majority of units to third-party owners. Although we maintain reserves for turnover purposes, transfer of control can result in claims with respect to deficiencies in operating funds and reserves, construction defects and other condominium-related matters by the condominium association and/or the third-party condominium unit owners. Any such material claims, including those in excess of our established reserves, could negatively affect our reputation in condominium development and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole.\nA portion of our business is dedicated to the formation of subdivisions, which are governed by homeowners associations. As with condominium associations, although we retain control of the homeowners associations at a number of our projects, we are required to transfer control of the homeowners association\u2019s board of directors once we trigger one of several statutory thresholds, with the most likely triggers being tied to the sale of not less than a majority of subdivided home sites to third-party owners. Transfer of control can result in claims with respect to deficiencies in operating funds and reserves (to the extent applicable), construction defects and other subdivision-related matters by the homeowners association and/or the third-party subdivided lot owners. Any such material claims, including those in excess of our established reserves (if any), could negatively affect our reputation in subdivision development and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole.\nShortfalls in association revenues leading to increased levels of homeowner association deficit funding could negatively affect our business.\nAs a developer, we typically deficit fund the homeowner associations we control until the turnover of the association to the residents. If we have insufficient sales of homes in any community or if the number of delinquencies with respect to the payment of association assessments by the homeowners increases in any of our communities (in each case resulting in shortfalls in association revenues), our deficit funding levels may increase from historical levels, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased insurance risk and adverse changes in economic conditions could negatively affect our business.\nInsurance and surety companies are continuously re-examining their business risks and, in connection therewith, have taken actions, including increasing premiums, requiring higher self-insured retentions and deductibles, requiring additional collateral on surety bonds, reducing limits, restricting coverage, imposing exclusions, such as mold damage, sinkholes, sabotage and terrorism, and refusing to underwrite certain risks and classes of business. Any increased premiums, mandated exclusions, changes in limits, changes in coverage, changes in terms and conditions or reductions in the amounts of bonding capacity available may adversely affect our ability to obtain appropriate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWarranty, liability and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs a homebuilder, we have been, and continue to be, subject to construction, architectural and design defects, product liability and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims related to moisture intrusion and mold. These claims are common to the homebuilding industry and can be costly.\nIn certain legal proceedings, plaintiffs may seek class action status with potential class sizes that vary from case to case. Class action lawsuits can be costly to defend and, if we were to lose any certified class action lawsuit, could result in substantial potential liability for us. We record reserves, if necessary, for such matters in our consolidated financial statements. With respect to certain general liability exposures, including construction defects, moisture intrusion and related mold claims and product liability, the interpretation of underlying current and future trends, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process is highly judgmental due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure exhibiting unique characteristics. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for construction defects, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically.\nAlthough we maintain warranty and other reserves, we obtain insurance for construction defect claims and generally seek to require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for some portion of a liability arising from their work. Such policies and reserves may not be available or adequate to cover our ultimate liability for damages, costs of repairs and/or the expense of litigation surrounding claims. Future claims may also arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors. In addition, our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in our estimates and assumptions pertaining to these proceedings or due to the ultimate resolution of any related litigation. Furthermore, one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent. Any actual or threatened claim against us, regardless of its merit, may lead to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business, reputation and home sales.\nWe may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel.\nAn important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. Our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, changes in immigration laws, trends in labor force migration and other fluctuations in the labor market. If any of our key personnel were to cease employment with us, our operating results could suffer. Our ability to retain our key personnel or to attract suitable replacements should any members of our management team leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. Furthermore, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for key personnel whose services we may lose would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management away from our existing operations. In addition, we do not maintain key person insurance in respect of any members of our senior management team. The loss of any of our management members or key personnel could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo effectively compete in our industry, we must ensure that the experience and knowledge of our employees is institutionalized and is not lost when personnel leave us due to retirement, redundancy or other reasons. Failure to do so would adversely affect our standard of service to our homebuyers and other customers, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that were not discharged in our bankruptcy proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nOn September 3, 2009, our predecessor company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cDebtors\u201d) emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization filed by the Debtors that was declared effective on such date. Substantially all of the material claims relating to the operation of our business prior to September 3, 2009 were discharged and resolved pursuant to the plan of reorganization and the related confirmation order issued by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington. Although the plan of reorganization contains various mechanisms and provisions intended to protect us from any liability for any act or omission prior to September 3, 2009 or a condition in existence as of such date, some claimants have attempted and may continue to attempt to characterize their respective claims as arising after September 3, 2009 even though such acts, omissions, or conditions arose prior to September 3, 2009. The ultimate resolution of any such claims and other obligations, including the matter discussed under Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nInflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if housing demand declines.\nInflation can have an adverse impact on our results of operations because increasing costs of land, materials and labor may require us to increase the selling prices of our homes to maintain satisfactory gross margins. If there is a reversal or slowing of the current housing market recovery, we may not be able to sufficiently increase our home selling prices due to, among other things, competition in the industry. In such an environment, we may not be able to raise home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation and our gross margins could decrease. Ultimately, we might need to decrease home selling prices, which could further reduce our gross margins and require us to reduce the carrying value of our land inventory. Moreover, our cost of capital increases as a result of inflation and the purchasing power of our cash resources declines. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may yield higher inflation and cause an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn increase in home order cancellations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 6.8%, 4.7% and 3.0% of our total home orders were cancelled, respectively. In the normal course of business, buyers contracted to buy a home occasionally do not close on the transaction whether due to the economic downturn, failure to satisfy contingencies, mutual termination, default by the buyer or otherwise. An increase in the rate or number of cancellations may adversely impact our home sales revenues and results of operations, as well as our backlog. In cases of cancellations, we remarket the home and usually keep any deposits that we are permitted to retain. These deposits may not cover the additional carrying costs and costs to resell the home.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to quickly sell our properties for satisfactory prices in response to adverse changes in economic or financial conditions.\nDue to the relative lack of liquidity in real estate investments, we may be limited in our ability to respond to changes in economic or financial conditions by quickly selling our properties. As a result, we may be forced to hold properties that do not generate any revenues. Alternatively, we may be compelled to sell homes or land at a loss. Under either scenario, we may be required to record impairment charges. Additionally, we face the general unpredictability of the real estate market and may not always know whether we can sell homes at the prices we set or how long it may take to find a buyer and close the sale of a property.\nPoor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues and/or results of operations to decline.\nAs a community developer, we may be expected by community residents from time to time to resolve any real or perceived issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation, development and/or turnover of our communities. Any efforts made by us in resolving these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and any subsequent action by these residents could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues and/or results of operations to decline. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or modify our community development plans, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to litigation, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn the future, we may become subject to litigation, including claims relating to our operations, securities offerings or otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Litigation or the resolution of litigation may affect the availability or cost of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers.\nA major health and safety incident could adversely affect our operations, create potential liabilities and harm our reputation.\nConstruction sites and our Homebuilding segment pose inherent health and safety risks to our employees and others. Due to regulatory requirements and the scale of our business, our health and safety performance is vital to the continued success of our business. A major health and safety incident may cause us to incur penalties and could expose us to liabilities. In addition, we may face significant negative publicity, which would adversely affect our reputation and relationships with members of the community, regulatory agencies, suppliers and contractors.\nInformation technology failures, data security breaches and other similar adverse events could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology and other computer resources to perform important operational and marketing activities as well as to maintain our business and employee records and financial data. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer attacks by hackers, viruses, catastrophes, hardware and software failures and breach of data security protocols by our personnel. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other actions to minimize the risk of cyber incidents and otherwise protect our information technology, computer intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated and even the controls that we have installed might be breached. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in our information technology systems that involve interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, personal and confidential information, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us.\nWe may face utility or resource shortages or cost fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nA shortage of utilities or natural resources in geographic areas in which we operate may make it difficult for us to obtain regulatory approvals to begin our projects. Our existing projects may also be delayed, which would impose additional costs and jeopardize our ability to complete construction and meet our contractual obligations. Such shortages could adversely affect our inventories, particularly concrete and drywall, and could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our business. Additionally, municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. Those potential actions may cause delays in our projects, increase our costs or limit our ability to operate in those geographic areas, each of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGeopolitical risks and market disruption could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeopolitical events, acts of war or terrorism or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities throughout the world or health pandemics, may have a substantial impact on the economy, consumer confidence, the housing market, our employees and our customers. Historically, perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars and related geopolitical risks have also created significant economic and political uncertainties. If any such events were to occur, or there was a perception that they were about to occur, they could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe intend to use leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to employ prudent levels of leverage to finance our business, including the acquisition and development of our home sites and construction of our homes. As of December 31, 2014, we had $250.0 million of total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding. During August 2013, we completed the issuance of our 6.875% Senior Notes due 2021 in the aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million (the \u201cOriginal 2021 Notes\u201d) at an issue price of 100.0%. We used $127.0 million of the net proceeds from the Original 2021 Notes offering to voluntarily prepay the entire outstanding principal amount of our Senior Secured Term Notes due 2017, of which $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount was outstanding, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. During June 2014, we completed the issuance of additional 6.875% Senior Notes due 2021 in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the \u201cSupplemental 2021 Notes\u201d) at an issue price of 102.5%, plus accrued and unpaid interest from February 15, 2014 to June 26, 2014. Collectively, the Original 2021 Notes and the Supplemental 2021 Notes are referred to herein as the \u201c2021 Notes.\u201d We have been using and expect to continue to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the Original 2021 Notes offering and the net proceeds from the Supplemental 2021 Notes offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition and development of land and home construction. Additionally, during August 2013, we entered into a four-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $75.0 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2014, we had $257.8 million of available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, the Revolving Credit Facility and our five-year $10.0 million senior secured loan with Stonegate Bank (the \u201cStonegate Loan\u201d). See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nOur board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and the Company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. As a means of sustaining our long-term financial health and limiting our exposure to unforeseen dislocations in the debt and financing markets, we currently expect to remain conservatively capitalized. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws do not contain a limitation on the amount of debt that we may incur and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our shareholders, subject to the covenants contained in our existing debt agreements.\nOur use of debt capital could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would adversely affect us, including the risk that:\n\u2022\nour cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt, which would likely result in an acceleration of such debt;\n\u2022\nour debt may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nour debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurances that investment yields will increase with higher financing costs;\n\u2022\nour debt may limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund real estate inventories, capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations and capital expenditures, future investment opportunities or other purposes.\nIf we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at maturity, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancings, increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of our assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses. To the extent we cannot meet any future debt service obligations, we will risk losing some or all of our assets that may be pledged to secure our obligations to foreclosure. Certain of our debt agreements have, and any additional debt agreements that we enter into in the future may contain, specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving holders of certain debt the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, certain of our current debt has, and any additional debt we subsequently incur may have, a floating rate of interest. Higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our current floating rate debt and on any floating rate debt we subsequently incur, and could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes.\nIf we cannot obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, our ability to operate may be restricted.\nWe use letters of credit and surety bonds (performance and financial) to guarantee our performance under various land development and construction agreements, land purchase obligations, escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other arrangements, primarily with governmental authorities. Under Florida law, we also need surety bonds to use homebuyers\u2019 escrowed deposits for construction purposes, unless homebuyers waive their escrow rights. As of December 31, 2014, we had $2.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. Our performance and financial bonds, which totaled $37.7 million as of December 31, 2014, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately one to five years or longer, depending on, among other things, the pace of development. Our estimated exposure on the outstanding performance and financial bonds as of December 31, 2014 was $21.7 million, primarily based on development remaining to be completed. Our ability to obtain additional letters of credit and surety bonds primarily depends on our credit rating, capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and certain external factors, including the capacity of the markets for such financial instruments. We must also fully indemnify providers of surety bonds. Letters of credit and surety bond providers consider these factors in addition to our performance and claims record and provider-specific underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. If banks were to decline to issue letters of credit or surety companies were to decline to issue performance and financial bonds, or if we are required to provide credit enhancement, such as cash deposits, our ability to operate could be significantly restricted, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing to fund our operations or expand our business and if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or such financing is obtained on adverse terms, we may not be able to operate or expand our business as planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.\nOur access to additional third-party sources of financing will depend, in part, on:\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perception of our growth potential;\n\u2022\nwith respect to acquisition and/or development financing, the market\u2019s perception of the value of the land parcels to be acquired and/or developed;\n\u2022\nour debt levels;\n\u2022\nour expected results of operations;\n\u2022\nour cash flow; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock.\nThe homebuilding industry is capital-intensive and we incur significant costs in the early stages of our projects to acquire land parcels and begin development. In addition, if housing markets are not favorable or permitting and development takes longer than anticipated, we may be required to hold our investments in land for extended periods of time. Additionally, domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility, uncertainty and a tightening of liquidity in both the debt and equity capital markets. Credit spreads for major sources of capital widened significantly during the U.S. credit crisis as investors demanded a higher risk premium. Given the recent volatility in the capital and credit markets, potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees to obtain financing. Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit market to attract financing on reasonable terms.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned expenditures for land acquisitions, development and construction will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand through acquisitions or organic growth faster than anticipated, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business.\nBased on our current operations, recent capital raising activities and anticipated growth, we believe that we can meet our cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2015 with existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities (including sales of homes and land). To a large extent, though, our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We can provide no assurances that our business will generate cash flow from operating activities in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels or we incur unforeseen capital expenditures and/or make investments to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, as necessary, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities or divesting assets or operations. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we do raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt, we will incur increased debt service costs and may become subject to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We may also choose to raise additional funds through equity, which would result in dilution to existing shareholders. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow, refinance our debt or incur additional debt on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition and could cause us to be unable to service our debt and may delay or prevent the expansion of our business or otherwise require us to forego market opportunities.\nOur ability to obtain third-party financing may be negatively affected by any downgrade of our credit rating by a rating agency.\nOur corporate credit rating and the rating of the 2021 Notes affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital, especially debt. We consider the availability of third-party financing to be a key component of our long-term strategy to grow our business. As such, a portion of our future access to capital may be through the issuance of notes and other debt securities. Downgrades in our corporate credit rating or the rating of the 2021 Notes could: (i) make it difficult for us to sell debt securities in the future; (ii) result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates with regard to any debt securities that we may issue in the future; and (iii) otherwise impair our ability to obtain financing on terms that are favorable to us. Each of these circumstances could adversely impact our business and future operations.\nOur indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe indenture governing the 2021 Notes, the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the senior loan agreement governing the Stonegate Loan restrict, and any debt we incur in the future will likely restrict, our ability to take specific actions even if we believe that such actions may be in our best interests. These include, but are not limited to, covenants (financial and otherwise) generally affecting our ability, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions on capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to WCI;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nsell assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nAdditionally, the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary affirmative covenants and certain financial maintenance covenants, including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a covenant requiring either minimum liquidity or maintenance of a consolidated interest coverage ratio according to a schedule set forth in such credit agreement.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these covenants (financial or otherwise) or restrictions, we could be in default under our existing debt arrangements or any other future financing arrangement we enter into. This circumstance would permit the holders of the 2021 Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility or Stonegate Bank to take certain actions, including declaring the 2021 Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility or the Stonegate Loan, as applicable, due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the 2021 Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Stonegate Loan or any other future financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets, in particular our liquid assets, may be insufficient to repay our indebtedness. A default could also significantly limit our financing alternatives, which could cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or dispose of assets when we otherwise would not choose to do so. The occurrence of any default could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nBecause of their significant stock ownership, our principal shareholders have substantial influence over our business, and their interests may differ from our interests or those of our other shareholders.\nAs of February 25, 2015, Monarch Alternative Capital LP and certain of its affiliates (collectively, \u201cMonarch\u201d) and Stonehill Institutional Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, \u201cStonehill,\u201d and together with Monarch, the \u201cPrincipal Investors\u201d) owned approximately 27.8% and 25.7% of our common stock, respectively. Due to their ownership, the Principal Investors have the power to control us and our subsidiaries, including the power to elect a majority of our directors, agree to sell or otherwise transfer a controlling stake in us and determine the outcome of all actions requiring a majority shareholder approval. Additionally, pursuant to stockholders agreements that we entered into with each of the Principal Investors in connection with the completion of an initial public offering of 6,819,091 shares of our common stock during July 2013 (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d), for so long as a Principal Investor holds at least 60% of the shares of our common stock held by it at the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, such Principal Investor has the right to nominate two directors to our board of directors and one director to each board committee (subject to applicable independence requirements of each committee). When a Principal Investor owns less than 60%, but at least 20%, of the shares of our common stock held by it at the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, such Principal Investor is entitled to nominate one director to our board of directors and each board committee (subject to applicable independence requirements of each committee). As of February 25, 2015, each of the Principal Investors held more than 60% of the shares of our common stock held by it at the consummation of our Initial Public Offering. Under the stockholders agreements, we also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary and desirable actions within our control to cause the election, removal and replacement of such directors in accordance with the stockholders agreements and applicable law. Each Principal Investor also has agreed to vote for the other\u2019s board nominees in accordance with the terms of a separate voting agreement between the Principal Investors.\nThe interests of the Principal Investors may differ from our interests or those of our other shareholders and the concentration of control in the Principal Investors will limit other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of the Principal Investors may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third-party or other change of control of the Company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support, even if such actions are in the best interests of our other shareholders. Therefore, the concentration of voting power among the Principal Investors may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. We may also take actions that our other shareholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe share price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as quarterly variations in our results of operations, changes in government regulations, the announcement of new contracts and acquisitions by us or our competitors, general market conditions specific to the homebuilding industry, changes in general economic and political conditions, volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates, threatened or actual litigation and government investigations, an adverse market reaction to the level of our indebtedness, the addition or departure of key personnel, actions taken by our shareholders, including the sale or disposition of their shares of our common stock, speculation in the press or investment community, changes in accounting principles, differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts and changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections. These and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFurthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we are eligible to take advantage of exemptions from certain reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, allowing less than five years of selected financial data in Item 6 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our elections, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which require that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition, and the rules and regulations implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. The aforementioned reporting requirements and obligations increase after a registrant is no longer deemed to be an emerging growth company. As a public company, we are required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic reports and other shareholder communications in compliance with federal securities laws and NYSE rules;\n\u2022\nhave expanded the roles and duties of our board of directors and committees thereof;\n\u2022\nhave a nominating committee;\n\u2022\nhave internal audit functions;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;\n\u2022\nmaintain new internal policies, including those relating to trading in our securities, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside legal counsel, accountants and consultants in the activities listed above;\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022\nretain additional personnel;\n\u2022\ncomply with NYSE listing standards; and\n\u2022\ncomply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Currently, we are unable to estimate or otherwise quantify these future costs with any degree of certainty. However, the expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically in recent years and we do not expect that that trend will significantly change. A number of these requirements have, and will require us to continue to, carry out activities we have not done previously as a private company and complying with such requirements may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This environment could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the intentions of regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nComplying with all of the requirements of being a public company has increased our general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. In the future, we may utilize funds to pay such public company expenses that would otherwise be used to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives. Additionally, we expect that it may be difficult and expensive to maintain director and officer liability insurance and, accordingly, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nThe failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the standards of publicly traded companies as promulgated under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404(a)\u201d). As such, we completed the necessary evaluative procedures during the year ended December 31, 2014 and issued our annual report on internal control over financial reporting, which can be found in Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and, if necessary, remediation.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we reviewed, documented and tested our internal control over financial reporting based on the requirements of Section 404(a) and interpretive guidance thereunder. In the future, we may encounter problems or delays when implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any required improvements and receiving a favorable attestation report in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the price of our common stock could decline.\nMoreover, the existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote considerable time and incur significant costs to remediate any such matter. Moreover, management may not be able to remediate any identified material weakness or significant deficiency in a timely manner. The existence of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could require us to restate such financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, each of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent an acquisition of the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, and could make it more difficult for shareholders to change our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority shareholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents shareholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without the approval of our shareholders, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining the approval of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on shareholder action by written consent, which forces shareholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nno requirement that a special meeting of shareholders be called at the request of shareholders, other than at the request of either of the Principal Investors, so long as one of them or both together hold at least 10% of our outstanding shares, which may delay the ability of our shareholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that shareholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe have also opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cSection 203\u201d), which regulates corporate takeovers. However, our charter contains provisions that are similar to Section 203. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may not engage in certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a three-year period following the time that the person became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u2022\nprior to the time that person became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nupon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the Company outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n\u2022\nat or subsequent to the time the person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nGenerally, a business combination includes a merger, consolidation, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with that person\u2019s affiliates and associates, owns, or within the previous three years owned, 15% or more of our voting stock. However, in our case, the Principal Investors and any of their affiliates and subsidiaries and any of their direct or indirect transferees receiving 15% or more of our voting stock will not be deemed to be interested stockholders regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them and, accordingly, will not be subject to such restrictions. This provision could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire the Company.\nThe provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees, as determined by our board of directors. Under the terms of such indemnification agreements, we are required to indemnify each of our directors and officers, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, if the basis of the indemnitee\u2019s involvement was by reason of the fact that the indemnitee is or was a director, or officer, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or was serving at the Company\u2019s request in an official capacity for another entity. We must indemnify our officers and directors against all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs of any type or nature whatsoever, including any and all expenses and obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness or participate in any completed, actual, pending or threatened action, lawsuit, claim or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, or establishing or enforcing a right to indemnification under the indemnification agreement. The indemnification agreements also require us, if so requested, to advance within 30 days of such request all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs that such director or officer incurred, provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us. Our amended and restated bylaws also require that such person return any advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us. Any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock may be sold into the market at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of February 25, 2015, we had 26,106,196 shares of outstanding common stock. All shares of our common stock sold in the Initial Public Offering are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), except for any shares that are held or acquired by our affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act.\nShareholders holding 13,964,121 shares of our common stock as of February 25, 2015, or approximately 53.5% of our outstanding common stock, have the right, subject to various conditions and limitations, to include their shares of our common stock in registration statements relating to our securities, including our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200330) that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 1, 2014 (the \u201cShelf Registration Statement\u201d). If the offer and sale of these shares are registered, they will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Shares of common stock sold under such registration statements can be freely sold in the public market. In the event such registration rights are exercised and a large number of shares of common stock are sold in the public market, such sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nUnder certain employee stock-based incentive compensation plans that we adopted during 2013 (the \u201c2013 Plans\u201d), we are authorized to issue up to 2,987,000 shares of our common stock. We registered all such shares under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-8. These shares, once issued and released from any restrictions thereon, will be able to be freely sold in the public market, subject to sale limitations contained in the 2013 Plans, as applicable, Rule 10b5-1 sales plans, if any, and volume limitations applicable to affiliates under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. As of February 25, 2015, 1,200,740 shares of our common stock were subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plans and 1,756,598 shares of common stock were reserved and available for issuance under such plans. Furthermore, we also have 758,399 shares of our common stock reserved and available for issuance under our Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2010 Equity Plan\u201d); however, given our recent adoption of the 2013 Plans, we do not currently expect to make any further grants under the 2010 Equity Plan. For further discussion of our employee stock-based incentive compensation plans, see Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn the future, we may also issue common stock or other securities if we need to raise additional capital. The number of new shares of our common stock issued in connection with raising additional capital could constitute a material portion of the then outstanding shares of our common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities, in each case, in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act or pursuant to registration statements relating to our securities, including the Shelf Registration Statement. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both, and may result in future limitations under Section 382 that could reduce the rate at which we utilize our NOL carryforwards. Preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments, or both, that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, if any, and holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their ownership interests in the Company.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future. Sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock in the future could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in future transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such future transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain our future earnings, if any, in order to reinvest in the development and growth of our business and, therefore, we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Additionally, under the indenture governing the 2021 Notes, the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility and any other future financing arrangement we enter into, we may be unable to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. Accordingly, shareholders may need to sell their shares of our common stock to realize a return on their investment and they may not be able to sell those shares at or above the price they paid for them.\nIf securities analysts do not publish favorable reports about the Company or if we, or our industry, are the subject of unfavorable commentary, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports about the Company that are published by financial and market analysts. Such analysts could issue negative commentary about the Company or our industry, or they could downgrade our common stock. We may also be unable to ensure that the Company receives sufficient research coverage and has visibility in the market. As a result of any of these factors, the price of our common stock may decline.\nNon-U.S. holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gains realized from the sale or other disposition of our common stock.\nDue to our holdings in U.S. real property interests, we believe that we currently are, and will continue to remain being for the foreseeable future, a \u201cU.S. real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on a sale or other disposition of our common stock, unless our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (such as the NYSE) and such non-U.S. holder did not actually or constructively own more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of (i) the five-year period preceding the date of the sale or other disposition and (ii) the non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in such common stock. In addition, a 10% withholding tax could apply to the gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder if our common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market. A non-U.S. holder also will be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for any taxable year in which it realizes a gain from the sale or other disposition of our common stock that is subject to U.S. federal income tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of our common stock. For purposes of this paragraph, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of our common stock that is an individual, corporation, trust or estate that is not a \u201cUnited States person\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.", "PERMNO": 89347, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "WCIC"}
