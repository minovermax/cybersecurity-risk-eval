{"cik": "1638287", "company": "NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as in any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information contained in this report, including our financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to our Operations and to Development, Marketing, Commercialization and Regulation of Our Product Candidates\nWe have incurred losses since inception, we anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the full one-year period following the date of this report. We require additional financing to accomplish our long-term business plan and failure to obtain necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception and have an accumulated deficit of $36.9 million as of December 31, 2019. It is possible we will never generate revenue or profit.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.9 million. Operating at the level of scientific activity described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Statements and Results of Operations - Overview - Recent Developments - Current Scientific Activity; Repurposing of NB-01\u201d, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund operations through the end of December 2020. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional capital to fund continued operations at the current level beyond 2020. We have some ability to reduce costs further in 2020 by further curtailing the level of scientific activity planned for 2020, thereby potentially lengthening our operational window into the first quarter of 2021.\nAlthough we are exploring financing opportunities and carefully monitoring the capital markets, we do not yet have any commitments for additional financing and may not be successful in our efforts to raise additional funds. There can be no assurances that additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital (which is not assured at this time, particularly as a result of recent depressed capital market conditions), our long-term business plan may not be accomplished, and we may be forced to cease, reduce, or delay operations. For more information about our liquidity and capital resources, see Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe foregoing factors individually and collectively raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the full one-year period following the date of this report. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Statements and Results of Operations - Overview - Recent Developments - Going Concern\u201d and \u201cGoing Concern\u201d under Note 1 to our audited financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, investors could lose all or part of their investment in our Company.\nWe have determined to postpone the initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials of NB-01 under present circumstances and we have terminated all of our agreements with contract research organizations related to NB-01. We may not be able to successfully develop NB-01 pursuant to other alternatives, including as an orphan drug or as a nutraceutical candidate.\nNB-01 has successfully completed two Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trials for PDN. However, in light of the present business environment including the impact of the COVID-19 disease that emerged in December 2019 as a global pandemic, we have determined that any attempt to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials for NB-01, as previously announced, would be difficult if not impossible in the short or medium term. To conserve financial resources, in the first quarter of 2020 we directed our contract research organization (\u201cCRO\u201d) partners and other vendors working on the Phase 3 clinical trials of NB-01, including Syneos Health, to cease all work and we gave notice of termination of our existing contract arrangements with each of them.\nWe are currently re-evaluating alternatives to bring the NB-01 asset to the market through a different regulatory pathway. Development of NB-01 as an orphan drug is among the alternatives we are considering, and we may conduct feasibility studies to identify a rare disease relevant to NB-01. Additionally, we are considering marketing the NB-01 product line as nutraceutical (non-pharmaceutical) products. There is no assurance that we will be able to pursue either alternative for NB-01.\nOur ability to successfully develop NB-01 as an orphan drug would be subject to the following additional risks, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe results from different types of animal models could be inconsistent from the previous data we have;\n\u00b7\na limited number of potential participants could make clinical trials for NB-01 difficult;\n\u00b7\ndisparate locations of a limited number of potential participants could make clinical trials difficult; and\n\u00b7\nbatch-by-batch consistency is difficult to achieve in clinical trials with small numbers of participants.\nOur ability to successfully develop NB-01 as a nutraceutical product would be subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe future growth and profitability of NB-01 would depend in large part upon our ability to successfully hire personnel with requisite marketing expertise, the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing efforts and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to market and advertise;\n\u00b7\nour inability to properly manage, motivate and retain third party distributors for NB-01, as applicable, could have a material adverse effect on us;\n\u00b7\nthe success of NB-01 would likely be linked to the size and growth rate of the vitamin, mineral and dietary supplement market, and an adverse change in the size or growth rate of that market could have a material adverse effect on us; and\n\u00b7\nunfavorable publicity or consumer perception of NB-01 and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to successfully obtain regulatory or marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, any of our product candidates.\nAlthough we currently have no drug product for sale and may never be able to develop marketable drug products, our business depends heavily on the successful clinical development (for our pharmaceutical drug products), regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug candidates.\nThe clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals\nfor the commercial sale of any product candidate as a pharmaceutical product, we must successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones, including:\n\uf0b7\ndeveloping dosages that will be well-tolerated, safe and effective;\n\uf0b7\ncompleting the development and scale-up to permit manufacture of our product candidates in commercial quantities and at acceptable costs;\n\uf0b7\ndemonstrating through pivotal clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective in patients for the intended indication;\n\uf0b7\nestablishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; and\n\uf0b7\nobtaining and maintaining exclusive rights, including patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity for our product candidates.\nThe time necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product candidate is long and uncertain, and we may not successfully complete these milestones for any product candidates that we may develop.\nWe have not yet completed development of any product candidate. Moreover, both NB-01 and NB-02 are considered a \u201cbotanical drug product\u201d by the FDA, which results in the drug candidate having unique features that must be taken into account during the drug development process. Botanical drug products may be heterogeneous in nature and may carry additional uncertainty about their active constituents in comparison to synthetic small-molecule drug products. Accordingly, the FDA may impose additional requirements on us in order to confirm that the final formulation of NB-01 or NB-02 is able to demonstrate the necessary therapeutic consistency to support the marketing of a safe and effective commercial drug product. The complexities of developing botanical drug products may increase the time and costs associated with the development of our product candidates.\nIn August 2018, the FDA, following submission of a two-year carcinogenicity study, requested additional preclinical studies, including a 13-week PPAR-alpha knockout mouse study with Gemcabene. The FDA stated that there could be no progression to the EOP2 meeting or commencement of the Phase 3 trials, which require more than 6 months of drug exposure, until the partial clinical hold was lifted. This request delayed the timeline for the EOP2 meeting and start of a Phase 3 trial by more than one and a half years. We are currently conducting all preclinical studies requested for resubmission of our application to the FDA to lift the clinical hold. We cannot assure you that the studies will be completed on time by third party vendors who are involved or that the results will prove satisfactory for the FDA to lift the hold. It is possible that the FDA may request additional studies and information prior to lifting the hold which would significantly delay the time and cost to initiating Phase 3 trials and future development of Gemcabene. If the FDA decisions further delay our clinical plans, this could jeopardize our ability to commercialize Gemcabene by April 2024, as required by the Pfizer Agreement. Finally, we cannot assure you that the partial clinical hold will ever be lifted, in which case Gemcabene will never receive NDA approval or be commercialized.\nWe are continuing to test and develop our product candidates and may explore possible design or formulation changes to address safety, efficacy, manufacturing efficiency and performance issues to the extent any arise. The design of a clinical trial may be able to determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. There is no assurance that we will be able to design and complete a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to multiple interpretations and analyses. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have experienced significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials.\nWe may not be able to complete development of any product candidates that demonstrate safety and efficacy and that will have a commercially reasonable treatment and storage period. If we are unable to complete development of NB-01, NB-02, Gemcabene or any other product candidates that we may develop, we will not be able to commercialize and earn revenue from them.\nThe regulatory review and approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, including pursuant to the guidelines applicable to NB-01 and NB-02 as botanical drug products, and the guidelines applicable to Gemcabene, our business will be substantially harmed.\nOf the large number of drugs in development in the United States, only a small percentage receive FDA regulatory approval and are commercialized in the United States. We are not permitted to market NB-01, NB-02, Gemcabene or any other product candidate as a pharmaceutical drug in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries or jurisdictions, such as the marketing authorization application, or MAA, in the European Union from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.\nSuccessfully completing clinical trials and obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the FDA, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, may delay, limit or deny approval of an NDA for many reasons, including, among others:\n\uf0b7\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\ndisagreement with the sufficiency of our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\nfailure to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the proposed indications;\n\uf0b7\nfailure to demonstrate that any clinical and other benefits of the product candidate outweigh their safety risks;\n\uf0b7\na negative interpretation of the data from our nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\uf020\ndeficiencies in the manufacturing or control processes or failure of third-party manufacturing facilities with which our contracts for clinical and commercial supplies to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs;\n\uf0b7\uf020\ndeficiencies in the harvesting and processing of botanical raw materials under Good Agricultural and Collection Processes, or GACPs, or the inability to demonstrate that the final product is capable of being therapeutically consistent, as applicable to botanical drug products, as applicable;\n\uf0b7\uf020\ninsufficient data collected from clinical trials or changes in the approval requirements that render our nonclinical and clinical data insufficient to support the filing of an NDA or to obtain regulatory approval; or\n\uf0b7\uf020\nchanges in clinical practice in or approved products available for the treatment of the target patient population that could have an impact on the indications that we are pursuing for our product candidates.\nFurther, the FDA has specific requirements and technical standards for botanical drugs, with which we will be obliged to comply in the clinical development of NB-01 and NB-02 as pharmaceutical drugs, including with respect to the quality and therapeutic consistency standards for the product candidate that will be used in clinical trials. We cannot assure you that it will be able to meet the standards to which it will be held for these purposes.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may also require more information, including additional nonclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or cause us to abandon the development program. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, our product candidates may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than we request, such approval may be contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or we may not be allowed to include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of such product candidate.\nOur profits from Gemcabene sales will be limited pursuant to our CVR obligations, and we therefore, may, at any time and in our sole and absolute discretion, discontinue any and all further efforts to develop, divest or otherwise monetize Gemcabene.\nWe have agreed to commit up to $1 million to support the further development of Gemcabene through the quarter ending March 31, 2020 (the \u201cCovenant End Date\u201d). We do not have any obligation to develop Gemcabene, or to expend any funds or efforts with respect to Gemcabene, other than the aforementioned commitment, to fund, (i) a toxicity study, (ii) a related FDA submission designed to result in the release of the partial clinical hold with respect to Gemcabene, (iii) preparation for an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA, and (iv) consulting costs for up to four former Gemphire employees to support such activities. The expected cost of such activities is based on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate.\nOur profits from Gemcabene sales will be limited pursuant to our CVR obligations. Under the terms of the CVR Agreement, CVR holders are entitled to 80% of the Gross Consideration (as defined in the CVR Agreement) received from the grant, sale or transfer of rights to Gemcabene.\nIf $1 million is insufficient to fund the matters set forth above, we do not have any obligation to provide further funding. We may, at any time and in our sole and absolute discretion, discontinue any and all further efforts to develop, divest or otherwise monetize Gemcabene.\nThe Phase 2a clinical trial of Gemcabene in Pediatric NAFLD was terminated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the principal investigator following the occurrence of unanticipated problems. This trial termination and the unanticipated problems could have negative impacts on the clinical development of Gemcabene.\nOn August 10, 2018, the DSMB at Emory University School of Medicine overseeing the non-company, investigator-led open label Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial evaluating Gemcabene in pediatric patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (\u201cNAFLD\u201d) recommended that the trial be terminated due to unanticipated problems. Data on the first three patients who underwent 12 weeks of treatment showed that all three experienced an increase in liver fat content, as measured by MRI-PDFF. Two of the three patients also demonstrated increases in ALT; however, their baseline ALT levels were elevated prior to receiving Gemcabene. The increase in liver fat was deemed an unanticipated problem by the trial investigator because it was an unexpected consistent pattern of worsening of the disease, rather than improvement, creating risk to the patients, which the investigator believed was likely due to the drug. Six subjects had received study medication when the study was halted. Additional data that came to light subsequently showed that during the trial none of the three patients were fully compliant with taking Gemcabene and their life styles could have potentially impacted the findings. Subjects were instructed to self-administer the test-agent daily; however, compliance was significantly compromised as assessed by return of unused tablets and measurement of blood drug levels. All six subjects gained weight and had increased TGs during study treatment. In support of non-compliance, these findings are inconsistent with other Gemcabene trials, and as such, the risk for increased liver fat with Gemcabene treatment is unknown at this time. The six subjects who received Gemcabene were followed in a 12-month safety monitoring period post final-dose, which is now complete. During this follow-on reporting period there were no drug related adverse events reported. There was one serious non-related adverse event of hospitalization of subacute spinal cord infarction/embolism. No deaths or other SAEs were reported.\nWe cannot assure you that the unanticipated problems observed in the pediatric NAFLD trial will not be seen in future trials nor that serious adverse events (SAEs) will not occur in future trials. We also cannot assure you that the unanticipated problems observed in the pediatric NAFLD trial will not result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities requesting additional analyses of previously completed clinical trials, including the three Phase 2b trials in dyslipidemia completed in 2017 and 2018.\nIf Gemcabene is associated with adverse effects or undesirable side effects in preclinical testing or clinical trials or has characteristics that are unexpected in preclinical testing or clinical trials, Gemcabene could be less attractive to potential collaborators.\nProduct candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their marketing approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any, including marketing withdrawal.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates that we may develop or acquire could cause us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt our clinical trials and could result in more restrictive labels or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of such product candidates. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. In addition, any drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of patients, rare and severe side effects of our product candidates may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate. If our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by such product candidates (or any other similar drugs) after such approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\uf0b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approval of such product candidates;\n\uf0b7\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \"boxed\" warning or a contraindication;\n\uf0b7\nwe may be required to recall the product, change the way such product candidates are distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product candidates;\n\uf0b7\nregulatory authorities may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides to be distributed to patients, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools;\n\uf0b7\nwe may be subject to regulatory investigations and government enforcement actions;\n\uf0b7\nwe may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\uf0b7\nwe may decide to remove such product candidates from the marketplace after they are approved;\n\uf0b7\nthe product may be rendered less competitive and sales may decrease;\n\uf0b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for injury caused to individuals exposed to or taking its product candidates; and\n\uf0b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nWe believe that any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidates and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates, if approved, and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.\nDelays in our clinical trials may lead to a delay in the submission of marketing approval applications and jeopardize our ability to potentially receive approvals and generate revenues from the sale of our products.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time, need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\uf0b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\uf0b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n\uf0b7\ninability, delay or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in competing clinical trial programs;\n\uf0b7\nissues with the manufacture of drug substance for use in clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\ndelay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\uf0b7\ndelay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\uf0b7\nclinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\uf0b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\uf0b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n\uf0b7\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, if any;\n\uf0b7\nambiguous or negative results;\n\uf0b7\ndecision by the FDA, a comparable foreign regulatory authority, or recommendation by a DSMB to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\uf0b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the product development program; or\n\uf0b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or requirements.\nAny delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe development of NB-01 is dependent upon securing sufficient quantities of Dioscorea Rhizome and Dioscoreae Nipponicae Rhizoma, which are two plant species native to China.\nThe therapeutic components of our product candidate, NB-01, consists of Dioscorea Rhizome and Dioscoreae Nipponicae Rhizoma, which are cultivated in China and Korea. We currently secure these components exclusively from Dong-A ST. Our current supply agreement with Dong-A ST expires on September 28, 2023, unless extended by our mutual agreement with Dong-A ST. There can be no assurances that Dioscorea Rhizome and Dioscoreae Nipponicae Rhizoma will continue to grow in sufficient quantities to meet commercial supply requirements or that the countries from which we can secure Dioscorea Rhizome and Dioscoreae Nipponicae Rhizoma will continue to allow the exportation of these components. In the event we are no longer able to obtain these products from Dong-A ST, or in sufficient quantities, we may not be able to produce our proposed products and our business will be adversely affected.\nFurther, because Dioscorea Rhizome and Dioscoreae Nipponicae Rhizoma are imported from China and Korea, any trade policies or rules that impose conditions or restrictions on the importation of natural products from those regions may restrict or prevent the timely delivery of these products to us, which would adversely affect our business. We may also have difficulty importing these products as a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. See the risk factor below entitled \u201cOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, if approved, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our drug discovery process. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than it may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and entering into strategic transactions, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nNB-01 and NB-02\nThere are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and for the symptomatic and disease modifying treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nNB-01 has been in clinical development for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. We are also developing NB-02 for the symptomatic and disease modifying treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies. For painful diabetic neuropathy, there are no products currently marketed for disease modification, although there are products available to treat painful diabetic neuropathy. For Alzheimer's disease, current symptomatic treatments have limited effectiveness and no disease-modifying therapy is currently available. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products.\nGemcabene\nFor Gemcabene, the lipid-lowering therapies market is highly competitive, dynamic and dominated by the sale of statin treatments including the cheaper generic versions of statins. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain a share of the market for our planned indications. Other pharmaceutical companies may develop lipid-lowering therapies for the same indications that compete with Gemcabene, if approved, that do not infringe the claims of our patents, pending patent applications or other proprietary rights, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Lipid-lowering therapies currently on the market that would compete with Gemcabene, if approved, are referenced in \u201cItem 1 - Business-Competition-Gemcabene\u201d above.\nThis means that there is significant competition for investigational sites and patients to enroll in clinical studies. Additionally, since some drug candidates may be further along in development, approval of such drug candidates could lead to the FDA and other global health authorities to request and/or require changes to ongoing or future clinical trial designs that could impact timelines and cost.\nThe biomarkers and pathogenesis of NASH are less understood than the dyslipidemia market and for that reason there are many mechanisms of action under investigation to better understand how to effectively treat the disease. Currently accepted diagnosis of NASH is confirmed through a liver biopsy which is invasive, time consuming and costly. Future growth and evolution of the NASH market may rely on development of less invasive technologies to increase diagnoses rates to broaden the drug treated patient population. Several companies have late stage assets (Phase 3 or outcomes studies) well under way with projected market approval dates in NASH as soon as 2020/2021. For NASH, the market is currently evolving with no approved therapies for the indication across the globe. Current thought leader opinions are pointing to a multiple mechanistic approach to effectively treat NASH.\nSeveral pharmaceutical companies have NASH therapies in development that may be approved for marketing in the United States or outside of the United States. Based on publicly available information, we believe the current therapies in development that would compete with Gemcabene in NASH include but are not limited to:\n\uf0b7\nOCALIVA (Obeticholic Acid) (FXR Agonist) being developed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;\n\uf0b7\nElafibranor (PPAR Agonist) being developed by Genfit SA;\n\uf0b7\nSelonsertib (formerly GS-4997) (ASK1 Inhibitor) being developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc.;\n\uf0b7\nGS-0976 (ACC Inhibitor) being developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc.;\n\uf0b7\nGS-9674 (FXR Agonist) being developed by Gilead;\n\uf0b7\nCenicriviroc (CVC) (CCR2/CCR5 Inhibitor) being developed by Tobira Therapeutics, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc);\n\uf0b7\nAKR-001 being developed by Akero Therapeutics;\n\uf0b7\nNGM-282 being developed by MGM Biopharmaceuticals;\n\uf0b7\nPXL-770 being developed by Poxel;\n\uf0b7\nEDP-305 being developed by Enanta;\n\uf0b7\nAramchol (Synthetic Fatty Acid/Bile Acid Conjugate) being developed by Galmed;\n\uf0b7\nMN-001 (5-Lipoxygenase Inhibitor) being developed by MediciNova;\n\uf0b7\nVK2809 (THR-Beta Agonist) being developed by Viking;\n\uf0b7\nBMS-986036 (GFG21) being developed by BMS;\n\uf0b7\nLanifibranor (PPAR Pan Agonist) being developed by Inventiva;\n\uf0b7\nGR-MD-02 (Galectin-3 Inhibitor) being developed by Galectin Therapeutics; and\n\uf0b7\nMGL-3196 (THR Agonist) being developed by Madrigal.\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among hospitals, physicians, patients and healthcare payors.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future, the product may not gain market acceptance among hospitals, physicians, health care payors, patients and the medical community. Market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nacceptance by major operators of hospitals, physicians and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment, particularly the ability of our product candidates to establish themselves as a new standard of care in the treatment paradigm for the indications that we are pursuing;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments as compared to the relative costs of the product candidates and alternative treatments;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe, and patients to take, a product candidate that is based on a botanical source;\n\uf0b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects with respect to our product candidates, and any elements that may be imposed by the FDA under a REMS program that could discourage market uptake of the products;\n\uf0b7\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing for any approved products by third party payors and government authorities;\n\uf0b7\uf020\ninability of certain types of patients to take our product;\n\uf0b7\uf020\ndemonstrated ability to treat patients and, if required by any applicable regulatory authority in connection with the approval for target indications, to provide patients with incremental cardiovascular disease benefits, as compared with other available therapies;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates, including as compared with other treatments available for approved indications;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nlimitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the FDA;\n\uf0b7\uf020\navailability of alternative treatments already approved or expected to be commercially launched in the near future;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategies;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nguidelines and recommendations of organizations involved in research, treatment and prevention of various diseases that may advocate for alternative therapies;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nphysicians or patients may be reluctant to switch from existing therapies even if potentially more effective, safe or convenient;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nefficacy, safety, and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe ability to offer our product for sale at competitive prices;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nany restrictions on the use of our product together with other medications;\n\uf0b7\uf020\ninteractions of our product with other medicines patients are taking; and\n\uf0b7\uf020\nthe timing of market introduction of our products as well as competitive products.\nThere may be delays in getting our product candidates, if approved, on hospital or insurance formularies or limitations on coverages that may be available in the early stages of commercialization for newly approved drugs. If any of our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among hospitals, physicians, patients or health care payors, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to commercialize a future pharmaceutical drug candidate, the profitability of such product candidate will likely depend in significant part on third-party reimbursement practices, which, if unfavorable, would harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize a drug successfully will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if coverage is available, whether the level of reimbursement will be adequate. Assuming we obtain coverage for our product candidates, if approved, by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use a product candidate, if approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a product candidate is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers its costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for a new product, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost medicines and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of medicines from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. However, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nOur inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have an adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidate that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any product that we may develop including any nutraceuticals. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others selling or\notherwise coming into contact with any of our products or future product candidate during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. For example, we may be sued on allegations that a product candidate caused injury or that the product is otherwise unsuitable. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, including as a result of interactions with alcohol or other drugs, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nNutraceuticals are classified as food ingredients, dietary supplements, or natural health products, and, in most cases, are not necessarily subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. However, if we pursue nutraceutical products, we may, in the future, be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, claims alleging inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances.\nIf we cannot successfully defend against claims that our product caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\uf0b7\ndecreased demand for any product candidate that we are developing;\n\uf0b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\uf0b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\uf0b7\nincreased FDA warnings on product labels;\n\uf0b7\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\uf0b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\uf0b7\ndistraction of management's attention from our primary business;\n\uf0b7\nloss of revenue;\n\uf0b7\nthe inability to commercialize any product candidate that we may develop;\n\uf0b7\nthe removal of a product from the market; and\n\uf0b7\uf020\nincreased insurance costs.\nWe do not currently maintain clinical trial insurance coverage for clinical trials. Even if we obtain such insurance in the future, it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have an adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by us and our third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States and abroad governing laboratory procedures and the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers' procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities to market and sell our product candidates, if they are approved for such marketing, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nIn order to market and sell our product candidates in development, we currently intend to build and develop our own sales, marketing and distribution operations. Although our management team has previous experience with such efforts for pharmaceutical products, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in building these operations. The establishment and development of our own commercial sales and marketing teams to discuss any products we may develop will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch.\nIf we decide to pursue NB-01 as a nutraceutical product, its success will depend significantly on sales and marketing activities. None of our management team has experience with nutraceutical marketing. Accordingly, our future ability to achieve sales and profits for NB-01 as a nutraceutical product would depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel with sales and marketing expertise. There is a risk that we will be unable to attract, train, retain or motivate such qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and the failure to do so may severely damage our prospects.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. We will also be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. If any of our product candidates are approved, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIf, in the future, we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or to selectively enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product for which we retain sales and marketing responsibilities, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to other third parties. In the future, we may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to sell some of our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nThere are risks involved both with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates on our own include:\n\uf0b7\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\uf0b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future pharmaceutical products; and\n\uf0b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenue or the profitability of these product revenue may be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We may have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny pharmaceutical product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing and/or promotion.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\uf0b7\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\uf0b7\nrestrictions on the labeling, marketing, distribution or use of a product;\n\uf0b7\nrequirements to conduct post-approval clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\uf0b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nrecall of products;\n\uf0b7\uf020\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\uf0b7\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals for the drug products;\n\uf0b7\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\uf0b7\nproduct seizure; and\n\uf0b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nAny product marketed as a nutraceutical could also be subject to FDA review or adverse action and we could be forced to remove such product from the market.\nWe or any potential collaborator may never receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates outside of the United States.\nThe activities associated with the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical drugs are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates will prevent us or any potential collaborator from commercializing our product candidates as pharmaceutical drugs. We have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, and we do not expect to obtain FDA or any other regulatory approvals to market any of our product candidates for the foreseeable future, if at all. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved.\nWe may seek to avail ourselves of mechanisms to expedite and/or reduce the cost for development or approval of any of our product candidates or product candidates we may pursue in the future, such as fast track designation or orphan drug designation, but such mechanisms may not actually lead to a faster or less expensive development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek fast track designation, priority review, orphan drug designation, or accelerated approval for any other product candidate we may pursue in the future. For example, if a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-\nthreatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. However, the FDA has broad discretion with regard to these mechanisms, and even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for any such mechanism, it cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we obtain fast track or priority review designation or pursue an accelerated approval pathway, we may not experience a faster and/or less costly development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw a particular designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nA breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for our product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek a breakthrough designation from FDA for some of our product candidates. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. The receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to other drugs and does not assure ultimate approval of the designated product candidate by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. See the section titled \u201cItem 1 - Business-Government Regulation\u201d above.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. New legislation or regulations may adversely affect the potential for our products as nutraceuticals. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals, if any, of our product candidates may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing conditions and other requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for Gemcabene for HoFH, we will have to rely on data and marketing exclusivity for HoFH that is not based on an orphan drug designation, if any, and on our intellectual property rights.\nIn the United States, we have obtained orphan drug designation for Gemcabene for the treatment of HoFH. We may submit an application to the FDA for other orphan drug designations for Gemcabene such as for the treatment of TG greater than approximately 750 mg/dL (F) or familial partial lipodystrophy under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined, in part, as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States.\nIn the United States, the company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in very limited circumstances. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines \"same drug\" as a drug that contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially\ndefective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nThe EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. Orphan drug designation from the EMA provides ten years of marketing exclusivity following drug approval, subject to reduction to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met.\nEven if we are able to obtain and maintain orphan drug exclusivity for Gemcabene for HoFH, the designation may not effectively protect it from competition for HoFH because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Moreover, even with an orphan drug designation, the FDA can subsequently approve a different formulation of the same API for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later formulation of the API is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of its product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings, among other penalties and consequences.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions and obligations under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations are noted in the section \u201cItem 1 - Business-Government Regulation\u201d above.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair its ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations which can harm its business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and\nnational anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States to sell our products abroad and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other partners, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Our violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nOur ability to use our NOLs to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOL carryforwards, or NOLs, may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, including in connection with the Merger. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in further ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing and any future NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nWe believe that we have undergone an ownership change as a result of the Merger. We have begun, but not completed, a preliminary study to confirm whether an ownership change has occurred as a result of the Merger, but have not conducted a study to assess whether there have been multiple ownership changes since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study.\nThe comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Tax Act that significantly reforms the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation on the deductibility of interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, reduction of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. The overall impact of the Tax Act is immaterial to our business and financial condition. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. You are urged to consult with your legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives. On December 22, 2017, comprehensive changes to the Code were signed into law, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act included significant changes that could materially impact the taxation of corporations, like us, including among other things, changes to the corporate income tax rate, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to business interest income plus 30% of adjusted taxable income (except for certain small businesses), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including changes to the orphan drug tax credit and changes to the deductibility of research and experimental expenditures that will be effective in the future). The Tax Act also included a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of current year taxable income and the general elimination of carrybacks of NOLs generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) signed into law on March 27, 2020, provided that NOLs generated in a taxable\nyear beginning in 2018, 2019, or 2020, may now be carried back five years. In addition, the 80% taxable income limitation is temporarily removed, allowing NOLs to fully offset net taxable income. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act and any future tax reform is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of the Tax Act and any future tax reform on holders of our common stock is likewise uncertain and could be adverse.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Act, or on specific products that we may ultimately sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nInadequate funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which the combined organization's operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, upon completion of the merger and in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nFederal legislation and actions by state and local governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may face competition for our product candidates, if approved, from cheaper alternatives sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. The Medicare Modernization Act contains provisions that may change U.S. importation laws and expand pharmacists' and wholesalers' ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. These changes to U.S. importation laws will not take effect unless and until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has so far declined to approve a reimportation plan. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any product we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Third Parties\nWe have relied and will rely on third-party clinical research organizations (CROs) to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon CROs and clinical data management organizations to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. Although we control only certain aspects of their activities, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements and the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 requirements. We, our CROs and our clinical trial sites are required to comply with regulations and current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and comparable foreign requirements to ensure that the health, safety and rights of patients are protected in clinical trials, and that data integrity is assured. Regulatory authorities ensure compliance with GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors and trial sites. If we, any of our CROs or our clinical trial sites fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials or a specific site may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual obligations or meet expected timelines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and preclinical and clinical drug supplies.\nWe have no experience manufacturing our product candidates on a large clinical or commercial scale and have no manufacturing facility. We are currently dependent on Dong-A ST as our sole third party manufacturer for the manufacture of NB-01. We rely completely on third parties to supply and manufacture our preclinical and clinical drug supplies for Gemcabene, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of Gemcabene.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of NB-01 or Gemcabene. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently work exclusively with Dong-A ST as the sole manufacturer for the production of NB-01 and rely completely on third parties to supply and manufacture our preclinical and clinical drug supplies for Gemcabene. To meet our projected needs for clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, Dong-A ST or our other third party providers will need to provide sufficient scale of production for these projected needs. If any issues arise in the manufacturing and we are unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources, we are unable to find an alternative third party capable of reproducing the existing manufacturing method or we are unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market or distribute them.\nIn addition, under FDA's guidelines for botanical drug products, the harvesting and processing of the botanical raw materials that are the basis of our product candidates must be done in compliance with Good Agricultural and Collection Processes, or GACPs. We are relying on Dong-A ST and other third parties to ensure that their practices comply with applicable GACPs.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates and preclinical and clinical drug supplies, including:\n\uf0b7\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\uf0b7\nthe possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates or any products that we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications);\n\uf0b7\nthe possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on our own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\uf0b7\ndelay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates because of the failure by our third-party manufacturer to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes; and\n\uf0b7\ncurrent manufacturer and any future manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our product candidates at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.\nIf third-party manufacturers do not successfully carry out their contractual obligations or meet expected timelines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions or in-licenses of technology that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to the combined organization's stockholders and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we currently have no specific plans to acquire any other businesses or in-license any additional products or technology, we may, in the future, make acquisitions or licenses of, or investments in, companies, products or technologies that we believe are a strategic or commercial fit with its current product candidates and business or otherwise offer opportunities for us. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, the combined organization may:\n\uf0b7\nissue stock that would dilute its stockholders' percentage of ownership;\n\uf0b7\nexpend cash;\n\uf0b7\nincur debt and assume liabilities; and\n\uf0b7\nincur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe also may be unable to find suitable acquisition or license candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or licenses on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition or license, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. Further, future acquisitions or licenses could also pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\uf0b7\nproblems integrating the purchased or licensed business, products or technologies;\n\uf0b7\nincreases to our expenses;\n\uf0b7\nthe failure to have discovered undisclosed liabilities of the acquired or licensed asset or company;\n\uf0b7\ndiversion of management's attention from their day-to-day responsibilities;\n\uf0b7\nharm to our operating results or financial condition;\n\uf0b7\nentrance into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\uf0b7\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nWe may not be able to complete one or more acquisitions or effectively integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization\nefforts with respect to our products and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any strategic alliance or collaboration may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. Our likely collaborators include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our products or any future product candidate. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators' abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction.\nCollaborations involving or product candidates or any future product candidate pose the following risks to us:\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator's strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive;\n\uf0b7\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more product candidates may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product candidate;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\uf0b7\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidate or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\uf0b7\nwe may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in its collaborations, including if it undergoes a change of control;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators may learn about our discoveries and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future;\n\uf0b7\nthe results of collaborators' preclinical or clinical studies could harm or impair other development programs;\n\uf0b7\nthere may be conflicts between different collaborators that could negatively affect those collaborations and potentially others;\n\uf0b7\nthe number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to future collaborators or acquirers;\n\uf0b7\ncollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidate in the most efficient manner or at all. If our present or future collaborator were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished or terminated; and\n\uf0b7\ncollaborators may be unable to obtain the necessary marketing approvals.\nIf future collaboration partners fail to develop or effectively commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidate for any of these reasons, such product candidate may not be approved for sale and our sales of such product candidate, if approved, may be limited, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to establish new collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe may selectively seek additional third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our likely collaborators for any collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators' abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nWe may be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidate or bring it to market and generate product revenue.\nOur employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity, such as employee training, may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending such action or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only\nlimited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we have the right to do so under our license agreements, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to police and protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages that we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications for any of our product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or which will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Although our license agreement with Dong-A ST includes a number of issued patents that are exclusively licensed to us, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and may, in some cases, not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nLaws and rulings by U.S. courts make it difficult to predict how patents will be issued or enforced in the biotechnology industry.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. There have been numerous changes to the patent laws and to the rules of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a transition from a \"first-to-invent\" system to a \"first- to-file\" system, and changes the way issued patents are challenged. Certain changes, such as the institution of inter partes review proceedings, came into effect on September 16, 2012. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain patents, and, if obtained, to enforce or defend them in litigation or post-grant proceedings, all of which could harm our business.\nFurthermore, the patent positions of companies engaged in the development and commercialization of biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Two cases involving diagnostic method claims and \"gene patents\" have been decided by the Supreme Court. On March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to measuring a metabolic product in a patient to optimize a drug dosage amount for the patient. According to the Supreme Court, the addition of well-understood, routine or conventional activity such as \"administering\" or \"determining\" steps was not enough to transform an otherwise patent ineligible natural phenomenon into patent eligible subject matter. On July 3, 2012, the USPTO issued guidance indicating that process claims directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon or an abstract\nidea that do not include additional elements or steps that integrate the natural principle into the claimed invention such that the natural principle is practically applied and the claim amounts to significantly more than the natural principle itself should be rejected as directed to non-statutory subject matter. On June 13, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., or Myriad, a case involving patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Myriad held that isolated segments of naturally occurring DNA, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patent eligible subject matter, but that complementary DNA, which is an artificial construct that may be created from RNA transcripts of genes, may be patent eligible.\nWe cannot assure you that our current patent protection and our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and products will not be negatively impacted by the decisions described above, rulings in other cases or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nMoreover, although the Supreme Court has held in Myriad that isolated segments of naturally occurring DNA are not patent-eligible subject matter, certain third parties could allege that activities that we may undertake infringe other gene-related patent claims, and we may deem it necessary to defend against these claims by asserting non-infringement and/or invalidity positions, or pay to obtain a license to these claims. In any of the foregoing or in other situations involving third-party intellectual property rights, if we are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement, we could be forced to pay damages or be subjected to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter. Such outcomes could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to protect or practice our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nIn jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection, competitors may use our intellectual property to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where it is more difficult to enforce a patent as compared to the U.S. competitor products may compete with our product candidates, if approved, or any future product candidate in jurisdictions where we do not have issued or granted patents or where we issued or granted patent claims or other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitor activities in these jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, make it difficult to enforce patents and such countries may not recognize other types of intellectual property protection, particularly that relating to pharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us to prevent the infringement of its patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in certain jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert its efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. If we, or our licensors, encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we, or any of our licensors, are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents and other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that our patent is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted\nnarrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded.\nLitigation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with its collaborators, misappropriation of its proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nIn addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nIn addition to the possibility of litigation relating to infringement claims asserted against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including inter partes review proceedings, post-grant review proceedings, derivation proceedings declared by the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign countries, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or future technologies or product candidates or products. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our intellectual property, including patents that may issue to or be licensed by us. As a result, we may be required to file claims in an effort to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. Any such claims could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us, including claims alleging that we infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. This can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming, and even if we are successful, any award of monetary damages or other remedy we may receive may not be commercially valuable. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that our asserted intellectual property is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our intellectual property does not cover its technology. An adverse determination in any litigation or defense proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nIf the breadth or strength of our patent or other intellectual property rights is compromised or threatened, it could allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products or result in our inability to commercialize our technology and products without infringing third-party intellectual property rights. Further, third parties may be dissuaded from collaborating with us.\nInterference or derivation proceedings brought by the USPTO or its foreign counterparts may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications, and we may also become involved in other proceedings, such as re-examination proceedings, before the USPTO or its foreign counterparts. Due to the substantial competition in the pharmaceutical space, the number of such proceedings may increase. This could delay the prosecution of our pending patent applications or impact the validity and enforceability of any future patents that we may obtain. In addition, any such litigation, submission or proceeding may be resolved adversely to us and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Moreover, intellectual property law relating to the fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent and other intellectual property positions in our industry are subject to change and are often uncertain. We may not prevail in any of these suits or other efforts to protect its technology, and the damages or other\nremedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. During the course of this type of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for the combined organization's common stock could be significantly harmed.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference and various post grant proceedings before the USPTO or non-U.S. opposition proceedings. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nAs a result of any such infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be compelled to seek intellectual property licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us likely would be nonexclusive, which would mean that our competitors also could obtain licenses to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product candidate or technology or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses of the relevant intellectual property on acceptable terms. Further, if we attempt to modify a product candidate or technology or to develop alternative methods or products in response to infringement claims or to avoid potential claims, we could incur substantial costs, encounter delays in product introductions or interruptions in sales. Ultimately, such efforts could be unsuccessful.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable and generally expensive and time consuming and is likely to divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional funds. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\nWe may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating or from successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that our employees or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nOur employees and consultants have been previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we are not aware of any claims currently pending against us, we may be subject to claims that these employees, or we have, inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information or intellectual property of the former employers of our employees. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation\ncould result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying money claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize product candidates, which would adversely affect our commercial development efforts.\nOur trade secrets are difficult to protect and if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technologies and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to seek patent protection on technology relating to our product candidates or obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. As a result, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they bring against us, to determine ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult and we do not know whether the procedures that we have followed to prevent such disclosure are or will be adequate. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of the technology or information that we protect as trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO, and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\uf0b7\nothers may be able to make product candidates that are similar to our candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\uf0b7\nwe or our future licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\uf0b7\nwe or our future licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\uf0b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\uf0b7\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\uf0b7\nissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\uf0b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\uf0b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\uf0b7\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 disease, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public health epidemic poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain and the manufacture or shipment of both drug substance and finished drug product for our product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical trials and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We often attend and present updates at various medical and investor conferences throughout the year. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, cancellations or reduced attendance of these conferences and we may need to seek alternate methods to present clinical updates and to engage with the medical and investment communities. The spread of COVID-19 may also slow potential enrollment of clinical trials and reduce the number of eligible patients for our clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures may also have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition and our potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nWe currently have a limited number of employees and our future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. We are highly dependent upon current members of our management team. Our employment relationships with our senior executives are at-will and do not prevent management from terminating their employment with us at any time by providing the requisite advance notice. We intend to increase our technical and management staff as needs arise and supporting resources become available, but the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 12 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational,\ndevelopment, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place will not be adequate to support our future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on our employees, including:\n\uf0b7\nmanaging our clinical trials effectively;\n\uf0b7\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\uf0b7\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, contractors and other third parties;\n\uf0b7\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\uf0b7\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative, research and development, and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing the company.\nWe intend to market our product candidates outside of the United States, and if we do, we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nBecause we intend to market our product candidates, if approved, outside of the United States, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Accordingly, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:\n\uf0b7\nfailure to develop an international sales, marketing and distribution system for our products;\n\uf0b7\nchanges in a specific country's or region's political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n\uf0b7\nunexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\uf0b7\ndifficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\uf0b7\ninadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\uf0b7\ninadequate data protection against unfair commercial use;\n\uf0b7\ntrade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\uf0b7\nthe effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\uf0b7\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or unplanned events.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nFurthermore, any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, tornadoes, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize the facilities, may have an adverse effect on our ability to operate the business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss\nof access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidates or interruption of our business operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology or loss of data, including any cyber security incidents, could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability which could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, our contract research organizations and other third parties on which we rely collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information, including research and development information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, breaches, unauthorized access, interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, or damage from natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any such event could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct research, development and commercialization activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy, any of which could adversely affect our business. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to rapid and significant technological change, which could render our technologies and products obsolete or uncompetitive.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to rapid and significant technological change, which could render certain of our products obsolete or uncompetitive. This is particularly true in the development of therapeutics for indications where new products and combinations of products are rapidly being developed that change the treatment paradigm for patients. There is no assurance that our product candidates will be the most effective, have the best safety profile, be the first to market, or be the most economical to make or use. The introduction of competitive therapies as alternatives to our product candidates could dramatically reduce the value of those development projects or chances of successfully commercializing those product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our long-term financial success.\nWe will compete with companies in the United States and internationally, including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies, specialized CROs, research and development firms, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources and selling and marketing capabilities, greater experience in clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have lower development and manufacturing costs.\nRisks Related to Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section, these factors include:\n\uf0b7\nadverse results or delays in preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory decisions or the development status of our product candidates or any product candidates we may pursue in the future;\n\uf0b7\nour ability to raise sufficient additional funds necessary for the continued development of our product candidates whether through potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements or otherwise;\n\uf0b7\nour ability to realize any value from Gemcabene, particularly in light of the partial clinical hold and the terminated NAFLD trial;\n\uf0b7\nthe terms and timing of any future collaborative, licensing or other strategic arrangements that we may establish;\n\uf0b7\nuncertainties created by our future management turnover;\n\uf0b7\nour inability to comply with the minimum listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC;\n\uf0b7\nthe timing of achievement of, or failure to achieve, our, or any potential collaborator\u2019s clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as the commencement of clinical development, the completion of a clinical trial or the receipt of regulatory approval;\n\uf0b7\ndecisions to initiate a clinical trial, not initiate a clinical trial, or terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\uf0b7\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates or regulatory actions requiring or leading to a delay or stoppage of any clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\nthe commercial success of any product approved by the FDA or its foreign counterparts;\n\uf0b7\nchanges in applicable laws, rules or regulations;\n\uf0b7\ndisputes with Pfizer regarding our licensed rights to Gemcabene;\n\uf0b7\nan inability to commercialize Gemcabene before April 16, 2024 as stipulated in the Pfizer license;\n\uf0b7\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers, suppliers, collaborators and other third parties;\n\uf0b7\noccurrence of health epidemics or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, and potential effects on our business, clinical trial sites, supply chain and manufacturing facilities;\n\uf0b7\nour failure to commercialize our product candidates;\n\uf0b7\nthe success of competitive drugs;\n\uf0b7\nif our patents covering our product candidates expire or are invalidated or are found to be unenforceable, or if some or all of our patent applications do not result in issued patents or result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims;\n\uf0b7\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\uf0b7\nunanticipated safety concerns related to the use of any product candidates;\n\uf0b7\nour announcements or our competitor's announcements regarding new products, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships and investments;\n\uf0b7\nthe size and growth of our target markets;\n\uf0b7\nour, or companies perceived to be similar to us, failure to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\uf0b7\nfluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\uf0b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industry, recommendations, earning results or estimates or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\uf0b7\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\uf0b7\nchanges in general economic, political and market conditions in any of the regions in which we conduct our business;\n\uf0b7\nchanges in our capital structure or dividend policy, future issuances of securities, sales of common stock by officers, directors and significant stockholders or our incurrence of additional debt;\n\uf0b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\uf0b7\nchanges in accounting practices and ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\uf0b7\ndisputes, litigation or developments relating to proprietary rights;\n\uf0b7\ntiming of milestones and royalty payments; and\n\uf0b7\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, Nasdaq, and the stock of biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to comply with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted, which could affect our common stock's market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq imposes, among other requirements, continued listing standards including minimum bid, public float and stockholders' equity requirements. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. A delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and likely the price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may enter into financing transactions that are dilutive to our stockholders, impose material restrictions on our business and/or require us to relinquish valuable rights.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of current stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.\nOur share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market after the expiration of certain lock-up restrictions imposed on our shareholders in connection with the Merger, or the perception that such sales could occur. As a condition to the closing of the Merger, certain stockholders of each of Gemphire and NeuroBo and their affiliates entered into lock-up agreements that restrict their ability to transfer shares of our capital stock for 180 days from the effective time of the Merger. Such lock-up restrictions expire on or about June 28, 2020.\nUpon the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, all of such shares will be eligible for resale in a public market, subject, in the case of shares held by our affiliates, to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Approximately 87% of our outstanding shares of common stock are currently held by holders we consider to be affiliates.\nAs restrictions on resale end, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and the bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace or remove their current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board. Among other things, these provisions:\n\uf0b7\nestablish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\uf0b7\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\uf0b7\nlimit the manner in which our stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\uf0b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\uf0b7\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\uf0b7\nprohibit our stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\uf0b7\nAuthorize our board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock, and which could be used to institute a shareholder rights plan, or so-called \"poison pill,\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board; and\n\uf0b7\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with it for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be maintained.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market for our shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market or any other exchange in the future. If there is no active market for our common stock, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nIf one or more analysts cover our business and downgrade their evaluations of our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur executive officers, directors, and their affiliates exercise significant control over us, which will limit the ability of our stockholders to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our officers, directors, and their respective affiliates had beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, of approximately 60.3% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if they act together, may be able to influence our management and affairs and control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction. Some of these stockholders acquired some or all of their shares of common stock for substantially less than the current trading price of our common stock, and these stockholders may have interests, with respect to our common stock, that are different from other stockholders. In addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our common stock, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us, or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and a \"smaller reporting company\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to such companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,\" including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nEven after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \"smaller reporting company,\" which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the stock exchange upon which our common stock is listed and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government\nintervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules of the SEC that generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act or a \"smaller reporting company\", we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies and/or smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to, for emerging growth companies, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Once we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" and if our public float is above $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if before such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nTo achieve compliance with Section 404, we are required to engage in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we must dedicate internal resources, hire additional finance and accounting personnel, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.\nDuring the course of our review and testing, we may identify deficiencies and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall.\nIn addition, as a public company we are required to timely file accurate quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. In order to report our results of operations and financial statements on an accurate and timely basis, we will depend on CROs to provide timely and accurate notice of their costs to it. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from Nasdaq or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements or impair our ability to produce accurate and timely consolidated financial statements.\nWe concluded that there was a material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting relating to accounting for clinical trial expenses. For more information about this material weakness, see Part II, Item 9A (Controls and Procedures) of this report. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAlthough we have begun to take measures to remediate this material weakness, the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weakness will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe do not anticipate declaring or paying, in the foreseeable future, any cash dividends on our capital stock and, consequently, the ability of our stockholders to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock and do not currently intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased them.\nOur Bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will generally be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on its behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision does not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act or any claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of the bylaws described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nThe global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in the past several years, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. We cannot assure you that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require it to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.", "PERMNO": 16255, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GEMP"}
