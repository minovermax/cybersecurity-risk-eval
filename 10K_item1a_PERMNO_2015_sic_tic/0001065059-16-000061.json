{"cik": "1065059", "company": "CENTRUS ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect Centrus\u2019 financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Company. Below, we describe certain important operational, financial, strategic and legal and compliance risks.\nOperational Risks\nOperational risks relate to risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the operation of our business, including supply chain and business disruption and data protection and security, including cyber security.\nWe are dependent on existing inventory, purchases of Russian LEU and purchases from other suppliers to meet our obligations to customers.\nWe ceased enrichment at the Paducah GDP at the end of May 2013. The economics, timing and ability of Centrus to commercialize an advanced uranium enrichment centrifuge technology as a replacement for the Paducah GDP are uncertain. As a result, we are dependent on existing inventory, purchases of Russian LEU, and purchases from other suppliers to meet our obligations to customers. We are acquiring alternative sources of supply in the market, given the current oversupply. The availability, cost and terms of additional alternative sources of supply are subject to variables that are difficult to predict. A significant delay in, or stoppage or termination of, deliveries of LEU under those supply agreements could adversely affect our ability to make deliveries to customers and would adversely affect revenues and results of operations. A delay, stoppage or termination could occur due to a number of factors, including logistical problems with shipments, commercial or political disputes between the parties or their governments, imposition of sanctions in response to geopolitical events or a failure or inability by either party to meet the terms of such agreements. An interruption of deliveries could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be unable to sell all of the LEU purchased under supply agreements including the commercial Russian LEU that is purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement, for prices that cover our purchase costs, which could adversely affect profitability and the viability of our business.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from supply agreements we enter into, including the Russian Supply Agreement, because of current market prices for LEU and restrictions on U.S. imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation. The pricing mechanisms of our supply agreements may not align with pricing provided in our new or existing sales contracts and could result in sales prices that do not cover our purchase costs. The price we are charged for the SWU component of Russian LEU under the Russian Supply Agreement is determined by a formula that combines a mix of market-related price points and other factors. A multi-year retrospective view of market-based price points in the formula is used to minimize the disruptive effect of short-term swings in these price points, but may result in prices that are not aligned with the prevailing market prices when those prices are depressed, or declining as is currently the case. Currently, the price we pay for Russian LEU is above current market prices. Further, there are floor prices applicable to the calculation of the price for such SWU. The agreement provides for reexamination of a key element of the pricing formula in later years to account for significant increases or decreases in market prices. We expect this will result in a reduction in the price we would pay in those years, but there can be no assurance that an unexpected change will not occur that could lead to a different result. Other existing or new supply agreements may have pricing mechanisms that may not be aligned with market prices. These factors may limit our ability to make new sales at prices that exceed the purchase price we pay for the LEU.\nRestrictions on imports or sales of Russian LEU could adversely affect our ability to sell commercial Russian LEU purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement which could adversely affect profitability and the viability of our business.\nWhile the prices included in existing sales contracts in our order book currently exceed the price we pay for Russian LEU, our ability to place Russian LEU into existing contracts is subject to U.S. import limitations and, in some cases, the contracts\u2019 terms.\nSales of Russian LEU are more challenging than sales of non-Russian material. Some of our customers are unable or unwilling to accept Russian LEU. In addition, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Russian Supply Agreement because of restrictions on U.S. imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation. These imports are subject to quotas imposed under legislation enacted into law in September 2008 and under the 1992 Russian Suspension Agreement, as amended. The quota is subject to periodic review by the DOC. The next review occurs in 2016 and the quota for the amount of Russian LEU could be increased or reduced as a result of the review. Under the Russian Supply Agreement, we are only permitted to use a portion of the quotas to make sales in the United States. Uncertainty about the quota in future years or a reduction in the quota could impact our ability to make future sales of Russian LEU. We also are dependent upon TENEX to grant us the right to use the available quotas.\nThe Russian LEU that we cannot sell for consumption in the United States will have to be sold for consumption by utilities outside the United States. The ability to sell to those utilities may be limited by policies of foreign governments or regional institutions that seek to restrict the amount of Russian LEU purchased by utilities under their jurisdiction, as well as requirements that Russian LEU imported into the United States to be used to fabricate fuel for foreign customers must be processed and re-exported within a certain period of time. In addition, foreign utilities who take delivery of LEU from us in the United States may be unwilling to cooperate with us in meeting the requirements under U.S. law to permit us to import Russian LEU to deliver to them. Further, geopolitical events, including domestic or international reactions or responses to such events and subsequent government or international actions including the imposition of sanctions, could also impact our ability to purchase, sell or make deliveries of LEU from Russia to customers. An interruption of deliveries under the Russian Supply Agreement could, depending on the length of such an interruption, threaten our ability to fulfill these delivery commitments with adverse effects on our reputation, costs, results of operations, cash flows and long-term viability. Even in the absence of sanctions or other legal restrictions, customers may be unwilling to agree to purchase or amend contracts to permit delivery of the Russian LEU. Accordingly, while we expect to secure supplies of non-Russian LEU in the currently oversupplied market in order to meet our contract obligations, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to sell Russian LEU in or outside of the United States.\nWe face risks associated with reliance on third-party suppliers to meet customer commitments.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide essential services to the Company, such as the storage and management of inventory, transportation and radiation protection. We face the risk that those service providers may not perform on time, with the desired quality or at all for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control. Alternative third-party suppliers may not be readily available or may be more costly. As a result of such risks, we may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our relationship with customers could be negatively affected, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. Customers place great value in the reliability of their supply of fuel for their reactors. Failure to make a delivery could have an adverse effect on our ability to make new sales and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nPeriodically, events or issues arise that may affect the performance of our suppliers. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to address these events or issues will be successful in minimizing potential impacts to the Company and our customers. Unless adequately addressed, such events or issues could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nDependence on our largest customers could adversely affect us.\nIn 2015, our 10 largest customers represented 97% of total revenue and our three largest customers represented 53% of total revenue. A reduction in purchases from our largest customers, whether due to their decision not to purchase optional quantities or for other reasons, including a disruption in their operations that reduces their need for LEU from us, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are seeing increased price competition as competitors and secondary suppliers lower their prices to sell excess supply created by current market conditions. This has adversely affected our sales efforts. Because price is a significant factor in a customer\u2019s choice of a LEU supplier, when contracts come up for renewal, customers may reduce their purchases from us if we are not able to compete on price, resulting in the loss of new sales contracts. Once lost, customers may be difficult to regain because they typically purchase LEU under long-term contracts. Therefore, given the need to maintain existing customer relationships, particularly with the largest customers, our ability to raise prices to respond to increases in costs or other developments may be limited. In addition, because we have a commitment to acquire Russian LEU under the Russian Supply Agreement, any reduction in purchases by the customers below the level required for us to resell both our inventory and the Russian material could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe dollar amount of the sales order book, as stated at any given time, is not necessarily indicative of future sales revenues and is subject to uncertainty.\nOur order book of sales is the estimated aggregate dollar amount of SWU and uranium sales that we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods under existing contracts with customers. There is no assurance that the revenues projected will be realized, or, if realized, will result in profits. Most of our contracts provide for fixed purchases of SWU during a given year. Our estimate of the order book is partially based on customers\u2019 estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and other assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. The order book is also based on estimates of selling prices, which are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU or uranium market price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are unpredictable, particularly in light of general uncertainty in the nuclear market and the economy generally. We use external composite forecasts of future market prices and inflation rates in our pricing estimates. These forecasts may not be accurate, and therefore estimates of future prices could be overstated. Any inaccuracy in estimates of future prices would add to the imprecision of the order book estimate.\nFor a variety of reasons, the amounts of SWU and uranium that we will sell in the future under existing contracts, and the timing of customer purchases under those contracts, may differ from estimates. Customers may not purchase as much as we predicted, nor at the times we anticipated, as a result of operational difficulties, changes in fuel requirements or other reasons. Reduced purchases would reduce the revenues we actually receive from contracts included in the order book. Customers could also seek to modify or cancel orders in response to concerns regarding our financial strength or future business prospects. Further, financial and operational issues facing our customers could affect the order book.\nThe order book includes sales prices that are significantly above current market prices. Customers may seek to limit their obligations under these existing contracts or may be unwilling to continue contracts that have termination rights. Some long-term contracts in our order book were established with milestones related to the ACP that permit termination with respect to portions of the contract under limited circumstances that vary across the contracts. While we have waived, eliminated or renegotiated those termination rights where possible, we estimate that approximately 35% of our order book remains at various levels of risk due to milestones related to ACP deployment. Some of these customers have indicated they expect to exercise such contract termination rights. We are also working with customers to modify contracts that have delivery, scheduling, origin or other terms that may require modifications to address our anticipated supply sources during the transition period. We have no assurance that our customers will agree to revise existing contracts or will not seek to exercise contract termination rights or require concessions, which could adversely affect the value of our order book and our prospects.\nFailures or security breaches of information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires us to use and protect classified, sensitive and other protected information as well as business proprietary information and intellectual property. Our computer networks and other IT systems are designed to protect this information through the use of classified networks and other procedures. A material network breach in the security of the IT systems could include the theft of our business proprietary and intellectual property. To the extent any security breach results in a loss or damage to data, or in inappropriate disclosure of classified or other protected information, it could cause grave damage to the country\u2019s national security and to our business. One of the biggest threats to classified information we protect comes from the insider threat - an employee with legitimate access who engages in misconduct. Transitions in the business, in particular the potential for employee layoffs and other transitions, can increase the risk that an insider with access could steal our intellectual property.\nFinancial Risks\nFinancial risks relate to our financial condition, capital structure and ability to meet financial obligations and the price, volatility and ownership concentration of our Class A Common Stock.\nAdoption of fresh start accounting beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 may have a significant effect on our financial condition and future results of operations.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 852. Our consolidated financial statements also reflect all of the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are not comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company\u2019s historical financial statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our Class A Common Stock.\nAs part of the adoption of fresh start accounting upon our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, fair value adjustments for the Company were made that will adversely impact our results of operations in future periods. These adjustments:\n\u2022\nsignificantly reduce the future gross profit impact of revenues that were deferred at emergence;\n\u2022\nresult in the amortization of sales order book and customer relationship intangible assets that were created at emergence; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher cost of sales as a result of increasing inventory values at emergence.\nIn addition, we evaluate the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets by performing impairment tests whenever adverse conditions or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment loss. If impairment is indicated, the asset carrying value will be reduced to fair market value, adversely impacting our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the carrying value of the unidentifiable intangible asset, or excess reorganization value, is evaluated by performing an impairment test on at least an annual basis. The excess reorganization value was tested for impairment and was determined to be fully impaired as of December 31, 2015. An impairment charge of $137.2 million was recognized in 2015 for the carrying value of the excess reorganization value.\nThe Company has significant long-term liabilities.\nWhile the restructuring under the Plan of Reorganization significantly reduced the amount of and extended the maturity of our debt, we emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy with significant long-term liabilities. In addition to the indebtedness under the PIK Toggle Notes, we still have substantial pension and postretirement health and life benefit obligations and other long-term liabilities. In addition, the terms of the indenture governing our PIK Toggle Notes will not restrict Centrus or any of its subsidiaries from incurring substantial additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur significant long-term liabilities (and other third-party financial obligations) could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to lenders and other creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness or breaches of such other commitments;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and have less flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in the nuclear enrichment industry which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to industry competitors that have less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nwe may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing for future working capital, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nwe will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to payments on the PIK Toggle Notes thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.\nIf we incur substantial additional indebtedness, the foregoing risks would intensify. Additional information concerning the PIK Toggle Notes including the terms and conditions of the PIK Toggle Notes are described in Note 10, Debt, of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has material unfunded defined benefit pension plans obligations and postretirement health and life benefit obligations. These liabilities are anticipated to require material contributions in future periods, which may divert funds from other uses and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s liquidity and prospects.\nCentrus and its subsidiary, United States Enrichment Corporation (\u201cEnrichment Corp.\u201d), maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans that are guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d), a wholly owned U.S. government corporation that was created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Centrus also maintains non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for certain executive officers. In addition, Enrichment Corp. maintains postretirement health and life benefit plans. These plans are anticipated to require material cash contributions in the future, which may divert funds from other uses and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s liquidity depending on the timing of any required contributions or payments in relation to the Company\u2019s sources of cash and other payment obligations. See also the Risk Factor, Levels of returns on pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and postretirement benefit liabilities could adversely affect earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nIn addition, we have been engaged in discussions with the PBGC regarding the status of the qualified pension plans, including with respect to potential liability under ERISA Section 4062(e) related to the Company ceasing enrichment operations and returning the Portsmouth and Paducah GDP facilities to DOE. In the event the PBGC were to determine there are funding obligations under section 4062(e), the Company believes that any such liability would be fully satisfied under the provisions of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (the \u201cCFCAA\u201d), which made major changes to ERISA section 4062(e). The PBGC, however, has other authorities under ERISA that it may consider to address the Portsmouth and Paducah transitions or otherwise in connection with the Company\u2019s qualified defined benefit pension plans. These authorities include, but are not limited to, initiating involuntary termination of underfunded plans and seeking liens or additional funding.\nIn 2014, prior to enactment of the CFCAA, the PBGC informed the Company that the PBGC had retained an outside financial advisor to advise the PBGC on the Company\u2019s business and the need for and advisability of any actions that may be taken by the PBGC. The Company has continued discussions with PBGC and its financial advisor and has engaged a financial advisor on this matter. The PBGC has indicated it would like to discuss the potential for the Company to make contributions to the pension in advance of statutory funding requirements as amended by the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. In the event that the PBGC initiates involuntary termination actions or seeks liens or additional funding related to such plans, in light of current demands on our liquidity and depending on the timing and amount of any obligations that may arise from such PBGC actions, we might not have the cash needed to address such actions, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and prospects.\nIn addition, the PBGC could take the position that our decision to further demobilize the American Centrifuge project, either alone or taken together with the transition of the Portsmouth GDP and Paducah GDP, could create additional potential liabilities under ERISA Section 4062(e) or other provisions under ERISA with respect to either the Enrichment Corp. or the Centrus pension plans.\nLevels of returns on pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and postretirement benefit liabilities could adversely affect earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nEarnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with expense for the pension and postretirement benefit plans. GAAP require a company to calculate expense for these plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension and postretirement benefit expenses for the following year are the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The rate of return on pension assets and changes in interest rates affect funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans. The IRS and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 regulate the minimum amount we contribute to our pension plans. The amount required to contribute to pension plans can have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nRevenue is recognized at the time LEU or uranium is delivered under the terms of customer contracts. Customer demand is affected by, among other things, electricity markets, reactor operations, maintenance and the timing of refueling outages. Utilities typically schedule the shutdown of their reactors for refueling to coincide with the low electricity demand periods of spring and fall. Thus, some reactors are scheduled for annual or two-year refuelings in the spring or fall, or for 18-month cycles alternating between both seasons. Customer payments for the SWU component of LEU typically average approximately $15 to $20 million per order. As a result, a relatively small change in the timing of customer orders for LEU due to a change in a customer\u2019s refueling schedule may cause operating results to be substantially above or below expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nCentrus is dependent on intercompany support from Enrichment Corp.\nSubstantially all revenue-generating operations of the Company are conducted at the subsidiary level. The financing obtained from Enrichment Corp. funds Centrus\u2019 general corporate expenses, including cash interest payments on the PIK Toggle Notes. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrus, Enrichment Corp. has its own set of creditors and a separate board of directors, including independent directors (the \u201cEnrichment Board\u201d), who are elected by Centrus. The Enrichment Board has authorized Enrichment Corp. to provide such funding and to provide a guarantee with respect to the PIK Toggle Notes issued under the Plan of Reorganization. Such current and future funding and support are conditional and dependent on Enrichment Corp.\u2019s own financial condition and a determination by the Enrichment Board that such funding is in the interest of Enrichment Corp.\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nIn the period since the issuance of our Class A Common Stock, the price of our Class A Common Stock has been declining and remains subject to volatility, and the current market price of our Class A Common Stock may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the future. The market price and level of trading of our Class A Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our Class A Common Stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results. The automatic conversion (with limited exceptions) of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock upon the sale of Class B Common Stock could significantly adversely impact the trading price of the Class A Common Stock on the NYSE MKT.\nOur PIK Toggle Notes are not listed on any securities exchange. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the PIK Toggle Notes. The PIK Toggle Notes may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations for the PIK Toggle Notes may not be available. In addition, the trading prices of the PIK Toggle Notes will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the limited trading volume of the PIK Toggle Notes and the other factors discussed above with respect to the Class A Common Stock.\nA small number of Class A stockholders may exert significant influence over the direction of the Company.\nAs of February 1, 2016, based solely on amounts reported in Schedule 13G filings with the SEC, two principal stockholders (those stockholders with beneficial ownership of more than 10% of our Class A Common Stock) collectively beneficially own approximately 28.7% of our Class A Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger of the Company or sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. These stockholders may have interests that differ from and may vote in a way adverse to other holders of Class A Common Stock. This concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other stockholders to effect substantial changes in the Company and may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of the Company.\nStrategic Risks\nStrategic risks relate to the Company\u2019s future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with: the global macro-environment in which we operate; the demand for our products and services, competitive threats and technology innovation.\nOur future prospects are tied directly to the nuclear energy industry worldwide.\nPotential events that could affect either nuclear reactors under current or future contracts with us or the nuclear industry as a whole, include:\n\u2022\naccidents, terrorism or other incidents at nuclear facilities or involving shipments of nuclear materials;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions or changes in regulations by nuclear regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\ndecisions by agencies, courts or other bodies that limit our ability to seek relief under applicable trade laws to offset unfair competition or pricing by foreign competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in other areas of the nuclear fuel cycle, such as uranium supplies or conversion;\n\u2022\ncivic opposition to, or changes in government policies regarding, nuclear operations;\n\u2022\nbusiness decisions concerning reactors or reactor operations;\n\u2022\nthe need for generating capacity; or\n\u2022\nconsolidation within the electric power industry.\nThese events could adversely affect us to the extent they result in a reduction or elimination of customers\u2019 contractual requirements to purchase from us, the suspension or reduction of nuclear reactor operations, the reduction of supplies of raw materials, lower demand, burdensome regulation, disruptions of shipments or production, increased competition from third parties, increased operational costs or difficulties or increased liability for actual or threatened property damage or personal injury.\nThe continued excess supply of LEU in the market could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nApproximately 60 reactors in Japan and Germany were taken off-line following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused irreparable damage to four reactors in Fukushima, Japan. Two reactors in Japan restarted commercial operation in 2015, and Japanese utilities have requested permission to restart a total of 21 reactors. Germany has shut down eight of its reactors and announced that it will be phasing out all 17 nuclear reactors by 2022. Although we do not serve any of the German reactors, the shutdown of any reactor contributes to the excess supply in the market.\nThe events at Fukushima and its aftermath have negatively affected the balance of supply and demand. This impact could continue to grow depending on the length and severity of delays or cancellations of deliveries. The longer that this demand is reduced or absent from the market, the greater the cumulative impact on the market. Market prices for our products are at their lowest levels in more than a decade and this trend could continue or worsen. Suppliers whose deliveries are cancelled or delayed due to shutdown reactors or delays in reactor refuelings have excess supply available to sell in the market. This has adversely affected our success in selling LEU. The events have created significant uncertainty and our business, results of operations, and prospects have been and in the future could be adversely affected.\nWe have long been a leading supplier of LEU to Japan and TEPCO, owner of the Fukushima plant, has historically been one of our largest customers. Sales to Japanese utility customers in 2015 were $77.8 million. A portion of these contracts are requirements contracts and therefore sales to Japanese utility customers with such contracts could be delayed or ultimately canceled depending on how quickly their reactors return to service. If deliveries under contracts included in our order book are significantly delayed, modified or canceled, because purchases are tied to requirements or because customers seek to limit their obligations under existing contracts, our revenues and earnings may be adversely impacted, with a corresponding impact on our financial condition and prospects.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business.\nThe success of our business depends on key executives, managers, scientists, engineers and other skilled personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. Changes in senior management could create uncertainty among our employees, customers and other third parties with which we do business. Our future success depends in large part upon the effective transition of our new management team. The inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives could negatively affect our operations, strategic planning and performance.\nThe Company could further demobilize or terminate the American Centrifuge project in the future, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity and could trigger termination of the limited, conditional guaranty by Enrichment Corp. of the PIK Toggle Notes.\nCentrus has begun the process of demobilizing its American Centrifuge demonstration cascade at its test facility in Piketon, Ohio, following a determination by DOE that the cascade has already successfully delivered the necessary operational data and that funding additional demonstration at the Piketon facility is therefore unnecessary. The cascade in Ohio will be decommissioned and decontaminated (D&D). We expect the D&D effort will continue through the end of 2016. Cash expenditures for D&D, employee severance and other demobilization costs are anticipated to occur primarily in 2016 and are projected in a range of $50 million to $60 million. Centrus has previously provided financial assurance to the NRC and DOE for D&D and lease turnover costs in the form of surety bonds of approximately $16 million and $13 million, respectively, which are fully cash collateralized by Centrus. Centrus expects cash deposits will be returned as surety bonds are cancelled following its performance of D&D or reduced based on our satisfaction of lease conditions. Our actual costs could be greater than our estimates which could have an adverse impact on Centrus\u2019 results of operations and liquidity.\nAny further reductions in spending on the American Centrifuge project could have an adverse impact on Centrus\u2019 results of operations and liquidity, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncause Centrus to implement worker layoffs and potentially lose additional key skilled personnel, all of whom have security clearances, which could be difficult to re-hire or replace, and incur severance and other termination costs;\n\u2022\ncause Centrus to suspend or to terminate contracts with suppliers and contractors involved in the American Centrifuge project and make it more difficult to obtain key suppliers for the ACP and preserve the manufacturing infrastructure developed over the last several years;\n\u2022\ndelay the American Centrifuge project and increase its overall cost, which could adversely affect the overall economics of the project and Centrus\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize the American Centrifuge technology; and\n\u2022\ncause Centrus to terminate the remaining portions of the American Centrifuge project and result in the loss of technical capabilities and key resources that could be useful in deploying a future commercial enrichment plant using the American Centrifuge technology or other technologies.\nTermination of the American Centrifuge project or termination of DOE funding of the project could trigger termination of the limited, conditional guaranty by Enrichment Corp. of the PIK Toggle Notes (other than with respect to the unconditional interest claim) as provided in the indenture governing the PIK Toggle Notes.\nThe potential for DOE to seek to terminate or exercise its remedies under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and our other agreements with DOE, or to require modifications to such agreements that are adverse to Centrus\u2019 interests, may have adverse consequences on the Company.\nUSEC and DOE signed an agreement dated June 17, 2002, as amended (the \u201c2002 DOE-USEC Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the parties made long-term commitments directed at resolving issues related to the stability and security of the domestic uranium enrichment industry. DOE consented to the assumption by Centrus of the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and other agreements between the Company and DOE subject to an express reservation of all rights, remedies and defenses by DOE and Centrus under those agreements as part of Centrus' Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. The 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement requires Centrus to develop, demonstrate and deploy advanced enrichment technology in accordance with milestones and provides for remedies in the event of a failure to meet a milestone under certain circumstances.\nDOE has specific remedies under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement if Centrus fails to meet a milestone that would adversely impact its ability to begin commercial operations of the American Centrifuge Plant on schedule, and such delay was within Centrus\u2019 control or was due to its fault or negligence or if Centrus abandons or constructively abandons the commercial deployment of an advanced enrichment technology. These remedies include terminating the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement, revoking Centrus\u2019 access to DOE\u2019s centrifuge technology that is required for the success of the American Centrifuge project, requiring Centrus to transfer certain rights in the American Centrifuge technology and facilities to DOE, and requiring Centrus to reimburse DOE for certain costs associated with the American Centrifuge project.\nThe 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement provides that if a delaying event beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of Centrus occurs that could affect Centrus\u2019 ability to meet an American Centrifuge Plant milestone, DOE and Centrus will jointly meet to discuss in good faith possible adjustments to the milestones as appropriate to accommodate the delaying event. The Company notified DOE that it had not met the June 2014 milestone within the time period currently provided due to events beyond its control and without the fault or negligence of the Company. The assumption of the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement provided for under the Plan of Reorganization did not impact the ability of either party to assert all rights, remedies and defenses under the agreement and all such rights, remedies and defenses are specifically preserved and all time limits tolled expressly including all rights, remedies and defenses and time limits relating to any missed milestones. DOE and Centrus have agreed that all rights, remedies and defenses of the parties with respect to any missed milestones since March 5, 2014, including the June 2014 and November 2014 milestones, and all other matters under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement continued to be preserved, and that the time limits for each party to respond to any missed milestones continue to be tolled.\nDOE may seek to exercise remedies under such agreements and there is no assurance that the parties will be able to reach agreement on appropriate modifications to the agreements in the future. Moreover, even if the parties reach agreement on modifications to such agreements, there is no assurance that such modifications will not impose material additional requirements, provide DOE with material additional rights or remedies or otherwise affect the overall economics of the American Centrifuge Plant and the ability to finance and successfully deploy the project. Any of these actions could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nCentrus also granted to DOE an irrevocable, non-exclusive right to use or permit third parties on behalf of DOE to use all centrifuge technology intellectual property (\u201cCentrifuge IP\u201d) royalty free for U.S. government purposes (which includes national defense purposes, including providing nuclear material to operate commercial nuclear power reactors for tritium production). Centrus also granted an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to DOE to use such Centrifuge IP developed at its expense for commercial purposes (including a right to sublicense), which may be exercised only if Centrus misses any of the milestones under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement or if Centrus (or its affiliate or entity acting through it) is no longer willing or able to proceed with, or has determined to abandon or has constructively abandoned, the commercial deployment of the centrifuge technology. Such a commercial purposes license is subject to payment of an agreed upon royalty to Centrus, which shall not exceed $665 million in the aggregate. Any of these actions could have an adverse impact on Centrus\u2019 business and prospects.\nWe face significant competition from three major producers who may be less cost sensitive or may be favored due to national loyalties, as well as from emerging competitors.\nWe compete with three major producers of LEU, all of which are wholly or substantially owned by governments: Areva (France), Rosatom/TENEX (Russia) and Urenco (Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom). Our competitors have greater financial resources than we do. Foreign competitors enjoy support from their government owners, which may enable them to be less cost- or profit-sensitive than we are. In addition, decisions by foreign competitors may be influenced by political and economic policy considerations rather than commercial considerations. For example, foreign competitors may elect to increase their production or exports of LEU, even when not justified by market conditions, thereby depressing prices and reducing demand for LEU, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. Similarly, the elimination or weakening of existing restrictions on imports from foreign competitors could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, our competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of improved market conditions and increase capacity to meet any future market expansion.\nThe ability to compete in certain foreign markets may be limited for political, legal and economic reasons.\nAgreements for cooperation between the U.S. government and various foreign governments or governmental agencies control the export of nuclear materials from the United States. If any of the agreements governing exports to countries in which customers are located were to lapse, terminate or be amended, it is possible sales could no longer be made or LEU could no longer be delivered to customers in those countries. This could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nPurchases of LEU by customers in the European Union are subject to a policy of the Euratom Supply Agency that seeks to limit foreign enriched uranium to no more than 20% of European Union consumption per year. Application of this policy to consumption in the European Union of the LEU that we supply or purchase can significantly limit our ability to make sales to European customers.\nFurther, geopolitical events, including domestic or international reactions or responses to such events and subsequent government or international actions including the imposition of sanctions, could also impact our ability to purchase, sell or make deliveries of LEU to customers.\nCertain emerging markets lack a comprehensive nuclear liability law that protects suppliers by channeling liability for injury and property damage suffered by third persons from nuclear incidents at a nuclear facility to the facility\u2019s operator. To the extent a country does not have such a law and has not otherwise provided nuclear liability protection for suppliers to the projects to which we supply SWU, we intend to negotiate terms in customer contracts that we believe will adequately protect us in a manner consistent with this channeling principle. However, if a customer is unwilling to agree to such contract terms, the lack of clear protection for suppliers in the national laws of these countries could adversely affect our ability to compete for sales to meet the growing demand for LEU in these markets and our prospects for future revenue from such sales.\nChanges to, or termination of, any agreements with the U.S. government, or deterioration in our relationship with the U.S. government, could adversely affect results of operations.\nWe are a party to a number of agreements and arrangements with the U.S. government that are important to the business, including:\n\u2022\nleases for the centrifuge facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and other agreements that address issues relating to the domestic uranium enrichment industry and centrifuge technology.\nWe are also in the process of entering into a new our contract with UT-Battelle, as operator of ORNL for DOE, to provide engineering and testing work to preserve and advance the American Centrifuge uranium enrichment technology.\nTermination, expiration or failure to obtain one or more of these agreements, without replacement with an equivalent agreement or arrangement that accomplishes the same objectives as such agreement(s), could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, deterioration in our relationship with the U.S. agencies that are parties to these agreements could impair or impede our ability to successfully implement these agreements which could adversely affect results of operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nLegal and compliance risks relate to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment and action; legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including those relating to financial reporting and environmental health and safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or cause us to have to change our business models or practices.\nOur operations are highly regulated by the NRC and DOE.\nOur operations are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC has granted two licenses for the Piketon facility, a license for the test facility was granted in February 2004 and a separate license to construct and operate a commercial plant was granted in April 2007. Centrus intends to terminate the license for the test facility upon completion of the D&D activities. Centrus intends to continue to maintain its license for the commercial plant.\nThe NRC could refuse to renew our licenses if it determines that: (1) we are foreign owned, controlled or dominated; (2) the issuance of a renewed license would be inimical to the maintenance of a reliable and economic domestic source of enrichment; (3) the issuance of a renewed license would be adverse to U.S. defense or security objectives; or (4) the issuance of a renewed license is otherwise not consistent with applicable laws or regulations in effect at the time of renewal.\nThe NRC has the authority to issue notices of violation for violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the NRC regulations and conditions of licenses, certificates of compliance, or orders. The NRC has the authority to impose civil penalties or additional requirements and to order cessation of operations for violations of its regulations. Penalties under the NRC regulations could include substantial fines, imposition of additional requirements or withdrawal or suspension of licenses or certificates. Any penalties imposed on Centrus could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The NRC also has the authority to issue new regulatory requirements or to change existing requirements. Changes to the regulatory requirements could also adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the centrifuge technology development and manufacturing facilities in Oak Ridge, and certain operations at our other facilities, are subject to regulation by DOE. DOE has the authority to impose civil penalties and additional requirements, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations involve the use, transportation and disposal of toxic, hazardous and/or radioactive materials and could result in liability without regard to fault or negligence.\nOur operations involve the use of toxic, hazardous and radioactive materials. A release of these materials could pose a health risk to humans or animals. If an accident were to occur, its severity would depend on the volume of the release and the speed of corrective action taken by plant emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and wind conditions. Actions taken in response to an actual or suspected release of these materials, including a precautionary evacuation, could result in significant costs for which we could be legally responsible. In addition to health risks, a release of these materials may cause damage to, or the loss of, property and may adversely affect property values.\nDespite the ongoing D&D at our Piketon, Ohio test facility, we continue to lease facilities from DOE at the centrifuge test facilities in Piketon, Ohio and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, DOE has indemnified the Company against claims for public liability (as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended) arising out of or in connection with activities under those leases resulting from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation. If an incident or evacuation is not covered under the DOE indemnification, we could be financially liable for damages arising from such incident or evacuation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The DOE indemnification does not apply to incidents outside the United States, including in connection with international transportation of LEU.\nWhile DOE has provided indemnification pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, there could be delays in obtaining reimbursement for costs from DOE and DOE may determine that some or all costs are not reimbursable under the indemnification. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act indemnification does not cover loss or damage to property located on the leased facilities due to a nuclear incident.\nIn our contracts, we seek to protect ourselves from liability, but there is no assurance that such contractual limitations on liability will be effective in all cases. The costs of defending against a claim arising out of a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation, and any damages awarded as a result of such a claim, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments that are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this report for a discussion of assumptions, estimates and judgments related to our accounting for asset valuations, D&D obligations, pension and postretirement health and life benefit costs and obligations and income taxes. Changes in accounting rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE MKT could result in a delisting of our Class A Common Stock and would impair stockholders\u2019 ability to sell or purchase our Class A Common Stock.\nOn November 17, 2015, the Company received notice from the NYSE MKT indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and (ii) of the NYSE MKT's Company Guide since it reported a stockholders\u2019 deficit as of September 30, 2015, and net losses in its fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. On January 25, 2016, the NYSE MKT accepted the Company\u2019s compliance plan that demonstrates the Company\u2019s ability to regain compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and (ii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide by May 17, 2017. During this period, the Company\u2019s common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE MKT, subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with the other NYSE MKT listing standards and periodic reviews by the NYSE MKT. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by May 17, 2017, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the plan, the NYSE MKT may initiate delisting procedures as appropriate. A delisting of our Class A Common Stock by the NYSE MKT and the failure of our Class A Common Stock to be listed on another national exchange could have significant adverse consequences. A delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock and would impair stockholders\u2019 ability to sell or purchase our Class A Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives us certain rights with respect to equity securities held (beneficially or of record) by foreign persons. If levels of foreign ownership set forth in our certificate of incorporation are exceeded, we have the right, among other things, to redeem or exchange Common Stock held by foreign persons, and in certain cases, the applicable redemption price or exchange value may be equal to the lower of fair market value or a foreign person\u2019s purchase price.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives us certain rights with respect to shares of our common stock held (beneficially or of record) by foreign persons. Foreign persons are defined in our certificate of incorporation to include, among others, an individual who is not a U.S. citizen, an entity that is organized under the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and an entity that is controlled by individuals who are not U.S. citizens or by entities that are organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the following events is a \u201cforeign ownership review event\u201d and triggers the board of directors\u2019 right to take various actions under our certificate of incorporation: (1) the beneficial ownership by a foreign person of (a) 5% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of our equity securities, (b) 5% or more in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of our equity securities, or (c) less than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of our equity securities or less than 5% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of our equity securities, if such foreign person is entitled to control the appointment and tenure of any of our management positions or any director; (2) the beneficial ownership of any shares of any class of our equity securities by or for the account of a foreign uranium enrichment provider or a foreign competitor (defined in our certificate of incorporation as a \u201cContravening Person\u201d); or (3) any ownership of, or exercise of rights with respect to, shares of any class of our equity securities or other exercise or attempt to exercise control of us that is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any regulatory restrictions, or that could jeopardize the continued operations of our facilities (defined in our certificate of incorporation as an \u201cAdverse Regulatory Occurrence\u201d). These rights include requesting information from holders (or proposed holders) of our securities, refusing to permit the transfer of securities by such holders, suspending or limiting voting rights of such holders, redeeming or exchanging shares of our stock owned by such holders on terms set forth in our certificate of incorporation, and taking other actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions.\nThe terms and conditions of our rights with respect to our redemption or exchange right in respect of shares held by foreign persons or Contravening Persons are as follows:\n\u2022\nRedemption price or exchange value: Generally, the redemption price or exchange value for any shares of our common stock redeemed or exchanged would be their fair market value. However, if we redeem or exchange shares held by foreign persons or Contravening Persons and our Board in good faith determines that such person knew or should have known that its ownership would constitute a foreign ownership review event (other than shares for which our Board determined at the time of the person\u2019s purchase that the ownership of, or exercise of rights with respect to, such shares did not at such time constitute an Adverse Regulatory Occurrence), the redemption price or exchange value is required to be the lesser of fair market value and the person\u2019s purchase price for the shares redeemed or exchanged.\n\u2022\nForm of payment: Cash, securities or a combination, valued by our Board in good faith.\n\u2022\nNotice: At least 30 days written notice of redemption is required; however, if we have deposited the cash or securities for the redemption or exchange in trust for the benefit of the relevant holders, we may redeem shares held by such holders on the same day that we provide notice.\nAccordingly, there are situations in which a foreign stockholder or Contravening Person could lose the right to vote its shares or in which we may redeem or exchange shares held by a foreign person or Contravening Person and in which such redemption or exchange could be at the lesser of fair market value and the person\u2019s purchase price for the shares redeemed or exchanged, which could result in a significant loss for that person.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and in our charter, bylaws and in the indenture governing our PIK Toggle Notes could delay or prevent an acquisition of us.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire control of our company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. Our certificate of incorporation, or charter, establishes restrictions on foreign ownership of our securities. Other provisions of our charter and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors. These various restrictions could deprive shareholders of the opportunity to realize takeover premiums for their shares. In addition, the indenture governing our PIK Toggle Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the PIK Toggle Notes. These and other provisions could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to stockholders.", "PERMNO": 86233, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "LEU"}
