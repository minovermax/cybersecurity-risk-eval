{"cik": "1036262", "company": "INTEST CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our future performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks facing us and we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may adversely affect our business. However, these risks and uncertainties are the most significant factors that we have identified at this time. If one or more of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could suffer, and the price of our stock could be negatively affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO COVID-19\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the first half of 2020, our business was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second half of the year, the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business was reduced significantly. However, COVID-19 continues to cause disruptions, both domestically and globally, and we believe the situation will remain challenging until the spread of the virus or variants of the virus can be contained which we believe will not occur until the global dissemination and inoculation of recently introduced vaccines is substantially complete. As of the date of this filing, all of our operations continue to be deemed \u201ccritical and essential business operations\u201d under the various governmental COVID-19 mandates which has allowed us to continue to operate our business with certain modifications. The spread of the virus or variants of the virus could worsen and one or more of our significant customers or suppliers could be impacted, or significant additional governmental regulations and restrictions could be imposed, thus negatively impacting our business in the future.\nWe have had occasions where one or more employees have contracted COVID-19 and entered our facilities while infected. We have managed these occurrences with minimal disruption to our business while protecting other employees, but there can be no assurances that we can avoid similar occurrences in the future or that, in such cases, we can avoid significant disruption of our operations as a result of such occurrences. Should this occur, or should we have employees who become ill or otherwise are unable to work as a result of COVID-19, we may experience limitations in employee resources or may be required to close affected facilities for a time to clean and disinfect appropriately, and allow employees to quarantine, as appropriate.\nOur net revenues from all of the markets we serve were significantly affected by COVID-19 during the first half of 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on our net revenues from the Semi Market was intensified during the first half of the year because our business operations were also being negatively affected by a global downturn in the Semi Market at that time. We believe the level of increase in our orders from the Semi Market during the fourth quarter of 2020 reflects a combination of increased demand in the market resulting from the interruption of the normal recovery in the Semi Market cycle caused by the onset of COVID-19 in the first half of 2020, as well as increased demand for semiconductors, generally. If the trend in our orders from customers in the Semi Market declines, in particular, if the spread of COVID-19 is not further contained and one or more of our significant customers is negatively impacted, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. In addition, the aftermarket service and support that we provide to our customers has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by COVID-19 due to travel restrictions and limitations on visitors allowed into customer facilities, which has resulted in some of these activities being reduced or suspended.\nGenerally, global supply chains and the timely availability of products have been materially disrupted by quarantines, factory slowdowns or shutdowns, border closings and travel restrictions resulting from COVID-19. To date, we have not experienced significant price increases or lack of availability from our normal suppliers for the materials needed to produce our products in a timely manner and/or with the level of margins we typically expect to achieve. However, if the spread of COVID-19 or its variants is not further contained and one or more of our significant suppliers is negatively impacted, we could experience delays in receipt of materials or price increases in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business could be material in future periods, particularly if there are significant and prolonged economic slowdowns in regions where we derive a significant amount of our revenue or profit, or where our suppliers are located, or if we are forced to close facilities and limit or cease manufacturing operations for extended periods of time. We could experience delays in receipt of customer orders, cancellation or postponement of existing orders. Further, as a result of COVID-19, our ability to fulfill orders within the proposed parameters at the time of order, including within the approximated timeline and estimated cost, may be negatively affected. This could lead to a reduction in revenue and/or an increase in our cost of revenues in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. COVID-19 has also led to extreme volatility in capital markets and has adversely affected, and may adversely affect, the market price of our common stock in the future. As a result of any negative impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, we may determine that our goodwill and long-lived assets are impaired, which would result in recording an impairment charge. The amount of any such impairment charge could be material.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR MARKETS\nOur sales are affected by the cyclicality of the Semi Market, which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Capital expenditures by these companies depend upon, among other things, the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them. Typically, semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downturn. Conversely, semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products. These market changes have contributed in the past, and will likely continue to contribute in the future, to fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe seek to further diversify the markets for our thermal products in order to increase the proportion of our sales attributable to markets which are less subject to cyclicality than the Semi Market. If we are unable to do so, our future performance will remain substantially exposed to the fluctuations of the cyclicality of the Semi Market.\nSince 2009, we have sold our thermal products in markets outside of the Semi Market, including the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical and telecommunications markets. We refer to these other markets collectively as Multimarket. During 2020 and 2019, our Multimarket sales were $27.0 million and $29.7 million, respectively, and represented 50% and 49% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Prior to our acquisition of Ambrell, we offered only highly specialized engineering solutions in Multimarket, the demand for which is limited and which we expect may vary significantly from period to period. Our goal is to increase our Multimarket sales; however, in most cases, the expansion of our thermal product sales into these new markets has occurred in the last several years, and we may experience difficulty in expanding our sales efforts further into these markets. These difficulties could include hiring sales and marketing staff with sufficient experience selling into these new markets and our ability to continue to develop products which meet the needs of customers in these markets and which are not currently offered by our competitors. In addition, due to the highly specialized nature of certain of our product offerings in Multimarket, we do not expect broad market penetration in many of these markets. If we are unable to expand our Multimarket sales, our net revenues and results of operations will remain substantially dependent upon the cycles of the Semi Market.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nThe efficiencies or benefits we expect from the consolidation of our EMS manufacturing operations may not be realized which could result in higher-than-expected costs in future periods, a negative impact on our reputation and lost business opportunities.\nOn September 21, 2020, we notified employees in our Fremont, California facility of a plan to consolidate all manufacturing operations for our EMS segment into our manufacturing operations located in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey. Prior to the consolidation, our interface products were manufactured in the Fremont facility, and our manipulator and docking hardware products were manufactured in the Mt. Laurel facility. The consolidation was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. We are also currently in the process of reducing the size of our manufacturing facility in Mt. Laurel from approximately 55,000 square feet to approximately 34,000 square feet. The consolidation of manufacturing operations and footprint reduction in the Mt. Laurel facility were undertaken to better serve customers through streamlined operations and reduce the fixed annual operating costs for the EMS segment. A small engineering and sales office will be maintained in northern California. If we do not achieve the efficiencies and benefits we currently anticipate as a result of the consolidation, or if we determine that the reduction in manufacturing space is not sustainable, our costs could be higher than we currently expect in future periods.\nThe EMS facility consolidation resulted in the termination of certain employees at the Fremont location, including all of our interface product line assembly staff who were located at that facility. As a result of transitioning our interface manufacturing operations to New Jersey, we have hired new production staff for this product line in our Mt. Laurel facility. These new employees are being trained to assemble our products and therefore are not yet as efficient or experienced as the employees that were terminated in the Fremont location. As a result, we may experience increased lead times for our interface products for the next several months which could impact customer shipments as well as quality of our interface products. This may be further exacerbated by the recent surge in demand that we have experienced for our EMS products. If we do not meet our customers\u2019 expectations for on-time delivery and quality, this could impact our reputation and result in lost business opportunities. Additionally, we may incur higher levels of warranty costs over the next several months as a result of the potential inability to meet customer quality requirements. This could increase our costs in future periods. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in future periods.\nIf our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements, we could have reduced revenues and earnings.\nCertain components of our products may be in short supply from time to time because of high demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. A significant portion of our material purchases require some custom work, and there are not always multiple suppliers capable of performing such custom work on a timely or cost-effective basis. If any of our suppliers were to cancel commitments or fail to meet quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, have reduced revenues and earnings, and be subject to contractual penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business, our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. A failure in, or a breach of, our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, result in litigation, damage our reputation, cause losses and significantly increase our costs. Although we have been the target of security breaches in the past, we have not experienced material losses to date related to such incidents. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. In addition, domestic and international regulatory agencies have implemented, and are continuing to implement, various reporting and remediation requirements that companies must comply with upon learning of a breach. While we have insurance that may protect us from incurring some of these costs, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage is adequate to cover all costs and damages incurred in connection with a cyberattack.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees or hire personnel at the costs we currently project.\nOur future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and other key employees or the development of successors with commensurate skills and talents in a timely fashion and at the costs we project. If we cannot continue to increase employee salaries and maintain employee benefits commensurate with competitive opportunities, we may not be able to retain our senior management and other key employees. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and could increase our costs in future periods.\nWe have recently experienced difficulty in hiring personnel at the costs projected in our forecasts. This has resulted in the need to increase the labor rates offered for certain positions. If we cannot find savings in other areas or increase the price for which we sell our products in an amount sufficient to cover these additional labor costs, we may experience reduced margins in future periods.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience significant variability in our effective tax rates and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and costs.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various other countries in which we operate. Our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the U.S. and other countries. We are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate. Any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could negatively affect our financial results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR AQUISITION STRATEGY\nWe seek to grow our business through the acquisition of additional businesses. If we are unable to do so, our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited. We may incur significant expenses related to due diligence or other transaction-related expenses for a proposed acquisition that may not be completed.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses, technologies or products that are complementary to our current product offerings. We seek to make acquisitions that will further expand our product lines as well as strengthen our positions in served markets and provide expansion into new markets. We may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy and our future growth may be limited if:\n\u25cf\nwe are unable to identify suitable businesses, technologies or products to acquire;\n\u25cf\nwe do not have sufficient cash or access to required capital at the necessary time;\n\u25cf\nwe are unwilling or unable to outbid larger, more resourceful companies; or\n\u25cf\nwe are unable to successfully close proposed acquisitions.\nWe may incur significant expenses related to due diligence or other transaction-related expenses for a proposed acquisition that may not be completed, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our results in the future.\nIf we acquire additional businesses, technologies or products, we will face the following additional risks:\n\u25cf\nfuture acquisitions could divert management's attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management, operational and financial resources;\n\u25cf\nwe might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably;\n\u25cf\nwe may realize substantial acquisition related expenses that would reduce our net earnings in future years; and\n\u25cf\nour investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire.\nIf any of the events described above occur, our earnings could be reduced. If we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions, we would dilute our existing stockholders' interests and our earnings per share may decrease. If we issue or incur debt in connection with any future acquisitions, lenders may require that we pledge our assets to secure repayment of such debt and impose covenants on us, which could, among other things, restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses.\nWe may attempt to acquire a substantial business that would require us to issue equity or incur significant debt from third parties. If we are unable to secure sufficient financing at terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to close the proposed acquisition. Additionally, should we incur significant debt, we may not be able to achieve compliance with all covenants related to the debt depending on our financial results in future periods.\nIn connection with our acquisition strategy, we are pursuing potential acquisition opportunities that may be significant in size compared to us, which could require us to issue equity or obtain significant third-party financing to close the proposed transaction. We may encounter difficulties in securing necessary financing at terms that would be acceptable to us and may not be able to close on the proposed acquisition. In addition, should we incur significant third-party debt, our future financial results may be negatively impacted by external factors, such as an economic recession, which may impact our ability to achieve compliance with any covenants related to the debt as well as make the required payments under the terms of the indebtedness.\nWe may acquire businesses in the future and utilize an earnout structure as we have done in prior transactions we have closed. In connection with the earnout, we may be required to accrue significant increases or decreases to the contingent consideration liability we would establish. These adjustments to the contingent consideration liability could cause our results of operations to have increased variability, which may negatively impact our stock\u2019s trading price.\nWe may utilize an earnout structure on future acquisitions as we have done in prior transactions we have closed. The initial contingent consideration liability is established as part of the accounting for the business combination. In subsequent periods, we are required to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with any earnout on a quarterly basis and record an adjustment to the contingent consideration liability in our results of operations for the period concerned. The contingent consideration adjustment we record quarterly may cause increased variability in our future results of operations, which may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE\nChanges in the buying patterns of our customers have affected, and may continue to affect, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins. Such changes in patterns are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent.\nIn addition to the cyclicality of the Semi Market, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins have also been affected by changes in the buying patterns of our customers. Some of the changes in customer buying patterns that have impacted us in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, have included customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times (which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity and may result in increasing unit costs) and ordering in smaller quantities (which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower unit costs.) We have also experienced customer supply chain management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors. We believe some of the changes in customer buying patterns are the result of changes within the Semi Market over the last several years, including, for example, changing product requirements and longer time periods between new product offerings by OEMs. Such shifts in market practices have had, and may continue to have, varying degrees of impact on our net revenues and our gross and net operating margins. Such shifts are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent, and the impact of these practices is difficult to quantify from period to period. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing effective strategies to counter these shifts.\nWe generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of our large customers, our operating results could suffer dramatically.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Texas Instruments Incorporated accounted for 10% of our consolidated net revenues. While both of our operating segments sold products to this customer, these revenues were primarily generated by our EMS segment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, no other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 35% and 34% of our consolidated net revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The loss of any one or more of our largest customers, or a reduction in orders by a major customer could materially reduce our net revenues or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nOur business is subject to intense competition, which has in the past and could in the future, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world in each of our operating segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than us. Some of our competitors are much smaller than we are, and therefore have much lower levels of overhead than us, which enables them to sell their competing products at lower prices. In order to remain competitive, we must continually commit a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or technologies. In the recent past, in response to significant declines in global demand for our products, some competitors have reduced their product pricing significantly, which has led to intensified price-based competition, which has and could continue to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and our business prospects would be negatively affected if we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to innovation in the Semi Market.\nSemiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ICs into an increasing variety of products. This trend, and the changes needed in automated testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor market, are likely to continue. We cannot be certain that we will be successful or timely in developing, manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or that will attain market acceptance. Our failure to provide products that effectively and timely meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will negatively affect our business prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nClaims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer's rights. These claims, regardless of merit, may consume valuable management time, result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays. Any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results. We may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may be costly to us. If we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms, our business could suffer. In instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others, or that someone may be infringing our patent rights, we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question, as well as the potentially infringing conduct. If we become involved in a dispute, neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel's conclusions.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OEPRATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE\nOur operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In addition to these changing cycles of demand, other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past or that may cause fluctuations and losses in the future, include:\n\u25cf\nthe impact of COVID-19 or any other pandemic on our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in demand in Multimarket including the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical and telecommunication markets;\n\u25cf\nthe state of the U.S. and global economies;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the buying patterns of our customers including any changes in the rate of, and timing of, purchases by our customers;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of interruptions in our supply chain caused by external factors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our market share;\n\u25cf\ncosts related to due diligence and transaction-related expenses for a proposed acquisition that does not get completed;\n\u25cf\ncosts and timing of integration of our acquisitions and plant consolidations and relocations;\n\u25cf\nthe technological obsolescence of our inventories;\n\u25cf\nquantities of our inventories greater than is reasonably likely to be utilized in future periods;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the level of product warranty charges;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nexcess manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf\nour ability to control operating costs;\n\u25cf\ndelays in shipments of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe mix of our products sold;\n\u25cf\nthe mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the level of our fixed costs;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with the development of our proprietary technology;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed;\n\u25cf\nincreases in costs of component materials;\n\u25cf\ncancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers;\n\u25cf\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u25cf\npolitical or economic instability.\nBecause the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on, and in relation to, changes in our operating results, fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue.\nRISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS\nA substantial portion of our customers are located outside the U.S., which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks.\nWe have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non-U.S. customers. Our foreign subsidiaries generated 14% and 15% of consolidated net revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net revenues from foreign customers totaled $31.6 million, or 59% of consolidated net revenues in 2020, and $35.4 million, or 58% of consolidated net revenues in 2019. We expect our net revenues from foreign customers will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues. In addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the U.S., sales to customers outside the U.S. and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks, which may, in the future, affect our operations. These risks include:\n\u25cf\nthe effects of COVID-19 on markets outside the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nthe effects of certain foreign customers being added to the list of restricted customers by the U.S. Department of Commerce;\n\u25cf\nthe implementation of trade tariffs by the U.S. and other countries that would impact our products;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments;\n\u25cf\nthe need to comply with a wide variety of U.S. and foreign import and export laws;\n\u25cf\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ntrade restrictions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in taxes;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u25cf\nthe greater difficulty of administering business abroad.\nA significant portion of our cash position is maintained overseas and we may not be able to repatriate cash from overseas when necessary, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWhile much of our cash is in the U.S., a significant portion is generated from and maintained by our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2020, $3.2 million, or 31%, of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S. to address our cash requirements and if we are unable to efficiently and timely repatriate cash from overseas. Any payment of distributions, loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. If we are unable to repatriate the earnings of our subsidiaries, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to redeploy earnings in other jurisdictions where they could be used more profitably.", "PERMNO": 85013, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "INTT"}
