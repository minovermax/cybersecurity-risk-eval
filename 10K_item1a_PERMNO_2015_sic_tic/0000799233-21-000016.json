RISK FACTORS\nOur future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements as discussed in \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above. The following issues, uncertainties, and risks, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook. If any of the following risk factors, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material, actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all or a significant part of your investment.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur business is subject to economic, credit, business, and regulatory factors affecting the trucking industry that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe truckload industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets, such as:\n\u2022 recessionary economic cycles, which are characterized by weak demand and downward pressure on freight rates;\n\u2022 downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, including as a result of declines in consumer spending;\n\u2022 changes in customers\u2019 inventory levels and practices, including shrinking product/package size, and in the availability of funding for their working capital;\n\u2022 excess tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry in comparison with shipping demand;\n\u2022 changes in the way our customers choose to source or utilize our services;\n\u2022 the rate of unemployment and availability of and compensation for alternative jobs for truck drivers, which impact the pool of available drivers and our driver compensation costs;\n\u2022 activity in key economic indicators such as manufacturing of automobiles and durable goods, and housing construction;\n\u2022 supply chain disruptions due to factors such as weather and railroad or ports congestion; and\n\u2022 rising costs of healthcare.\nEconomic conditions that decrease shipping demand and increase the supply of available tractors and trailers can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the U.S. economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times are as follows:\n\u2022 we may experience a reduction in overall freight levels, which may impair our asset utilization;\n\u2022 certain of our customers may face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems that may lead to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could result in even lower freight demand and may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u2022 freight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between our capacity and our customers\u2019 freight demand;\n\u2022 customers may solicit bids for freight from multiple trucking companies or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight;\n\u2022 we may be forced to accept freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads; and\n\u2022 the resale value of our equipment may decline, which could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.\nWe also are subject to potential increases in various costs and other events that are outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Further, we may be unable to appropriately adjust our costs and staffing levels to changing market demands.\nIn addition, we cannot predict future economic conditions, fuel price fluctuations, revenue equipment resale values, or how consumer confidence, macroeconomic conditions, or production capabilities, could be affected by actual or threatened outbreaks of disease or other public health risks, armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, government efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements. Enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nOur growth may not continue at historical rates, if at all, and any decrease in revenues or profits may impair our ability to implement our business strategy, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant growth in revenue and profits, although there have been times, particularly after acquisitions, when our revenue and/or profitability decreased. There can be no assurance that our business will grow in a similar fashion in the future, or at all, or that we can effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any future growth. Further, there can be no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions.\nWe have established terminals throughout the contiguous U.S. in order to serve markets in various regions. These regional operations require the commitment of additional personnel and revenue equipment, as well as management resources, for future development and establishing terminals and operations in new markets could require more time, resources or a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated. Should the growth in our regional operations stagnate or decline, the results of our operations could be adversely affected. If we seek to further expand, it may become more difficult to identify large cities that can support a terminal and we may expand into smaller cities where there is insufficient economic activity, fewer opportunities for growth and fewer drivers and non-driver personnel to support the terminal. We may encounter operating conditions in these new markets, as well as our current markets, that differ substantially from our current operations and customer relationships and appropriate freight rates in new markets could be challenging to attain. We may not be able to duplicate or sustain our operating strategy and establishing service centers or terminals and operations in new markets could require more time or resources, or a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated. These challenges may negatively impact our growth, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy and our results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to improve our profitability, limit growth opportunities, and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNumerous competitive factors present in our industry could impair our ability to maintain or improve our current profitability, limit our prospects for growth, and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. These factors include the following:\n\u2022 we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, intermodal companies, and other transportation and logistics companies, many of which have access to more equipment and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022 many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain or expand our business or may require us to reduce our freight rates in order to maintain business and keep our equipment productive;\n\u2022 we may increase the size of our fleet during periods of high freight demand during which our competitors also increase their capacity, and we may experience losses in greater amounts than such competitors during subsequent cycles of softened freight demand if we are required to dispose of assets at a loss to match reduced customer demand;\n\u2022 a significant portion of our business is in the retail industry, which continues to undergo a shift away from the traditional brick and mortar model towards e-commerce, and this shift could impact the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services;\n\u2022 many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called \"core carriers\" as approved service providers or by engaging dedicated providers, and we may not be selected;\n\u2022 the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size, and we may have difficulty competing with these larger carriers;\n\u2022 the market for qualified drivers is increasingly competitive, and our inability to attract and retain drivers could reduce our equipment utilization or cause us to increase compensation to our drivers, both of which would adversely affect our profitability;\n\u2022 competition from freight logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates; and\n\u2022 the Heartland and Millis Transfer brand names are valuable assets that are subject to the risk of adverse publicity (whether or not justified),which could result in the loss of value attributable to our brand and reduced demand for our services.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future, or if we do, we may not be successful in integrating the acquired company, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, acquisitions have been a part of our growth. There is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. If we fail to make any future acquisitions, our historical growth rate could be materially and adversely affected. If we succeed in consummating future acquisitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations, may be materially adversely affected because:\n\u2022 some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flows;\n\u2022 we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or otherwise exceed our estimates;\n\u2022 we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, or at all, and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems;\n\u2022 acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management, and divert our resources;\n\u2022 we may experience difficulties operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience;\n\u2022 we may incur transaction costs and acquisition-related integration costs;\n\u2022 we could lose customers, employees, and drivers of any acquired company;\n\u2022 we may experience potential future impairment charges, write-offs, write-downs, or restructuring charges; and\n\u2022 we may issue dilutive equity securities, incur indebtedness, and/or incur large one-time expenses.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nIncreases in driver compensation or difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, including independent contractors, may have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and the ability to maintain or grow our fleet.\nLike many truckload carriers, we experience substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers which includes to a lesser extent, our engagement of independent contractors. Independent contractors currently represent a small portion of our fleet. The truckload industry is subject to a shortage of qualified drivers. Such shortage is exacerbated during periods of economic expansion, in which alternative employment opportunities, such as those in the construction and manufacturing industries, are more plentiful and freight demand increases. Furthermore, capacity at driving schools may be limited by COVID-19 related social distancing requirements. Regulatory requirements, including those related to safety ratings, ELDs and HOS changes, drug and alcohol testing national database, an improved economy, and aging of the driver workforce, could further reduce the pool of eligible drivers or force us to increase driver compensation to attract and retain drivers. We have seen evidence that CSA, the drug and alcohol clearing house, and stricter HOS regulations adopted by the DOT in the past have tightened, and, to the extent new regulations are enacted, may continue to tighten, the market for eligible drivers. The lack of adequate tractor parking along some U.S. highways and congestion caused by inadequate highway funding may make it more difficult for drivers to comply with HOS regulations and cause added stress for drivers, further reducing the pool of eligible drivers. Further, the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions, and we may find it necessary to increase driver compensation in future periods.\nIn addition, we and many other truckload carriers suffer from a high turnover rate of drivers that is inherent within our industry. This high turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing revenue equipment. We also employ driver hiring standards which we believe are more rigorous than the hiring standards employed in general in our industry and could further reduce the pool of available drivers from which we would hire. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers, we could be forced to, among other things, adjust our compensation packages, increase the number of our tractors without drivers, or operate with fewer tractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe generate a significant portion of our operating revenue from a small number of our major customers. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our major customers. A substantial portion of our freight is from customers in the retail industry. As such, our volumes are largely dependent on consumer spending and retail sales, and our results may be more susceptible to trends in unemployment and retail sales than carriers that do not have this concentration. In addition, our major customers\nengage in bid processes and other activities periodically (including currently) in an attempt to lower their costs of transportation. We may not choose to participate in these bids or, if we participate, may not be awarded the freight, either of which could result in a reduction of our freight volumes with these customers. In this event, we could be required to replace the volumes elsewhere at uncertain rates and volumes, suffer reduced equipment utilization, or reduce the size of our fleet. In addition, the size and market concentration of some of our customers may allow them to exert increased pressure on the prices, margins and non-monetary terms of our contracts. Failure to retain our existing customers, or enter into relationships with new customers, each on acceptable terms, could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to meet our current and long-term financial forecasts.\nOur customers\u2019 financial difficulties can negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, especially if they were to delay or default on payments to us. If any of our major customers experience financial hardship, the demand for our services could decrease which could negatively affect our operating results. Further, if one or more of our major customers were to seek protection under bankruptcy laws, we might not receive payment for a significant amount of services rendered and, under certain circumstances, might have to return certain payments made by such customers, which may cause an adverse impact on our profitability and operations. Generally, we do not have contractual relationships that guarantee any minimum volumes with our customers, and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect. Certain services we provide customers are subject to longer term written contracts. However, certain of these contracts contain cancellation clauses, including our \u201cevergreen\u201d contracts, which automatically renew for one year terms but that can be terminated more easily. There is no assurance any of our customers, including those with longer term contracts, will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, or continue at the same volume levels. Despite the existence of contractual arrangements with our customers, certain of our customers may nonetheless engage in competitive bidding processes that could negatively impact our contractual relationship. In addition, certain of our major customers may increasingly use their own truckload and delivery fleets, which would reduce our freight volumes. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers, including our customers with longer term contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf fuel prices increase significantly, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are dependent upon fuel. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic, weather-related, geographic and market factors that are outside our control and each of which may lead to fluctuations in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices also are affected by the rising demand for fuel in developing countries, and could be materially adversely affected by the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production and by diminished drilling activity. Such events may lead not only to increases in fuel prices, but also to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Fuel also is subject to regional pricing differences and is often more expensive in certain areas where we operate.\nBecause our operations are dependent upon fuel, significant increases in fuel costs, fuel shortages, rationings, or supply disruptions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges. Even if we are able to pass some increased costs on to customers, fuel surcharge programs generally do not protect us against all of the increases in fuel prices. Moreover, in times of rising fuel prices, the lag between purchasing the fuel, and the billing for the surcharge (which typically is based on the prior week's average price), can negatively impact our earnings and cash flows and lead to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement, which have occurred in the past. In addition, the terms of each customer's fuel surcharge agreement vary, and certain customers have sought to modify the terms of their fuel surcharge agreements to minimize recoverability for fuel price increases. During periods of low freight volumes, customers may use their negotiating leverage to impose fuel surcharge policies that provide a lower reimbursement of our fuel costs. There is no assurance that our fuel surcharge programs can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective. Our results of operations would be negatively affected to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge programs.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our management information and communication systems and other technology assets (and the data contained therein) and a system failure or unavailability, including those caused by cybersecurity breaches, or an inability to effectively upgrade such systems and assets could cause a significant disruption to our business and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information and communications systems and other technology assets, including the data contained therein and our communication system with our fleet of revenue equipment. We currently use centralized computer networks and regular communication to achieve system-wide load coordination for both Heartland and Millis. Our operating systems are critical to understanding customer demands, accepting and planning loads, dispatching equipment and drivers, and billing and collecting for our services. Our financial reporting system is critical to producing accurate and timely financial statements and analyzing business information to help us manage effectively. Furthermore, recently enacted data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act that became effective on January\n1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and operational requirements for companies, may result in increased liability and amplified compliance and monitoring costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business operations.\nOur operations and those of our technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, internet failures, computer viruses, deliberate attacks of unauthorized access to systems, denial-of-service attacks on websites, and other events beyond our control. More sophisticated and frequent cyberattacks in recent years have also increased security risks associated with information technology systems. We also maintain information security policies to protect our systems, networks, and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein) from cybersecurity breaches and threats, such as hackers, malware, and viruses; however, such policies cannot ensure the protection of our systems, networks, and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein). If any of our critical information systems fail or become otherwise unavailable, whether as a result of a system upgrade project or otherwise, we would have to perform the functions manually, which could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently, to respond to customers\u2019 requests effectively, to maintain billing and other records reliably, and to bill for services and prepare financial statements accurately or in a timely manner. We do not carry a cybersecurity insurance policy. Any significant system failure, upgrade complication, security breach (including cyberattacks), or other system disruption could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, or impact our ability to manage our operations and report our financial performance, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees or find, develop and retain a core group of managers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of several executive officers and key management employees. The loss of any of their services could have a negative impact on our operations and profitability. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees or executive officers. Turnover, planned or otherwise, in these or other key leadership positions may materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business efficiently and effectively, and such turnover can be disruptive and distracting to management, may lead to additional departures of existing personnel, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future profitability. We must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth. Failing to develop and retain a core group of managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events affect our operations and profitability.\nWeather and other seasonal events could adversely affect our operating results. Our tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling, while harsh weather creates higher accident frequency, increased claims, and more equipment repairs. In addition, many of our customers, particularly those in the retail industry where we have a large presence, demand additional capacity during the fourth quarter, which limits our ability to take advantage of more attractive market rates that generally exist during such periods. Further, despite our efforts to meet such demands, we may fail to do so, which may result in lost future business opportunities with such customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operations. Recently, the duration of this increased period of demand in the fourth quarter has shortened, with certain customers requiring the same volume of shipments over a more condensed timeframe, resulting in increased stress and demand on our network, people, and systems. If this trend continues, it could make satisfying our customers and maintaining the quality of our service during the fourth quarter increasingly difficult. We may also suffer from weather-related or other unforeseen events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets, or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile.\nCOMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could significantly increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings.\nOur future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. Our business results in a substantial number of claims and litigation related to workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, personal injuries, and employment issues as well as employees\u2019 health insurance. We self-insure for a portion of our claims, which could increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings, and could have a\nmaterially adverse effect on our results of operations. See Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our self-insured retention amounts. We are also responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims. We reserve currently for anticipated losses and related expenses. We periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect trends in our own experience as well as industry trends. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties, including evaluation of severity, legal costs, and claims that have been incurred but not reported, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. Due to our high retained amounts, we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If we are required to reserve or pay additional amounts because our estimates are revised or the claims ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed or if our self-insured retention levels change, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain insurance for most risks above the amounts for which we self-insure with licensed insurance carriers. We do not currently maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance coverage, although we are obligated to indemnify them against certain liabilities they may incur while serving in such capacities. If any claim is not covered by an insurance policy, exceeds our coverage, or falls outside the aggregate coverage limit, we would bear the excess or uncovered amount, in addition to our other self-insured amounts. Insurance carriers that provide excess insurance coverage to us currently and for past claim years have encountered financial issues. Recently there have been several insurance carriers that have exited the excess reinsurance market. Insurance carriers have recently raised premiums and collateral requirements for many businesses, including trucking companies. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could likely increase if we have a similar experience at renewal, or we could find it necessary to raise our self-insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. At our last policy renewal in April 2020, we reduced our excess insurance coverage. Should these expenses increase, we become unable to find excess coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, we experience a claim for which we do not have coverage, or we have to increase our reserves or collateral, there could be a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe, our drivers, and our equipment are regulated by the DOT, the EPA, the DHS, and other agencies in the states in which we operate. For further discussion of the laws and regulations applicable to us, our drivers, and our equipment, please see \u201cRegulation\u201d under \u201cItem 1: Business.\u201d Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs on to us through higher prices could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our independent contractors are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhile the size of our independent contractor fleet has been significantly reduced, independent contractors have historically comprised a portion of our fleet. Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers' compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to heighten the penalties of companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees' overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with these initiatives. Additionally, courts in certain states have issued recent decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers\u2019 compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. Our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. While we have been successful in continuing to classify our independent contractor drivers as independent contractors and not employees, we may be unsuccessful in defending that position in the future. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. For further discussion of the laws impacting the classification of independent contractors, please see \"Regulation\" under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nDevelopments in labor and employment law and any unionizing efforts by employees could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face the risk that Congress, federal agencies, or one or more states could approve legislation or regulations significantly affecting our businesses and our relationship with our employees, which would have substantially liberalized the procedures for union organizations. None of our domestic employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, but any attempt by our employees to organize a labor union could result in increased legal and other associated costs. Additionally, given the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s \u201cspeedy election\u201d rule, our ability to timely and effectively address any unionizing efforts would be difficult. If we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with our domestic employees, the terms could materially adversely affect our costs, efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations. Failure to comply with existing or future labor and employment laws could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. For further discussion of the labor and employment laws, please see \"Regulation\" under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nThe CSA program adopted by the FMCSA could adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, and our customer relationships.\nUnder CSA, fleets are evaluated and ranked against their peers based on certain safety-related standards. As a result, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to peer carriers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruitment by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, limit the pool of available drivers, or could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we may incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores.\nWe have in the past exceeded the FMCSA's established intervention thresholds in certain of the seven CSA safety-related categories. Based on these unfavorable ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. We have put procedures in place in an attempt to address areas where we have exceeded the thresholds. However, we cannot assure you these measures will be effective.\nReceipt of an unfavorable DOT safety rating could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe currently have satisfactory DOT ratings, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations as customer contracts may require a satisfactory DOT safety rating, and a conditional or unsatisfactory rating could materially adversely affect or restrict our operations. Furthermore, any changes to the DOT safety rating could make it more difficult for us to receive a satisfactory rating.\nCompliance with various environmental laws and regulations may increase our costs of operations and non-compliance with such laws and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nIn addition to direct regulation under the DOT and related agencies, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, waste oil, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. Our truck terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred or could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of our facilities have waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. A small percentage of our freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects us to a wide array of regulations. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. For further discussion of environmental laws and regulations, please see \"Regulation\" under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties, or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business.\nThe approach of President Biden\u2019s administration to tariffs and other trade regulations is still uncertain. The imposition of additional tariffs or quotas or changes to certain trade agreements, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could, among other things, increase the costs of the materials and decrease the availability of certain materials used by our suppliers to produce new revenue equipment or increase the price of fuel. Such cost increases for our revenue equipment suppliers would likely be passed on to us, and to the extent fuel prices increase, we may not be able to fully recover such increases through rate increases or our fuel surcharge program, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, independent contractors, customers, vendors, government agencies, stockholders, and other parties through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, and other processes. Recently, trucking companies, including us, have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal breaks, rest periods, overtime eligibility, and failure to pay for all hours worked. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial settlements or damages by the defendants.\nThe outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may also be significant. Not all claims are covered by our insurance, and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, involve significant aggregate use of our self-insured retention amounts, or cause increases in future premiums, the resulting expenses could have a significant materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nIn addition, we may be subject, and have been subject in the past, to litigation resulting from trucking accidents. The number and severity of litigation claims may be worsened by distracted driving by both truck drivers and other motorists. These lawsuits have resulted, and may result in the future, in the payment of substantial settlements or damages and rising risk of higher insurance costs.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nThe incurrence of indebtedness under our Credit Agreement or lack of access to other financing sources could have adverse consequences on our future operations.\nHistorically, we have generally funded our growth, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other general corporate expenses through cash flows generated from operations. However, in 2013 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which was amended in August 2018 and currently provides for an unsecured revolving line of credit with the flexibility to borrow up to $100.0 million and provides for an additional $100.0 million of borrowing capacity based on defined provisions in the agreement. We had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020. If we need to incur indebtedness in the future, any borrowings we make under the Credit Agreement, or from other sources could have adverse consequences on our future operations by reducing the availability of our future cash flows, limiting our flexibility regarding future expenditures, and making us more vulnerable to changes in the industry and economy. Our Credit Agreement expires in August 2021. To the extent we are unable to renew our credit facility on similar terms to the existing credit facility, could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Further, if borrowings under the Credit Agreement become unavailable, including because of recent significant fines or future regulatory actions and fines, judgements, or settlements, imposed upon Wells Fargo, and we need to obtain financing from other sources, we may be unable to obtain terms as favorable as the current terms of the Credit Agreement, or to secure financing at all, which could have adverse consequences on our future operations.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely impacted if our capital investments do not match customer demand or if there is a decline in the availability of funding sources for these investments.\nOur operations require significant capital investments. The amount and timing of such investments depend on various factors, including anticipated freight demand and the price and availability of assets. If anticipated demand differs materially from actual usage, we may have too many or too few assets. Moreover, resource requirements vary based on customer demand, which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions. During periods of decreased customer demand, our asset utilization may suffer, and we may be forced to sell equipment on the open market or turn in equipment under certain\nequipment leases, if any, in order to right size our fleet. This could cause us to incur losses on such sales or require payments in connection with the return of such equipment, particularly during times of a softer used equipment market, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability. Our ability to select profitable freight and adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is important to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers.\nOur historical policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts annually to maintain a newer average age for our fleet of revenue equipment. We expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations, proceeds from sales of equipment being replaced, and with proceeds of borrowings if necessary. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, or proceeds from sales of equipment being replaced, or utilize borrowing capacity on our Credit Agreement, we would need to seek alternative sources of capital, including additional financing, to meet our capital requirements. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain additional financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nIncreased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, decreased availability of new revenue equipment, and decreased demand for and value of used equipment could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and profitability.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new tractors and trailers. We have at times experienced an increase in prices for new tractors and the resale values of the tractors have not always increased to the same extent. Prices have increased and may continue to increase, due to, among other reasons, (i) increases in commodity prices, (ii) government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors, trailers, and diesel engines, and (iii) the pricing discretion of equipment manufacturers. In addition, we have recently equipped our tractors with safety, aerodynamic, and other options that increase the price of new equipment. Compliance with governmental regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of new trailers, could impair equipment productivity, in some cases, result in lower fuel mileage, and increase our operating expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses for the foreseeable future.\nTractor and trailer vendors may reduce their manufacturing output in response to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or shortages of component parts. A decrease in vendor output may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to purchase a quantity of new revenue equipment that is sufficient to sustain our desired growth rate and to maintain a late-model fleet. Moreover, an inability to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nThe market for used equipment is cyclical and can be volatile, and any downturn in the market could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows. During periods of higher used equipment values, we have recognized significant gains on the sale of our used tractors and trailers, in part because of a strong used equipment market and our historical practice of capitalizing on changes in the used equipment market. Conversely, during periods of lower used equipment values, we may generate lower gains on sale, or even losses, or we may have to record impairments of the carrying value of our equipment, any of which would reduce our earnings and cash flows, and could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Alternatively, we could decide, or be forced, to operate our equipment longer, which could negatively impact maintenance and repairs expense, customer service, and driver satisfaction.\nWe could determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, thus recognizing a related loss.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of $168.3 million and other intangible assets of $24.7 million. We evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. We could recognize impairments in the future, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. If these events occur, our profitability and financial condition will suffer.\nConcentrated ownership of our stock can influence stockholder decisions, may discourage a change in control, and may have an adverse effect on share price of our stock.\nInvestors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock. The Gerdin family, our directors, and our executive officers, as a group, own or control approximately 41% of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This ownership concentration may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control, and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares. As a result of their ownership, the Gerdin family, the executive officers and directors, as a group, may have the ability to influence the outcome of any matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nThis concentration of ownership could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay for our common stock, and could allow the Gerdin family to prevent or could discourage or delay a change of control, which other stockholders may favor. Further, our bylaws have been amended to \u201copt out\u201d of the Nevada control share statute. Accordingly, an acquisition of more than a majority of our common stock by the Gerdin family will not result in certain shares in excess of a majority losing their voting rights and may enhance the Gerdin family's ability to exercise control over decisions affecting us. The interests of the Gerdin family may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock, and they may take actions affecting us with which other stockholders disagree.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, stock markets generally experience significant price and volume volatility from time to time which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our performance.\nCOVID-19 RISKS\nWe could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks.\nWe have experienced an increase in absences or terminations among our driver and non-driver personnel due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which have disrupted our operations. Further, our operations, particularly in areas of increased COVID-19 infections, could be disrupted. Negative financial results, operational disruptions, driver and non-driver absences, uncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, other similar outbreaks, or a recession, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and reduce credit options available to us.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that the current outbreak has caused a slowdown in the global economy and the duration of the contraction remains uncertain. Risks related to a slowdown or recession are described in our risk factor titled \u201cOur business is subject to economic, credit, business, and regulatory factors affecting the trucking industry that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\u201d\nDevelopments related to COVID-19 have been unpredictable and the extent to which further developments could impact our operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain. Such developments may include the duration of the virus, the distribution and availability of vaccines, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.", "PERMNO": 10812, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "HTLD"}
