{"cik": "1396279", "company": "hhgregg, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nDescribed below are certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. The following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf related to conditions or events we anticipate may occur in the future. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks below.\nOur success depends upon our effective execution of our strategies.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively identify, develop and execute our strategies. In the upcoming year we intend to execute on key initiatives to grow revenue, increase productivity and the organization of our business as described in Item 7 \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview.\u201d During fiscal 2017, our focus remains on continuing the Company's return to profitable growth, building upon the efforts from fiscal 2016, and impacting the long-term health of the Company. However, it may take longer than expected to achieve our objectives, and actual results may be materially different than planned. Our ability to improve our operating results depends upon a significant number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ncustomer response to our marketing and merchandise strategies;\n\u2022\nour ability to properly deploy and utilize capital and other resources to better position our business to drive additional traffic and increase sales in our comparable store base;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and increase net sales in both new and existing product categories;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide customers with highly trained and consultative sales associates, best-in-class delivery and installation services and compelling financing offers;\n\u2022\nour ability to respond to competitive pressures in our industry and maintain our market share;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage inventory;\n\u2022\nthe success of our omnichannel strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability to benefit from capital improvements made to our store environment;\n\u2022\nour ability to access adequate and uninterrupted supply of merchandise from suppliers at expected levels and on acceptable terms; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nFailure to execute these initiatives and strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to increase sales and store productivity is largely dependent upon our ability to increase customer traffic and conversion.\nCustomer traffic depends upon our ability to successfully market compelling merchandise assortments as well as present an appealing shopping environment and experience to customers. Our marketing model utilizes all of the major channels for advertising with a focus on TV, print, digital and direct mail. As part of our strategic initiatives, we continually test a variety of marketing media mix tactics to learn and make adjustments between medias in order to efficiently and effectively reach our targeted customers to deliver sustainable profits. Our marketing strategy may fail to reach the intended market and may not be successful in generating incremental customer traffic or increasing conversion rates. This could result in a continued or accelerated reduction in customer traffic and conversion. Any such outcome, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may adversely affect our operating results. In addition, external events outside of our control, including pandemics, terrorist threats, domestic conflicts and civil unrest, may influence customers' decisions to visit stores or might otherwise cause customers to avoid public places. There is no assurance that we will be able to reverse any decline in traffic or that any such decline in store traffic will be offset by an increase in web sales. We may need to respond to any declines in\ncustomer traffic or conversion rates by increasing markdowns or promotions to attract customers, which could adversely impact our gross margins, operating results and cash flows from operating activities.\nThe retail industry that we compete in has strong competition from traditional store-based retailers, multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, our vendors, and other forms of retail e-commerce, which directly affects our sales and margins.\nThe retail industry for major home appliances, consumer electronics and home furniture is intensely competitive. We compete with many other local, regional, and national retailers, e-commerce retailers and certain of our vendors who offer products directly to consumers. Price is of primary importance to customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. Some online-only businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all U.S. states, which can negatively impact the ability of multi-channel retailers to be price competitive on a tax-included basis. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices to attract customers. Also, some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time. Our competitors may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including lower pricing, more aggressive advertising and marketing, enhanced product and service offerings, extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we make available, innovative store formats, including store within a store, improved retail sales methods, enhanced customer service experiences, online product offerings and expansion into markets where we currently operate.\nThe retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are becoming more demanding. Customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products which changes the way we interact with them. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. Our website, hhgregg.com, is a sales channel for our products, and is also a method of making product information available to customers that impacts our in-store sales. In addition to hhgregg.com, we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inform, cross-sell and otherwise interact with our customers. Our website is a significant component of our advertising strategy. In order to promote our products and services, allow our customers to complete credit applications in the privacy of their homes and drive traffic to our stores, we must effectively create, design, publish and distribute content over the internet. There can be no assurance that we will be able to design and publish web content with a high level of effectiveness or grow our e-commerce business in a profitable manner. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, puts pressure on our margins.\nIf we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and maintain positive brand perception and recognition or if there is a lack of new product introductions and innovation, our net sales and profitability may decline.\nOur products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our ability to maintain and increase net sales depends to a large extent on the periodic introduction and availability of new products and technologies. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to trends in consumer preferences relating to major household appliances and consumer electronics such as OLED and Ultra HD 4K televisions as well as alternative options for delivery of those products quickly and at a low-cost to consumers. Significant deviations from the anticipated consumer preferences for the products we sell or related services we provide could result in lost net sales and lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory. If we are unable to effectively introduce and sell new products to our customers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Conversely, if we fail to anticipate or react to consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages, which would result in lost sales and could negatively affect our customer goodwill, our brand image and our profitability.\nWe believe that a focus on customer service fosters the development of our brand recognition and reputation. If we are unable to maintain our high level of customer service, our brand recognition, reputation, business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, the increasing usage of web-based social media means that consumer feedback and other information about our Company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. The impact of such feedback could negatively affect our brand perception and recognition, and as a result could result in declines in customer loyalty, lower employee retention and productivity, vendor relationship issues and other factors, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to hire, train and retain key management, qualified managers, sales associates and other employees, we could have difficulty implementing our business strategy, which may result in reduced net sales, operating margins and profitability.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team and other key employees. A key element of our competitive strategy is to provide product expertise to our customers through our extensively trained, commissioned sales associates, which, we believe, results in more of our customers purchasing higher-margin, feature-rich products. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed in the future, our level of customer service may decline, which may decrease our net sales and profitability. Other factors that impact our ability to maintain sufficient levels of qualified employees in all areas of the business include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s reputation, employee morale, the current macroeconomic environment, competition from other employers and our ability to offer adequate compensation packages. Adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees. Our ability to control labor costs, which may impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations. If our labor and/or benefit costs increase, we may not be able to hire or maintain qualified personnel to the extent necessary to execute our competitive strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we do not maintain the security of customer, associate, or Company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.\nThe use and handling of personally identifiable data by us, our employees, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from consumer fraud, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate customer and other confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse affect on our reputation and may expose us to material costs, penalties, compensation claims, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, impact our credit card financing offers available to customers and potentially disrupt our business and have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers\ncould lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe offer private-label credit cards through third-party financial institutions that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Additionally, we offer secondary financing for lower-middle income customers that do not qualify for the private-label credit card and \u201clease to own\u201d financing, both of which are through third-party providers and non-recourse to our business. If any of our programs ended prematurely, the terms and provisions, or interpretations thereof, were substantially modified, or approval rates or types of financing offered to our customers amended, promotional financing volumes and our net sales and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively achieve our cost cutting initiatives could have a material adverse affect on our profitability.\nAs part of our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs, we have implemented numerous cost cutting initiatives. We plan to continue to implement additional cost cutting initiatives in fiscal 2017 and beyond. If we are unable to achieve, or have any unexpected delays in achieving, the anticipated cost savings and benefits associated with these initiatives, our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. The negative impact of consumer spending on our sales results makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. The competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency means that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, other store expenses or indirect spending could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nWe depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations.\nOur business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share. We borrow on occasion to finance our activities, and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms we needed, it could also adversely affect our financial performance.\nA disruption in our relationships with, or in the operations of, any of our key suppliers could cause our net sales and profitability to decline.\nThe success of our business and our growth strategy depends to a significant degree on our relationships with our suppliers. Our largest suppliers include Bosch, Curtis, Frigidaire, GE, Haier, Hewlett Packard, LG, Samsung, Sony and Whirlpool. Our top 10 and 20 suppliers represented 84.5% and 91.8%, respectively, of our purchases in fiscal 2016. The loss of any one or more of our key suppliers or our failure to establish and maintain terms with these and other suppliers could materially adversely affect our supply and assortment of products, as we may not be able to find suitable replacements to supply products at competitive prices. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers\u2019 logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers\u2019 control.\nIf products that we purchase from vendors are damaged or prove to be defective, we may not be able to return products to these vendors and obtain refunds or replacements of our purchase price or obtain other indemnification from them, which could have a material adverse affect on our net sales and results of operations.\nThe financial condition of our suppliers may also adversely affect their access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels and product quality and to operate their businesses, all of which could adversely affect our supply chain. Negative impacts on the financial condition of any of our suppliers may cause suppliers to reduce their offerings of customer incentives and vendor allowances, cooperative marketing expenditures and product promotions. It may also cause them to change their pricing policies, which could impact demand for their products. The current weakness in, and volatility of, the overall economy makes it difficult for us and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to carry too much or too little merchandise in various product categories.\nWe could incur additional charges due to impairment of long-lived assets.\nAt March 31, 2016, we had long-lived asset balances of $87.5 million, which are subject to periodic testing for impairment. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we have recorded impairment charges of $20.9 million and $47.9 million, respectively. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow generated from operations at individual store locations could result in additional impairment charges for the related fixed assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.\nAny failure of our e-commerce functions or other information technology infrastructure or management information systems could cause a disruption in our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur ability to operate our business from day to day largely depends on the efficient operation of our information technology infrastructure and management information systems. We use our management information systems to conduct our operations and for critical corporate and business planning functions, including store operations, sales management, merchandising, marketing, supply chain and inventory management, financial reporting and accounting, delivery and other customer services and various administrative functions. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. Operating legacy systems subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading and replacing these systems and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel to maintain and operate the systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs. Any failure that is not covered by our disaster recovery plan could cause an interruption in our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels or other technical difficulties, could cause us to forgo material revenues and adversely affect our reputation with consumers. Performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our business and negatively affect our customers\u2019 perceptions of hhgregg as a reliable online vendor and source of information about appliances, consumer electronics, furniture and other home products and services, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur comparable store sales may not be an indication of our future results of operations because they fluctuate\nsignificantly.\nOur historical comparable store sales figures have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable store sales results, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in competition, such as pricing pressure and the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nNew product introductions;\n\u2022\nConsumer trends;\n\u2022\nChanges in our marketing programs;\n\u2022\nChanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\nChanges in the relative sales price points of our major product categories;\n\u2022\nOur ability to offer attractive credit programs to our customers;\n\u2022\nWeather conditions in our markets;\n\u2022\nTiming of promotional events;\n\u2022\nReduction in new store openings;\n\u2022\nThe percentage of our stores that are mature stores;\n\u2022\nThe locations of our stores and the traffic drawn to those areas;\n\u2022\nHow often we update our stores; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to execute our business strategies effectively.\nChanges in our quarterly and annual comparable store sales results could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur business is dependent on the general economic conditions in our markets.\nIn general, our sales depend on discretionary spending by our customers. General economic factors and other conditions that may affect our business include periods of slow economic growth or recession, political factors including uncertainty in social or fiscal policy, an overly anti-business climate or sentiment, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to us and our customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income, sustained high rates of unemployment, high consumer debt levels, increasing fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters and acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism. Additionally, any of these circumstances concentrated in the region of the U.S. in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. General economic conditions and discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence in the economy;\n\u2022\nunemployment trends;\n\u2022\nconsumer debt levels;\n\u2022\nconsumer credit availability;\n\u2022\nthe housing and home improvement markets;\n\u2022\ngasoline and fuel prices;\n\u2022\ninterest rates and inflation;\n\u2022\nslower rates of growth in real disposable personal income;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nnational and international geopolitical concerns;\n\u2022\ntax rates and tax policy; and\n\u2022\nother matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.\nVolatility in financial markets may cause some of the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude. The above factors could result in slowdown in the economy or an uncertain economic outlook, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOther conditions that may impact our results of operations include disruptions in the availability of content such as sporting events or other televised content. Such disruptions may influence the demand for hardware that our customers purchase to access such content, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is traded publicly and various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts\u2019 estimates of our future performance. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own independent opinions and can be different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nDisruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise, including our third-paty delivery services, could adversely impact our business.\nAny disruption in the operation of our distribution centers could result in our inability to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales; increased costs; damage to our reputation; inability to stock our stores; or longer lead time associated with distributing merchandise. Any such disruption within our supply chain network, including damage or destruction to one of our five regional distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade restrictions; tariffs; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; or other factors beyond our control could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\nIn addition, our deliveries are outsourced to third-party delivery providers. Our third-party delivery services are subject to risks that are beyond our control. If our products are not delivered to our customers on time, our customers may cancel their orders or we may lose business from these customers in the future. As a result, our net sales and profitability may decline.\nWe are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur statutory, regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:\n\u2022\nThe difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, state and national jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nThe impact of proposed, new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, corporate governance matters, environmental, financial reform, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, health care reform, labor reform, Payment Card Industry compliance and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;\n\u2022\nThe impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards;\n\u2022\nThe impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and stockholders, and labor and employment matters; and\n\u2022\nChanges in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, economic or political instability, natural disasters, public health emergencies and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages of these items, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods, or may force us to increase prices, thereby adversely impacting net sales and profitability.\nAdapting to regulatory changes and defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders affiliated with our directors own a large percentage of our voting common stock and could limit the influence of our other stockholders on corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors, current holders of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 49.0% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, any person who acquires shares of our common stock will likely have little or no ability to influence control of the Company. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders, and they may act in a manner with which our other stockholders may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nWe have anti-takeover defense provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may deter potential acquirers and depress the price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and determine the powers, preferences and privileges of those shares without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimit the calling of special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nimpose a requirement that an affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to amend certain provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on action by written consent of shareholders as required by the Indiana Business Corporation Law, or the IBCL; and\n\u2022\nthe application of the Business Combination provisions of the IBCL.\nBecause of these various provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, a takeover attempt or third-party acquisition of us, including a takeover attempt that may result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock, could be delayed, deterred or prevented. In addition, these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from increasing in response to actual or rumored takeover attempts and may also prevent changes in our management. As a result, these anti-takeover and change of control provisions may limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92177, "SIC": 5731, "TIC": "HGGGQ"}
