RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business.\nThe depressed conditions in our industry have materially and adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition during 2015 and, unless conditions in our industry improve, this trend will continue during 2016 and potentially beyond.\nOil and natural gas prices began a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions persisted and worsened during 2015 and that trend has continued into 2016. As a result, demand for our products and services has declined substantially, and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. These trends materially and adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition during 2015 and, unless conditions in our industry improve, this trend will continue during 2016 and potentially beyond.\nWe had substantial net losses during 2014 and 2015, and, during 2015, our cash flow used by operations was $22.4 million. If industry conditions do not improve, we may continue to suffer net losses and negative cash flows from operations.\nAlthough we pursued a number of initiatives during 2015 to improve our liquidity and financial position and are continuing to pursue other initiatives, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate these initiatives or that they will be successful to improve our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business is cyclical and depends on conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, especially oil and natural gas prices and capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies. A continuation of the depressed state of our industry, tight credit markets and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies and financial systems may adversely impact our business.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been volatile as a result of changes in the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and other factors. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 caused many of our customers to significantly reduce drilling, completion and other production activities and related spending on our products and services in 2015. Many exploration and production companies have already announced plans to further reduce spending and activity levels in 2016; thus, we expect this trend to continue and potentially worsen in 2016 and potentially beyond. In addition, the reduction in demand from our customers has resulted in an oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, and such oversupply has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for our services.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas. Therefore, weakness in oil and natural gas prices (or the perception by our customers that oil and natural gas prices will remain reduced or will continue to decrease in the future) has and may continue to result in a reduction in the utilization of our equipment and in lower rates for our services. In addition to adversely affecting us, the continuation and worsening of these conditions have resulted and may continue to result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers\u2019 liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in payment of, or non-payment of, amounts owing to us and similar impacts. These conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows, and it is difficult to predict how long the current depressed commodity price environment will continue.\nMany factors affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, influence product prices, including:\n\u2022\nprices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas including the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production capacity, available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulation of exploration and drilling activities and equipment, material or supplies that we furnish;\n\u2022\npublic pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area and severe winter weather that can interfere with our operations;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel and energy sources;\n\u2022\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major global currencies.\nSpending by exploration and production companies has also been, and may continue to be, impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, and higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures have contributed to exploration and production companies making materially significant reductions to capital budgets and such limitations may continue if oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or decrease further. Such cuts in spending have curtailed, and may continue to curtail, drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, and a decrease in the development rate of reserves in our market areas whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nA substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices generally leads to decreased spending by our customers. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe amount of our debt and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $964.9 million of total debt. Our level of indebtedness, and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting management's flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndiminishing our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in our business or the economy generally;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nmaking us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because certain of our debt has variable interest rates.\nAs more fully described in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources, each of our ABL Facility, our Term Loan Facility and our Indenture contain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial ratios and tests, with which we must comply. These covenants include, among others, covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions without the permission of the holders of our indebtedness, including the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets, and the financial ratios and tests include, among others, a requirement that we comply with a minimum liquidity covenant, an asset coverage ratio and, during certain periods, a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, under our Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility, we are required to take certain steps to perfect the security interest in the Term Priority Collateral within specified periods following the closing of those facilities.\nOur ability to satisfy required financial covenants, ratios and tests in our debt agreements can be affected by events beyond our control, including commodity prices, demand for our services, the valuation of our assets, costs incurred in connection with resolving our FCPA investigation as well as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with such covenants or that the holders of our indebtedness will not seek to assert that we are not in compliance with our covenants. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios or tests could result in a default under our indebtedness. If we default, lenders under our ABL Facility will no longer be obligated to extend credit to us and they, as well as the trustee for our outstanding notes and the administrative agent under our Term Loan Facility, could declare all amounts of outstanding debt together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The results of such actions would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and absent strategic alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or capital structure, we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness. If such a result were to occur, we may be forced into bankruptcy or forced to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure our business and capital structure and may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements.\nWe may incur more debt and long-term lease obligations in the future.\nThe agreements governing our long-term debt restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness and other obligations in the future. As of December 31, 2015, we had $964.9 million of total debt.\nAn increase in our level of indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor and the occurrence of any of such events could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and business prospects.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other costs of our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a large extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, including commodity prices, demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge for our services, general economic and financial conditions, competition in the markets in which we operate, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. During fiscal year 2015, we had negative cash flows from operations, and this trend could continue if conditions in our industry continue or worsen.\nIn light of the ongoing depressed conditions in our industry and our financial condition, we continue to explore alternatives to improve our liquidity. We may not be able to implement any such a transaction or alternative, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and, even if we are successful in implementing a strategic transaction or alternative, such transaction or alternative may not be successful in allowing us to meet our debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt or other obligations, or to implement a strategic transaction or alternative, our creditors could potentially force us into bankruptcy or we could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure our business and capital structure, in which case we could be forced to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements. Even if we are able to implement a strategic transaction or alternative, such transaction or alternative may impose onerous terms on us. Additionally, we have a significant amount of secured indebtedness that is senior to our unsecured indebtedness and a significant amount of total indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, we believe that implementation of a strategic transaction or alternative or a bankruptcy proceeding could result in a limited recovery for unsecured noteholders, if any, and place equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their interests in our company.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our ABL Facility bear interest at variable rates, exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nOur bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or delay a change in control.\nOur bylaws contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to respond to unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, providing for three-year staggered terms of office for all members of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nset limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the board occurring between stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nset limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions may have the effect of entrenching management and may deprive investors of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers seeking control of the Company at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to implement price increases or maintain existing prices on our core services.\nWe periodically seek to increase the prices of our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders. Currently, the prices we are able to charge for our services and the demand for such services are severely depressed. Even when industry conditions are favorable, we operate in a very competitive industry and as a result, we are not always successful in raising, or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity, including new well service rigs, fluid hauling trucks, coiled tubing units and new fishing and rental equipment, may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase or maintain prices. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our profitability.\nEven when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices for our services. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our prices or to increase our prices as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry. We may not be able to finance future growth of our operations or future acquisitions.\nOur activities require substantial capital expenditures. If our cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our ABL Facility (as defined below) are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we would be required to reduce these expenditures or fund these expenditures through debt or equity or alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt or selling assets.\nOur ability to raise debt or equity capital or to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. We currently have very little ability to raise new capital or refinance our indebtedness due to our financial condition and covenants in our debt instruments and, as a result, we have undertaken efforts to curtail our spending, which may limit our ability to grow our business and our ability to sustain or improve our profits may be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIncreased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers could hurt our operations.\nCompanies in our industry, including us, are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide our customers with the highest quality service. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, and which can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. Labor costs may increase in the future or we may not be able to reduce wages when demand and pricing falls, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges in the past. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill for impairment. In performing these assessments, we project future cash flows on a discounted basis for goodwill, and on an undiscounted basis for other long-lived assets, and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets. These cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans, estimates and judgmental assumptions. We perform the assessment of potential impairment on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more often if events and circumstances warrant. We perform the assessment of potential impairment for our property and equipment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors. During 2015, we recorded $722.1 million in impairment charges, and if conditions in our industry do not improve or worsen, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur business involves certain operating risks, which are primarily self-insured, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured losses or liabilities we might incur in our operations.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards and risks, including the following:\n\u2022\naccidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property;\n\u2022\nliabilities from accidents or damage by our fleet of trucks, rigs and other equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other damage to the environment;\n\u2022\nreservoir damage;\n\u2022\nblow-outs, the uncontrolled flow of natural gas, oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere or an underground formation; and\n\u2022\nfires and explosions.\nIf any of these hazards occur, they could result in suspension of operations, damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others, or injury or death to our or a third party's personnel.\nWe self-insure against a significant portion of these liabilities. For losses in excess of our self-insurance limits, we maintain insurance from unaffiliated commercial carriers. However, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations. Furthermore, our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the hazards of our business. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance\npolicies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. We also are subject to the risk that we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition, which may intensify as our competitors expand their operations.\nThe market for oilfield services in which we operate is highly competitive and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial resources than we do. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers.\nThe principal competitive factors in our markets are product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for safety and price. The competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers. The fact that drilling rigs and other vehicles and oilfield services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry. We may be competing for work against competitors that may be better able to withstand industry downturns and may be better suited to compete on the basis of price, retain skilled personnel and acquire new equipment and technologies, all of which could affect our revenues and profitability.\nCompliance with new regulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nIn accordance with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) the SEC new disclosure requirements, which became effective in 2014, for manufacturers of products containing certain minerals which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Manufacturers are also required to disclose their efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from them. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries manufactures certain products that are covered by these requirements. The implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the metals used in the manufacture of our products. The regulations may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain the metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Finally, some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that the metals used in our products are free of conflict minerals.\nWe are subject to the economic, political and social instability risks of doing business in certain foreign countries.\nWe currently have operations based in Mexico and Russia and we own a technology development and control systems business based in Canada. As a result, we are exposed to risks of international operations, including:\n\u2022\nincreased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\ninflation and adverse economic conditions stemming from governmental attempts to reduce inflation, such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls;\n\u2022\neconomic and financial instability of national oil companies;\n\u2022\nincreased trade barriers, such as higher tariffs and taxes on imports of commodity products;\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nexchange controls or other currency restrictions;\n\u2022\nwar, civil unrest or significant political instability;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of income or capital;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, nationalization or other government actions with respect to our assets located in the markets where we operate;\n\u2022\ngovernmental policies limiting investments by and returns to foreign investors;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest and strikes;\n\u2022\ndeprivation of contract rights; and\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental regulation and bureaucratic delays.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these risks may:\n\u2022\nnegatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022\nrestrict the movement of funds and equipment to and from affected countries; and\n\u2022\ninhibit our ability to collect receivables.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Geostream, provides drilling, workover and reservoir engineering services in Russia. Continued political instability, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, economic sanctions and actual or threatened military action related to the annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea could have a material adverse effect on our subsidiary\u2019s operations in the region and on the result of operations of our International segment.\nIf there is a failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar laws, it could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA and similar laws is dependent on the success of our compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents, affiliates and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. Our compliance program is also dependent on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our Business Code of Conduct. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of violation of the FCPA or similar laws by us or any of our employees.\nThe current inquiries into issues related to compliance with the FCPA and similar laws may have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nIn January 2014, the SEC advised Key that it is investigating possible violations involving business activities of Key's operations in Russia. In April 2014, we became aware of an allegation involving our Mexico operations that, if true, could potentially constitute a violation of certain of our policies, including our Code of Business Conduct, the FCPA and other applicable laws. In 2014 and 2015, a Special Committee of the Board of Directors concluded an independent investigation into these matters, as well as a review of certain aspects of the Company\u2019s operations and a risk assessment with regard to our other international locations. The Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) is also conducting investigations of these matters, and we are cooperating with both the SEC and DOJ investigations. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a more detailed discussion of these investigations.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, legal and other expenses in connection with the Special Committee and government investigations and related compliance activities. In addition, our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current and potential clients in the relevant foreign jurisdictions could be adversely affected by the outcome of, or publicity relating to, the investigations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced a high employee turnover rate. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding workers could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that the high turnover rate in our industry is attributable to the nature of oilfield services work, which is physically demanding and performed outdoors. As a result, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. The potential inability or lack of desire by workers to commute to our facilities and job sites, as well as the competition for workers from competitors or other industries, are factors that could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain workers. We may not be able to recruit, train and retain an adequate number of workers to replace departing workers. The inability to maintain an adequate workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and maintaining technology development and enhancements. New technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to implement new technologies before we can. If we are unable to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis and at competitive cost, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nA component of our business strategy is to incorporate the KeyView\u00ae system, our proprietary technology, into our well service rigs. The inability to successfully develop, integrate and protect this technology could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to improve our market position;\n\u2022\nincrease our operating costs; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to recoup the investments made in this technological initiative.\nThe loss of or a substantial reduction in activity by one or more of our largest customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our ten largest customers represented approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues for the period. The loss of or a substantial reduction in activity by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential adoption of future state or federal laws or regulations surrounding the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil or natural gas wells and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our customers utilize hydraulic fracturing services during the life of a well. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in underground formations where water, sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into the formation. Although we are not a provider of hydraulic fracturing services, many of our services complement the hydraulic fracturing process.\nLegislation has been introduced in Congress to provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing operations and the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process. Additionally, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and in May 2012 issued draft guidance for fracturing operations that involved diesel fuels. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed through the adoption of new laws and regulations, our customers' business and operations could be subject to delays and increased operating and compliance costs, which could negatively impact the number of active wells in the marketplaces we serve. New regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing and chemical disclosure have been approved or are under consideration by a number of states and some municipalities have sought to restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions. The adoption of future federal, state or municipal laws regulating the hydraulic fracturing process could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern our operations.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, storage and disposal of waste materials, including toxic and hazardous wastes. To comply with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental authorities. While the cost of such compliance has not been significant in the past, new laws, regulations or enforcement policies could become more stringent and significantly increase our compliance costs or limit our future business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations pose risks of environmental liability, including leakage from our operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability, or both. Therefore, in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Actions arising under these laws and regulations could result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures, and claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations also may include the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, revocation of permits, temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities could significantly delay or interrupt our operations. Increasing regulatory expansion could adversely impact costs associated with our offshore Fishing and Rental Services.\nThe scope of regulation of our services may increase in light of the April 2010 Macondo accident and resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, including possible increases in liabilities or funding requirements imposed by governmental agencies. In 2012, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or \u201cBSEE\u201d, expanded its regulatory oversight beyond oil and gas operators to include service and equipment contractors. In addition, U.S. federal law imposes on certain entities deemed to be \u201cresponsible parties\u201d a variety of regulations related to the prevention of oil spills, releases of hazardous substances, and liability for removal costs and natural resource, real property and certain economic damages arising from such incidents. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for certain costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As a provider of services and rental equipment for offshore drilling and workover services, we may be deemed a \u201cresponsible party\u201d under federal law. The implementation of such laws and the adoption and implementation of future\nregulatory initiatives, or the specific responsibilities that may arise from such initiatives may subject us to increased costs and liabilities, which could interrupt our operations or have an adverse effect on our revenue or results of operations.\nSevere weather could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather. Our customers' oil and natural gas operations located in Louisiana and parts of Texas may be adversely affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, resulting in reduced demand for our services. Furthermore, our customers' operations may be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. Adverse weather can also directly impede our own operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of services;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u2022\nloss of productivity.\nThese constraints could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Unusually warm winters may also adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas.\nAcquisitions and divestitures - we may not be successful in identifying, making and integrating acquisitions or limiting ongoing costs associated with the operations we divest.\nAn important component of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions that will strengthen our core services or presence in selected markets. The success of this strategy will depend, among other things, on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable financial and other terms, to timely and successfully integrate acquired business or assets into our existing businesses and to retain the key personnel and the customer base of acquired businesses. Any future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain or attract key employees;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from existing operations or other priorities;\n\u2022\nthe inability to implement promptly an effective control environment;\n\u2022\npotential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline;\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which the company has limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022\ninability to secure sufficient financing, sufficient financing on economically attractive terms, that may be required for any such acquisition or investment.\nOur business plan anticipates, and is based upon our ability to successfully complete and integrate, acquisitions of other businesses or assets in a timely and cost effective manner. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees, service level agreements, or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results if there is contingent consideration associated.\nCompliance with climate change legislation or initiatives could negatively impact our business.\nVarious state governments and regional organizations comprising state governments are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases, or \u201cGHG\u201d, from stationary sources, which may include our equipment and operations. At the federal level, the EPA has already issued regulations that require us to establish and report an inventory of GHG emissions. The EPA also has established a GHG permitting requirement for large stationary sources and may lower the threshold of the permitting program, which could include our equipment and operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting GHG emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for natural gas and oil. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Management cannot predict the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products, and any major changes may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has received a notice of failure to comply with the NYSE continued listing standard related to the minimum trading price of its common stock. If the Company is unable to avoid the delisting of its common stock from the NYSE, it could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOn September 2, 2015, Key Energy Services, Inc. was notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) that it is not in compliance with the continued listing standards set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock was less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.\nUnder the NYSE Listed Company Manual, a listed company is generally afforded a six-month period following receipt of the NYSE deficiency notice to regain compliance, after which the NYSE will commence suspension of trading and delisting procedures. However, if the Company\u2019s plan to cure the stock price deficiency requires stockholder approval, the Company can avoid delisting procedures as long as it obtains stockholder approval of the reverse stock split at its next annual meeting and promptly implements the reverse stock split following the meeting. Regaining compliance requires, on the last trading day of any calendar month, a company\u2019s common stock price per share and 30 trading-day average closing share price to be at least $1.00. During this six month period, and if necessary, any additional period in order to obtain stockholder approval at the Company\u2019s next annual meeting, a company\u2019s common stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE, subject to compliance with other continued listing requirements and further subject to the discretion of the NYSE to commence delisting procedures against a company\u2019s common stock for other reasons, such as selling for an abnormally low price. Although the Company intends to submit the reverse stock split to its stockholders at the next annual meeting in order to cure the stock price deficiency and return to compliance with the NYSE continued listing requirement, the Company can provide no assurance that this measure will be successful.\nIn addition, the Company's common stock could be delisted pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual if the trading price of the Company's stock is deemed by the NYSE to be \u201cabnormally low.\u201d In this event, the Company would not have an opportunity to cure the stock price deficiency, and the Company's shares would be immediately suspended from trading on the NYSE. While there is no formal definition of \u201cabnormally low\u201d in the NYSE rules, we understand that the NYSE has recently delisted the common stock of issuers when it trades below $0.16 per share. The Company\u2019s common stock has recently traded as low as $0.17 per share and we can offer no assurance that continued trading of the Company\u2019s common stock at this level or a lower level would not be deemed \u201cabnormally low\u201d by the NYSE, which would result in immediate suspension and subsequent delisting. In addition, the NYSE will promptly initiate suspension and delisting procedures if the NYSE determines that we have an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of less than $15.0 million.\nIf the Company\u2019s common stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, it could negatively impact the Company by, among other things, (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of the Company\u2019s common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire the Company\u2019s common stock, which could further harm the performance of the Company\u2019s common stock and negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limiting the Company\u2019s ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing the Company from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing the Company\u2019s ability to provide equity incentives to its employees.", "PERMNO": 63079, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "KEGX"}
