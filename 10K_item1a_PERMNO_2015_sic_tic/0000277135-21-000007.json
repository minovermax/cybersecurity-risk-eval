{"cik": "277135", "company": "W.W. GRAINGER, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to Grainger\u2019s business that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which the Company is exposed.\nGrainger\u2019s business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the global outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and may be adversely affected by other global outbreaks of pandemic disease.\nAny global outbreaks of pandemic disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on Grainger\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity, capital and financing resources.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and adversely affected Grainger\u2019s business, including its business with customers and suppliers. Grainger has experienced customer disruptions to their ability or willingness to purchase Grainger products, customer delays in making purchasing decisions, shifts in the types and quantities of products purchased and, in some cases, diminished customer loyalty and retention rates. These may continue to persist during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Grainger has also experienced and may continue to experience supplier disruptions to their supply chains, supplier inability to manufacture or sell products to Grainger or meet the unprecedented demand for pandemic-related products, rapid shifts in the type, quantity or quality of products sold, and higher product costs. Additional effects on Grainger's business include disruptions or closures of customer and supplier facilities, and their ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, Grainger's ability to collect its accounts receivable or receive product ordered from suppliers, as customers and suppliers face higher liquidity and solvency risks and seek terms that are less favorable to Grainger, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. These developments, alone or in combination, could materially adversely affect Grainger\u2019s future sales and results of operations.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Grainger also include restrictions on Grainger\u2019s employees\u2019 ability to visit customers and many of Grainger\u2019s employees\u2019 ability to work in offices or at facilities, as well as disruptions or temporary closures of the Company\u2019s facilities, including distribution centers, branches, and support buildings. Some actions that Grainger has taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including enabling remote working arrangements, may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage Grainger\u2019s reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues, and expose Grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card association, employees and others. In addition, Grainger\u2019s remote working arrangements have required the Company to make adaptions to its controls and procedures, including to its financial reporting processes, that could impact the design or operating effectiveness of such controls or procedures.\nFurthermore, as result of surges in demand and disruptions in supply chains, including in China and other locations, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in shortages of certain PPE, cleaning supplies and other products, which may materially impact Grainger's ability to obtain or deliver inventory to customers on a timely basis or at all. While Grainger attempts to maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet quickly shifting customer demand patterns and supplier lead time requirements, which may become extended due to the pandemic demand increase, the Company cannot be certain it will be able to accurately predict demand or lead times, which might cause it to be unable to service customer demand or expose it to risks of product shortages, or acquire excess inventory, which could lead to additional inventory carrying costs and inventory obsolescence.\nPandemic product shortages may also require the Company to attempt to procure products from new suppliers or through brokers with whom it has a limited or no prior relationship. Despite due diligence and product compliance protocols, the products from these sources may not be delivered on a timely basis or at all, or their quality may not be as represented, all of which could cause Grainger to incur costs, including the expense of procuring alternate products or recalling or replacing products in addition to other adverse impacts to Grainger\u2019s business.\nMoreover, global outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the economies of many countries, resulting in a global or regional economic downturn or recession. Any such recession could result in a significant decline in demand for the\nCompany\u2019s products or limit Grainger\u2019s ability to access capital markets on terms that are attractive or at all, any of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe duration and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity, capital and financing resources, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Such factors and developments may include the geographic spread, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether there are periods of increased COVID-19 cases, disruption to Grainger\u2019s operations resulting from employee illnesses, the development, availability and administration of effective treatment or vaccines, the extent and duration of the impact on the U.S. or global economy, including the pace and extent of recovery when the pandemic subsides, and the actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak, including current and future health and safety measures, such as mandatory facility closures of non-essential businesses, stay in shelter health orders or similar restrictions, social distancing mandates and travel bans, import and export restrictions, pricing mandates, including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes, and mandatory directives that certain products be allocated or provided to certain customers, which could disrupt the Company\u2019s relationship with customers, among other actions. If the Company is unable to respond to and manage the impact of these events, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected.\nWeakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Grainger\u2019s customers could negatively impact Grainger\u2019s sales growth and results of operations.\nEconomic, political and industry trends affect Grainger\u2019s business environments. Grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of Grainger\u2019s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, central bank interest rate changes, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, inflation, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Grainger\u2019s control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.\nAny of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Grainger or impair the ability of Grainger\u2019s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on Grainger\u2019s selling prices and terms of sale. Accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, the U.K., the U.S. or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact Grainger\u2019s sales growth and results of operations.\nThe facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for Grainger\u2019s products and services.\nGrainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience, and the overall experience Grainger offers. This includes the ease of use of Grainger\u2019s high-touch operations (branches and digital platforms) and delivery of products.\nThere are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency.\nTo remain competitive, the Company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. Downward pressure on sales prices, changes in the volume of orders, and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause Grainger\u2019s gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline. Grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. These pressures could have a material effect on Grainger\u2019s sales and profitability. If the Company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, Grainger expects technological advancements and the increased use of eCommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, Grainger\u2019s ability to effectively compete requires Grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments. Implementing new technology and innovations may result in unexpected costs and interruptions to operations, may take longer than expected, and may not provide all anticipated benefits.\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.\nSome of Grainger\u2019s products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, rare earth minerals, or other materials or inputs required to manufacture PPE and other pandemic-related products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market. The price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility, which among other things, could be driven by economic, monetary, political or weather-related factors. Fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services, including as a result of outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect transportation costs. Grainger\u2019s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could reduce demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes.\nUnexpected product shortages, tariffs, product cost increases and risks associated with Grainger\u2019s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger\u2019s competitive strengths include product selection and availability. Products are purchased from more than 4,500 suppliers located in various countries around the world, not one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases.\nWhile Grainger has not generally encountered significant difficulty in procuring sources of supply, disruptions could occur due to factors beyond Grainger\u2019s control. These factors could include economic downturns, outbreaks of pandemic disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic (which from time to time has resulted in some shortages of PPE, cleaning supplies and other products), natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical unrest, tariffs, new tariffs or tariff increases, trade issues and policies, detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products, labor problems experienced by Grainger\u2019s suppliers, transportation availability and cost, shortage of raw materials, unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier\u2019s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in Grainger\u2019s product costs.\nFurther, Grainger sources products from Asia and other areas of the world. This increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required and distances involved.\nIf Grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products, there could be a short-term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer-term adverse effect on customer relationships and Grainger\u2019s reputation. In addition, Grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event Grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.\nChanges in customer base or product mix could cause changes in Grainger\u2019s revenue or gross margin, or affect Grainger\u2019s competitive position.\nFrom time to time, Grainger experiences changes in customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, competition and the increased use of eCommerce by Grainger and its competitors. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has sold higher volumes of lower-margin pandemic-related products to larger, lower-margin customers, while non-pandemic sales have decreased.\nIn addition, Grainger has entered, and may in the future continue to enter, into contracts with group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d) that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices. If the Company is unable to enter into, or sustain, contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with GPOs, Grainger's results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs customer base and product mix change over time, Grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. The inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into Grainger\u2019s existing mix could have a negative impact on future sales growth and Grainger\u2019s competitive position.\nDisruptions in Grainger\u2019s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural or human induced disasters, including earthquakes, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather; pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the COVID-19 pandemic; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which Grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of Grainger\u2019s logistics or supply chain network. For example, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the operations of the Company and its suppliers and customers. Any such disruption or other catastrophic event could cause one or more of Grainger\u2019s distribution centers or branches to become non-operational, adversely affect Grainger\u2019s ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair Grainger\u2019s ability to meet customer demand for products, result in lost sales, additional costs, or penalties, or damage Grainger\u2019s reputation. Grainger\u2019s ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of Grainger\u2019s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.\nThe proper functioning of Grainger\u2019s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business. Grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems. Although Grainger\u2019s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, power losses, telecommunication failures, user error, third party actions such as malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and cybersecurity breaches, and other problems. In addition, from time to time Grainger relies on the information technology (IT) systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business.\nIf Grainger\u2019s systems or those of third parties on which Grainger depends are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, Grainger may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interruptions in its business operations in the interim. If critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, Grainger\u2019s ability to operate its eCommerce platforms, process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, disburse funds, manage its supply chain, monitor results of operations, and process and store employee or customer data, among other functions, could be adversely affected. Any such interruption of Grainger\u2019s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, could damage Grainger\u2019s reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.\nThrough Grainger\u2019s sales and eCommerce channels, Grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary and other information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on Grainger\u2019s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the Company. Moreover, Grainger\u2019s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers and employees, and other sensitive matters.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in the Company\u2019s information systems. If successful, these attacks may expose Grainger to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of business operations.\nGrainger's IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by suppliers, vendors and other third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of systems and proprietary or confidential information. Moreover, from time to time, Grainger may share information with these third parties in connection with the products and services they provide to the business. While Grainger requires assurances that these third parties will protect confidential information, there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised. If successful, those attempting to penetrate Grainger\u2019s or\nits vendors\u2019 information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable, credit card, confidential, proprietary or other sensitive customer, supplier, employee or business information, or cause systems disruption. While many of Grainger's agreements with these third parties include indemnification provisions, the Company may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses it may incur.\nMoreover, the Company may face the threat to its computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. Such tactics may also seek to cause payments due to or from the Company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts, which may not be recoverable by the Company.\nIn addition, a Grainger employee, contractor or other third party with whom Grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Further, Grainger\u2019s systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases, and a breach of the Company\u2019s information systems could be used to gain illicit access to a customer\u2019s systems and information.\nGrainger maintains information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to its information security systems, conducts employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilizes consultants to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of the security of its IT systems. While Grainger has instituted these and other safeguards for the protection of information, because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, Grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any breach of Grainger\u2019s security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of its third party service providers could cause Grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers, suppliers, employees, and other parties whose personal data is compromised and to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues. In addition, although Grainger maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nGrainger continuously evaluates the need to upgrade and/or replace its systems and network infrastructure to protect its computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of its systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and IT could adversely impact its operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, the Company's systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other IT disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on its business.\nLoss of customer, supplier, employee or intellectual property or other business information or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could disrupt operations, damage Grainger\u2019s reputation and expose Grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Grainger, its financial condition and results of operations. In the past, Grainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents. In each instance, Grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures. While these incidents have not been deemed to be material to Grainger, there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to Grainger\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nGrainger\u2019s ability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations.\nGrainger\u2019s business relies on the use, validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which includes current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of Grainger\u2019s intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect Grainger\u2019s rights. In addition, Grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject Grainger to liability, require Grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause Grainger to modify its operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations.\nGrainger\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements), as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity\u2019s functional currency. While the Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of Grainger\u2019s subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, Grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of Grainger\u2019s international subsidiaries, primarily the Canadian dollar, euro, pound sterling, Mexican peso, renminbi and yen, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. Grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary\u2019s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. These fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect Grainger\u2019s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.\nIn order to compete, Grainger must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nIn order to compete and have continued growth, Grainger must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and IT support positions. Grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. The Company's employee hiring and retention also depend on its ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables its employees to thrive.\nGrainger\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for diverse talent, higher employee turnover, increased employee benefit costs, failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees. Further, changes in the Company's management team may be disruptive to its business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nGrainger\u2019s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Grainger\u2019s reputation.\nOne of the reasons customers choose to do business with Grainger and employees choose Grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that Grainger has built over many years. Grainger devotes time and resources to environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts that are consistent with its corporate values and are designed to strengthen its business and protect and preserve its reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity, equity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. Grainger\u2019s failure to execute its ESG programs as planned could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business and financial performance. To be successful in the future, Grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Grainger\u2019s brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger\u2019s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger\u2019s business.\nGrainger is subject to various domestic and foreign laws, regulations and standards. Failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect Grainger\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGrainger\u2019s business is subject to legislative, legal, and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates. In addition to Grainger\u2019s U.S. operations, which in 2020 generated approximately 78% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, China, Mexico, and the U.K., and its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan.\nThe wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates, include, but are not limited to: advertising and marketing regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, anti-competition regulations, data protection (including, because Grainger accepts credit cards, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), environmental protection laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, health and safety laws, import and export requirements, intellectual property laws, labor laws (including federal and state wage and hour laws), product compliance or safety laws, supplier regulations\nregarding the sources of supplies or products, tax laws (including as to U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), unclaimed property laws and laws, regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters. Moreover, Grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary fines, penalties and/or, remediation costs as well as potential damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. Changes in these laws, regulations and standards, or in their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business, including, among other factors, as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes. Furthermore, while Grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, suppliers, vendors, or other third parties will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or Grainger\u2019s policies. Any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect Grainger\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, Grainger\u2019s business and results of operations in the U.K. may be negatively affected by changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws, resulting from the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nGrainger is subject to a number of rules and regulations related to its government contracts, which may result in increased compliance costs and potential liabilities.\nGrainger\u2019s contracts with U.S. federal, state and local government entities are subject to various and changing regulations related to procurement, formation and performance. In addition, the Company\u2019s government contracts may provide for termination, reduction or modification by the government at any time, with or without cause. From time to time, Grainger is subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits related to its compliance with these rules and regulations. Violations of these regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, the inability to participate in existing or future government contracting and other administrative sanctions. Any such penalties could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, increased costs of compliance and/or remediation and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn conducting its business Grainger may become subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations, including in connection with product liability or product compliance claims if people, property or the environment are harmed by Grainger\u2019s products or services.\nGrainger is, and from time to time may become, party to a number of legal proceedings or governmental investigations for alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations. Grainger also may be subject to disputes and proceedings incidental to its business, including product-related claims for personal injury or illness, death, environmental or property damage or other commercial disputes, including the proceedings discussed in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The defense of these proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management\u2019s time and attention, and Grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that Grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. Grainger also may be requested or required to recall products or take other actions. The Company\u2019s reputation could also be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.\nTax changes could affect Grainger\u2019s effective tax rate and future profitability.\nGrainger\u2019s future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in Grainger\u2019s overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of the Company\u2019s tax exposures.\nGrainger\u2019s common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.\nThe trading prices and volumes of Grainger\u2019s common stock may be subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuations due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the financial results and business strategies of Grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to Grainger\u2019s future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, the Company\u2019s failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements provided to the public, speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or investment community or by groups of individual investors, changes in capital structure, share repurchase programs or dividend policies, outbreak of pandemic disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and a number of\nother factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A. These factors, many of which are outside of Grainger\u2019s control, could cause stock price and trading volume volatility or Grainger\u2019s stock price to decline. Volatility in the price of Grainger's securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\nChanges in Grainger\u2019s credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.\nGrainger\u2019s credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s financial strength and factors outside of Grainger\u2019s control, such as conditions affecting Grainger\u2019s industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. Grainger cannot provide assurances that its current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of Grainger\u2019s securities may be adversely affected. In addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital on favorable terms, impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for the Company\u2019s existing credit facilities or on future financings.\nGrainger has incurred substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect cash flow, decrease business flexibility, or prevent Grainger from fulfilling its obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Grainger\u2019s consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.6 billion. The Company\u2019s indebtedness could, among other things, limit Grainger\u2019s ability to respond to rapidly changing business and economic conditions, require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, and make it more difficult to satisfy the Company\u2019s financial obligations as they come due during periods of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe agreements governing Grainger\u2019s debt agreements and instruments contain representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and default provisions. Grainger\u2019s failure to comply with these restrictions and obligations could result in a default under such agreements, which may allow Grainger\u2019s creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on Grainger\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future.\nIn addition, Grainger may in the future seek to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing of indebtedness, share repurchases or other general corporate purposes.
