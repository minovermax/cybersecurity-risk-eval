RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the material risks described below, which we believe represent the material risks related to our business and our securities, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our securities. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. In connection with such forward looking statements, you should also carefully review the cautionary statements referred to under \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\u2022The cyclical and volatile nature of the seaborne drybulk transportation industry may lead to significant decreases in charter and freight rates, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and profitability and our ability to comply with our loan covenants.\n\u2022Our financial results and operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, and related governmental responses thereto.\n\u2022An increase in interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\n\u2022Any change in drybulk carrier capacity in the future may result in lower charter and freight rates which, in turn, will adversely affect our profitability.\n\u2022The market values of our owned vessels may decrease, which could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow or cause us to breach certain covenants in our credit facilities and we may incur impairment or a loss if we sell vessels following a decline in their market value.\n\u2022The Company has relied on financial support from its founders and investors through related party loans, which may not be available to us in the future.\n\u2022The state of the global financial markets and economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact our business.\n\u2022Changes in the economic and political environment in China and policies adopted by the government to regulate its economy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect our operating results and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.\n\u2022If our vessels call on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S., the European Union, the United Nations, or other governmental authorities, it could lead to monetary fines or penalties and may adversely affect our reputation and the market for our securities.\n\u2022We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\n\u2022Changes in fuel prices, that may result from increased oil prices, may adversely affect our profitability.\n\u2022In the highly competitive international shipping industry, we may not be able to compete successfully for chartered-in vessels or for vessel employment and, as a result, we may be unable to charter-in vessels at reasonable rates or employ our vessels profitably.\n\u2022Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\n\u2022We depend upon a few significant customers for a large part of our revenues and cash flow, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u2022We are subject to certain risks with counterparties on contracts and the failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business and ability to comply with covenants in our loan agreements, which could impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\n\u2022Obligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention, and we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\n\u2022Because we purchase and operate secondhand vessels, we may be exposed to increased operating costs which could adversely affect our earnings and, as our fleet ages, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\n\u2022Our ability to obtain additional debt financing, or to refinance existing indebtedness, may be dependent on the performance and length of our charter contracts and the creditworthiness of our contract counterparties.\n\u2022We depend on our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other key employees, and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\n\u2022Exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will result in fluctuations in our cash flows and operating results.\n\u2022United States tax authorities could treat us as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d which could have adverse United States federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders.\n\u2022We have had and in the future may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements.\n\u2022We rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including on our vessels. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\n\u2022Volatility in the broader securities markets and trading volume of our common shares could adversely impact the trading price of our common shares.\n\u2022Because we are a foreign corporation, you may not have the same rights that a shareholder in a U.S. corporation may have, and it may not be possible for our investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Industry\nThe cyclical and volatile nature of the seaborne drybulk transportation industry may lead to decreases in charter and freight rates, which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings and profitability and its ability to comply with its loan covenants. The market showed signs of improvement beginning in late 2020 due to a continued decline in newbuilding deliveries which constrict the supply of tonnage and inflate rates and a rebound in demand from COVID 19 disruptions,. Going forward, rising protectionism and uncertainty concerning a trade war over tariffs may dampen growth in demand for some products, however, some analysts predict volumes will not change and may increase tonne-miles by disrupting historical trade patterns.\nThe seaborne drybulk transportation industry is cyclical and volatile, and a lengthy downturn in the drybulk charter market severely affected the entire drybulk shipping industry. Volatility of charter and freight rates is due to various factors, including changing crude oil prices, economic activity in the largest economies, including China, a strong U.S. Dollar and the associated weakening of other world currencies and the supply of available tonnage.\nAlthough our operating fleet is primarily chartered-in on a short-term basis and lower charter rates result in lower charter hire costs, changes in charter and freight rates in the drybulk market affect vessel values and earnings on our owned fleet, and may\naffect our cash flows, liquidity and ability to comply with the financial covenants in our loan agreements. Another extended downturn in the drybulk carrier market may have adverse consequences. The value of our common shares could be substantially reduced under these circumstances.\nWe employ our vessels under a mix of voyage charters and time charters and COA\u2019s which typically extend for varying lengths of time, from one month to ten years. As a result, we are exposed to changes in market rates for drybulk carriers and such changes may affect our earnings and the value of our owned drybulk carriers at any given time. A COA relates to the carriage of multiple cargoes over the same route and enables the COA holder to nominate different vessels to perform individual voyages. We may not be able to successfully employ our vessels in the future or renew existing contracts at rates sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations. We are also exposed to volatility in the market rates we pay to charter-in vessels. Fluctuations in charter and freight rates result from changes in the supply of and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the demand for seaborne carriage of commodities. Because the factors affecting the supply of and demand for vessels are outside of our control and are unpredictable, the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in industry conditions are also unpredictable.\nFactors that influence demand for vessel capacity include:\n\u2022supply of and demand for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;\n\u2022changes in the exploration or production of energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;\n\u2022the location of regional and global exploration, production and manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022the location of consuming regions for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;\n\u2022the globalization of production and manufacturing;\n\u2022global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities, embargoes and strikes;\n\u2022natural disasters and other disruptions in international trade;\n\u2022developments in international trade;\n\u2022changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including the distance cargo is transported by sea;\n\u2022environmental and other regulatory developments;\n\u2022currency exchange rates;\n\u2022pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022bunker (fuel) prices; and\n\u2022weather.\nDemand for our vessels is dependent upon economic growth in the world\u2019s economies, seasonal and regional changes in demand, changes in the capacity of the global drybulk fleet and the sources and supply of drybulk cargo transported by sea. Although the current newbuilding orderbook (as a percentage of the on-the-water fleet) is at a historically low level, a pickup in new ordering could increase global capacity and there can be no assurance that economic growth will continue in order to absorb this higher supply. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include:\n\u2022the number of newbuilding deliveries;\n\u2022port and canal congestion;\n\u2022bunker prices;\n\u2022the scrapping rate of older vessels;\n\u2022vessel casualties;\n\u2022speed of vessels being operated;\n\u2022the number of vessels that are out of service, namely those that are laid-up, dry-docked, awaiting repairs or otherwise not available for hire;\n\u2022availability of financing for new vessels;\n\u2022changes in national or international regulations that may effectively cause reductions in the carrying capacity of vessels or early obsolescence of tonnage; and\n\u2022changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful lives of vessels.\nIn addition to the prevailing and anticipated charter and freight rates, factors that affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel values in relation to scrap prices, costs of bunker fuels and other operating costs, costs associated with classification society surveys, normal maintenance and insurance coverage, the efficiency and age profile of the existing drybulk fleet in the market and government and industry regulation of maritime transportation practices, particularly environmental protection laws and regulations. These factors influencing the supply of and demand for shipping capacity are outside of our control, and we may not be able to correctly assess the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions.\nWe anticipate that the future demand for our drybulk carriers and our logistics services will be dependent upon economic growth in world economies and its associated industrial production, seasonal and regional changes in demand, changes in the capacity of the global drybulk carrier fleet and the sources and supply of drybulk cargoes to be transported by sea.\nGlobal economic conditions may continue to negatively impact the drybulk shipping industry.\nIn the current global economy, operating businesses are faced with tightening credit, weak demand for goods and services, and weak international liquidity conditions. There has similarly been a general decline in the willingness by banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry, due to the historically volatile asset values of vessels. As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it has been negatively affected by this decline. In particular, lower demand for drybulk cargoes as well as diminished trade credit available for the delivery of such cargoes have led to decreased demand for drybulk vessels, creating downward pressure on charter rates and vessel values. Any further weakening in global economic conditions may have a number of adverse consequences for drybulk and other shipping sectors, including, among other things:\n\u2022low charter rates, particularly for vessels employed on short-term time charters or in the spot market;\n\u2022decreases in the market value of drybulk vessels and limited second-hand market for the sale of vessels;\n\u2022limited financing for vessels;\n\u2022widespread loan covenant defaults; and\n\u2022declaration of bankruptcy by certain vessel operators, vessel owners, shipyards and charterers.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nWe are subject to market risks relating to changes in LIBOR rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding. Moreover, in the recent past, concerns have been publicized that some of the member banks surveyed by the British Bankers\u2019 Association (\u201cBBA\u201d) in connection with the calculation of LIBOR may have been underreporting or otherwise manipulating the inter-bank lending rate applicable to them. A number of BBA member banks entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged LIBOR manipulation, and investigations by regulators and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions are ongoing. In addition, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is not currently possible to predict the effect of any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. If LIBOR or any alternative reference rate were to increase significantly, the amount of interest payable on our outstanding indebtedness could increase significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.\nAny change in drybulk carrier capacity in the future may result in lower charter and freight rates which, in turn, will adversely affect our profitability.\nThe global drybulk fleet has increased significantly over the past 10 years as a result of the large number of newbuilding orders placed throughout this period. Scrapping of older ships has helped curtail some of this new supply growth, but it has not been\nenough to materially offset the large net growth in the fleet. Supply growth momentum has slowed down significantly in recent years as less and less newbuilding orders have been placed. During 2020, 432 newbuilding vessels were delivered to industry participants, and 96 vessels were scrapped, resulting in 4.3% net growth in the drybulk fleet on a DWT-adjusted basis.\nAlthough supply growth has been decreasing, the global fleet remains over-supplied. Assuming newbuilding ordering remains at current low levels, it may take some years until the excess supply ultimately gets absorbed by growing demand and natural attrition of the fleet as older vessels go to demolition.\nThe market values of our owned vessels may decrease, which could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow or cause us to breach certain covenants in our credit facilities and we may incur impairment or a loss if we sell vessels following a decline in their market value.\nThe fair market values of our owned vessels have generally experienced high volatility, and you should expect the market values of our vessels to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including:\n\u2022prevailing level of charter and freight rates;\n\u2022general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry;\n\u2022types and sizes of vessels;\n\u2022supply of and demand for vessels;\n\u2022other modes of transportation;\n\u2022cost of newbuildings;\n\u2022governmental and other regulations; and\n\u2022technological advances.\nIn addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. If the market values of our owned vessels decrease, we may not be in compliance with certain covenants in our credit facilities secured by mortgages on our drybulk vessels unless we provide additional collateral or prepay a portion of the loan to a level where we are again in compliance with our loan covenants. The Company was in compliance with all of its covenants for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIf we sell one or more of our vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen and before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our consolidated financial statements, the sale proceeds may be less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount, resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings.\nThe carrying amounts of vessels held and used by us are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular vessel may not be fully recoverable. In such instances, an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount. This assessment is made at the asset group level which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets. The asset groups are defined by vessel size and classification.\nThe Company has relied on financial support from its founders and investors through related party loans, which may not be available to the Company in the future.\nFrom time to time, we have obtained loans from our founders, Edward Coll, Anthony Laura, and Lagoa Investments, an entity beneficially owned by Claus Boggild, to meet vessel purchase, newbuilding deposit, and other obligations of the Company. These loans may not be available to the Company in the future. Even if we are able to borrow money from such parties, such borrowing could create a conflict of interest of management to the extent they also act as lenders to the Company.\nThe state of the global financial markets and economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nGlobal financial markets can be volatile and contraction in available credit may happen as economic conditions change. In recent years, operating businesses in the global economy have faced weakening demand for goods and services, deteriorating international liquidity conditions, and declining markets which lead to a general decline in the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry. As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it may be negatively affected by such changes and volatility.\nAlso, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase if lenders increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt, and reduce, or cease to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, additional financing may not be available to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to expand or meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nWorld events could affect our operations and financial results.\nPast terrorist attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks around the world, continue to cause uncertainty in the world\u2019s financial markets and may affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Continuing conflicts, instability and other recent developments in the Middle East and elsewhere, and the presence of U.S. or other armed forces in Afghanistan and Syria, may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks attendant to changes in economic and regulatory conditions around the world.\nWe face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, instability in the banking and securities markets and trade regulations around the world, among other factors. Major market disruptions and adverse changes in market conditions and regulatory climate in China, the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our business or impair our ability to borrow amounts under any future financial arrangements.\nFor example, the economic slowdown in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in China, could negatively affect global economic markets and the market for drybulk shipping. Chinese drybulk imports have accounted for the majority of global drybulk transportation growth annually over the last decade, with recent demand growth driven by stronger iron ore and coal imports into China. Before the global economic financial crisis that began in 2008, China had one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product, or GDP, which had a significant impact on shipping demand. The growth rate of China\u2019s GDP for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 2.3%, down from a growth rate of 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, but remaining well below pre-2008 levels. China and other countries in the Asia Pacific region may continue to experience slowed or even negative economic growth in the future. Our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our future prospects, would likely be hindered by a continuing or worsening economic downturn in any of these countries or geographic regions. Furthermore, there is a rising threat of a Chinese financial crisis resulting from massive personal and corporate indebtedness and \u201ctrade wars\u201d. The International Monetary Fund has warned that continuing trade tensions, including significant tariff increases, between the United States and China could derail recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. We cannot assure you that the Chinese economy will not experience a significant contraction in the future.\nThe United States, the European Union and other parts of the world have likewise experienced relatively slow growth and weak economic trends since 2008. Over the past several years, the credit markets in the United States and Europe have remained conditions have generally improved, renewed adverse and developing economic and governmental factors, together with the concurrent volatility in charter rates and vessel values, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could cause the price of our common shares to decline. An extended period of deterioration in the outlook for the world economy could reduce the overall demand for our services and could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nChanges in the economic and political environment in China and policies adopted by the government to regulate its economy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of western countries in such respects as structure, government involvement, level of development, growth rate, capital reinvestment, allocation of resources, bank regulation, currency and monetary policy, rate of inflation and balance of payments position. Prior to 1978, the Chinese economy was a \u201cplanned economy\u201d. Since 1978, increasing emphasis has been placed on the utilization of market forces in the development of the Chinese economy. Annual and five-year State Plans are adopted by the Chinese government in connection with the development of the economy. Although state-owned enterprises still account for a substantial portion of the Chinese industrial output, in general, the Chinese government is reducing the level of direct control that it exercises over the economy through State Plans and other measures. There is an increasing level of freedom and autonomy in areas such as allocation of resources, production, pricing and\nmanagement and a gradual shift in emphasis to a \u201cmarket economy\u201d and enterprise reform. Limited price reforms were undertaken with the result that prices for certain commodities are principally determined by market forces. In addition, economic reforms may include reforms to the banking and credit sector and may produce a shift away from the export-driven growth model that has characterized the Chinese economy over the past few decades. Many of the reforms are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision, change or abolition based upon the outcome of such experiments. The level of imports to and exports from China could be adversely affected by the failure to continue market reforms or changes to existing pro-export economic policies. The level of imports to and exports from China may also be adversely affected by changes in political, economic and social conditions (including a slowing of economic growth) or other relevant policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws, regulations or export and import restrictions, internal political instability, changes in currency policies, changes in trade policies and territorial or trade disputes. A decrease in the level of imports to and exports from China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, which may negatively impact our planned growth.\nAs a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the ability to obtain money from the credit markets has become more difficult as many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced, and in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that financing will be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nActs of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect our business.\nActs of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean and in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia and, in particular, the Gulf of Guinea region off Nigeria, which experienced increased incidents of piracy in recent years. Sea piracy incidents continue to occur, increasingly in the Sulu Sea and the Gulf of Guinea, with drybulk vessels particularly vulnerable to such attacks. In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping. The perception that our vessels are a potential piracy or terrorist target could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, if these piracy attacks occur in regions in which our vessels are deployed that insurers characterize as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones or by the Joint War Committee as \u201cwar and strikes\u201d listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain, if available at all. In addition, crew costs, including costs that may be incurred to the extent we employ on-board security guards, could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and this may result in loss of revenues, increased costs and decreased cash flows to our customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to us under our charters.\nPolitical instability, terrorist attacks, international hostilities and global public health threats can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct most of our operations outside of the United States, and our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where our vessels are employed or registered. Moreover, we operate in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political conflicts, including the current political instability in the Middle East and the South China Sea region and other geographic countries and areas, geopolitical events such as Brexit, terrorist or other attacks, and war (or threatened war) or international hostilities, such as those between the United States and North Korea. Terrorist attacks as well as the frequent incidents of terrorism in the Middle East, and the continuing response of the United States and others to these attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks around the world, continues to cause uncertainty in the world's financial markets and may affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Continuing conflicts and recent developments in the Middle East, including increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as well as the presence of U.S. or other armed forces in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and various other regions, may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. As a result of the above, insurers have increased premiums and reduced or restricted coverage for losses caused by terrorist acts generally. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional\nfinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs. Additionally, Brexit, or similar events in other jurisdictions, could impact global markets, including foreign exchange and securities markets; any resulting changes in currency exchange rates, tariffs, treaties and other regulatory matters could in turn adversely impact our business and operations.\nFurther, governments may turn and have turned to trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against foreign imports, thereby depressing shipping demand. In particular, leaders in the United States and China have implemented certain increasingly protective trade measures. The results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election may improve the future relationship between the United States, China and other exporting countries, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. It is not yet clear how the new United States administration under President Biden may deviate from the former administration's protectionist foreign trade policies. Protectionist developments, or the perception that they may occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and may significantly reduce global trade. Moreover, increasing trade protectionism may cause an increase in (i) the cost of goods exported from regions globally, (ii) the length of time required to transport goods and (iii) the risks associated with exporting goods. Such increases may significantly affect the quantity of goods to be shipped, shipping time schedules, voyage costs and other associated costs, which could have an adverse impact on our charterers' business, operating results and financial condition and could thereby affect their ability to make timely charter hire payments to us and to renew and increase the number of their time charters with us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to pay any cash distributions to our stockholders.\nIn Europe, large sovereign debts and fiscal deficits, low growth prospects and high unemployment rates in a number of countries have contributed to the rise of Eurosceptic parties, which would like their countries to leave the Euro. The exit of the U.K. from the European Union, or Brexit, and potential new trade policies in the United States further increase the risk of additional trade protectionism.\nIn the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia.\nIn addition, public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate, including China, could adversely impact our operations, the timing of completion of scheduled dry-dockings and ballast water treatment system installation projects, as well as the operations of our customers.\nAny of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur financial results and operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, and related governmental responses thereto.\nSince the beginning of calendar year 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 that originated in China in late 2019 and that has spread to most nations around the globe has resulted in numerous actions taken by governments and governmental agencies in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, and other emergency public health measures, and a number of countries implemented lockdown measures. These measures have resulted in a significant reduction in global economic activity and extreme volatility in the global financial markets. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues on a prolonged basis or becomes more severe, the adverse impact on the global economy and the rate environment for cargo vessels may deteriorate further and our operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted. Relatively weak global economic conditions during periods of volatility have and may continue to have a number of adverse consequences for shipping sectors, including, among other things:\n\u2022low charter rates, particularly for vessels employed on short-term time charters or in the spot market\u037e\n\u2022limited second-hand market for the sale of vessels\u037e\n\u2022limited financing for vessels\n\u2022loan covenant defaults\u037e and\n\u2022declaration of bankruptcy by certain vessel operators, vessel owners, shipyards and charterers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain its spread have negatively impacted regional and global economies and trade patterns in markets in which we operate, the way we operate our business, and the businesses of our charterers and suppliers. These negative impacts could continue or worsen, even after the pandemic itself diminishes or ends. Companies, including us, have also taken precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely and imposing travel restrictions, while some other businesses have been required to close entirely. Moreover, we face significant risks to our personnel and operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our crews face risk of exposure to COVID-19 as a result of travel to ports in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Our shore-based personnel likewise face risk of such exposure, as we maintain offices in areas that have been impacted by the spread of COVID-19.\nMeasures against COVID-19 in a number of countries have restricted crew rotations on our vessels, which may continue or become more severe. As a result, in 2020, we experienced and may continue to experience disruptions to our normal vessel operations caused by increased deviation time associated with positioning our vessels to countries in which we can undertake a crew rotation in compliance with such measures. Delays in crew rotations have led to issues with crew fatigue and may continue to do so, which may result in delays or other operational issues. We have had and expect to continue to have increased expenses due to incremental fuel consumption and days in which our vessels are unable to earn revenue in order to deviate to certain ports on which we would ordinarily not call during a typical voyage. We may also incur additional expenses associated with testing, personal protective equipment, quarantines, and travel expenses such as airfare costs in order to perform crew rotations in the current environment. In 2020, delays in crew rotations have also caused us to incur additional costs related to crew bonuses paid to retain the existing crew members on board and may continue to do so.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures in place against the spread of the virus have led to a highly difficult environment in which to dispose of vessels given difficulty to physically inspect vessels. The impact of COVID-19 has also resulted in reduced industrial activity in China with temporary closures of factories and other facilities, labor shortages and restrictions on travel. We believe these disruptions along with other seasonal factors, including lower demand for some of the cargoes we carry, have contributed to lower rates in 2020.\nEpidemics may also affect personnel operating payment systems through which we receive revenues from the chartering of our vessels or pay for our expenses, resulting in delays in payments. Organizations across industries, including ours, are rightly focusing on their employees' well-being, whilst making sure that their operations continue undisrupted and at the same time, adapting to the new ways of operating. As such employees are encouraged or even required to operate remotely which significantly increases the risk of cyber security attacks.\nFurther, containment measures and quarantine restrictions adopted by many countries worldwide have caused significant impact on our ability to embark and disembark crew members and on our seafarers themselves. As a result, since the outbreak of COVID-19 and as of the date of this report, we have encountered certain prolonged delays and surrounding complexities in embarking and disembarking crew onto our ships which further resulted in increased operational costs and decreased revenues by reason of off-hires associated with crew rotation and related logistical complications associated with supplying our vessels with spares or other supplies.\nThe occurrence or continued occurrence of any of the foregoing events or other epidemics or an increase in the severity or duration of the COVID-19 or other epidemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, value of our vessels, and ability to pay dividends.\nOur revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect our operating results and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.\nWe operate our drybulk vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, in charter and freight rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results, which could affect our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. The drybulk carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter months due to demand increases arising from agricultural harvest and increased coal demand in preparation for winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. This seasonality may adversely affect our operating results and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.\nRisks associated with operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation, which could adversely affect our revenues and the price of our common shares.\nThe operation of ocean-going vessels carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of:\n\u2022marine disaster;\n\u2022environmental accidents;\n\u2022cargo and property losses or damage;\n\u2022business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions; and\n\u2022piracy.\nThe involvement of our vessels in an environmental disaster may harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator. Any of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues.\nThe operation of drybulk carriers entails certain unique operational risks.\nThe operation of certain ship types, such as drybulk carriers, has certain unique risks. With a drybulk carrier, the cargo itself and its interaction with the ship can be a risk factor. By their nature, drybulk cargoes are often heavy, dense, easily shifted, and react badly to water exposure. In addition, drybulk carriers are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold), and small bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the vessel. Vessels damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to breach at sea. Furthermore, any defects or flaws in the design of a drybulk carrier may contribute to vessel damage. Hull breaches in drybulk carriers may lead to the flooding of the vessels holds. If a drybulk carrier suffers flooding in its holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure may buckle the vessel's bulkheads, leading to the loss of the vessel. If we are unable to adequately maintain our vessels, we may be unable to prevent these events. Any of these circumstances or events could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. In addition, the loss of any of our vessels could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator.\nIf our vessels call on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S., the European Union, the United Nations, or other governmental authorities, it could lead to monetary fines or penalties and may adversely affect our reputation and the market for our securities.\nAlthough no vessels operated by us have called on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of country-wide or territory-wide sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government or other governmental authorities (\u201cSanctioned Jurisdictions\u201d) in violation of applicable sanctions or embargo laws in 2020, and we endeavor to take precautions reasonably designed to mitigate such risk, it is possible that, in the future, our vessels may call on ports located in Sanctioned Jurisdictions on our charterers\u2019 instructions and/or without our consent. If such activities result in a violation of sanctions or embargo laws, we could be subject to monetary fines, penalties, or other sanctions, and our reputation and the market for our common shares could be adversely affected.\nSanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or expanded over time. Current or future counterparties of ours may be affiliated with persons or entities that are or may be in the future the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S., the EU, and/or other international bodies. If we determine that such sanctions require us to terminate existing or future contracts to which we, or our subsidiaries, are party or if we are found to be in violation of such applicable sanctions, our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may suffer reputational harm.\nAlthough we believe that we have been in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, and intend to maintain such compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions that could negatively impact our ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct our business, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. In addition, certain institutional investors may have investment policies or restrictions that prevent them from holding securities of companies that have contracts with countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. The determination by these\ninvestors not to invest in, or to divest from, our securities may adversely affect the price at which our securities trade. Additionally, some investors may decide to divest their interest, or not to invest, in our company simply because we do business with companies that do business in sanctioned countries or territories. Moreover, our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not involve us or our vessels, and those violations could in turn negatively affect our reputation. In addition, our reputation and the market for our securities may be adversely affected if we engage in certain other activities, such as lawfully entering into charters with individuals or entities that are not controlled by the governments of countries or territories that are the subject of certain U.S. sanctions or embargo laws, or engaging in operations associated with those countries or territories pursuant to contracts with third parties that are unrelated to those countries or territories or entities controlled by their governments. Investor perception of the value of our common shares may be adversely affected by the consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in the countries or territories that we operate in.\nWe are subject to international safety regulations and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\nThe operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the United Nations\u2019 International Maritime Organization\u2019s International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code. The ISM Code requires ship owners and ship managers to develop and maintain an extensive \u201cSafety Management System\u201d that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation for dealing with emergencies. The failure of a shipowner to comply with the ISM Code may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. Each of the vessels owned or operated by the Company is ISM Code-certified.\nIn addition, vessel classification societies impose significant safety and other requirements on our vessels. In complying with current and future environmental requirements, vessel owners and operators may incur significant additional costs for maintenance and inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental protection requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and may require us to incur significant capital expenditures to keep our vessels in compliance.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and national and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the ownership cost and operation of our vessels. These requirements include, but are not limited to, European Union Regulations, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1975, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution of 1973, the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974, the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966, the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, the U.S. Clean Air Act, U.S. Clean Water Act, the U.S. Marine Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters.\nCompliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions including greenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault.\nWe are required to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. Although we have arranged insurance to cover certain environmental risks, there can be no assurance\nthat such insurance will be sufficient to cover all such risks or that any claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends.\nIn order to comply with new ballast water treatment requirements, we will have to install expensive ballast water treatment systems and modify our vessels to accommodate such systems.\nThe International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships\u2019 Ballast Water and Sediments (the \u201cBWM Convention\u201d), adopted by the UN International Maritime Organization in February 2004, calls for the prevention, reduction or elimination of the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention entered into force on September 8, 2017. In order to comply with these living organism limits, vessel owners will have to install expensive ballast water treatment systems and modify existing vessels to accommodate those systems or make port facility disposal arrangements, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, depending on the cost of available ballast water treatment systems and the extent to which existing vessels must be modified to accommodate such systems.\nIncreased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\nInternational shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin, destination and trans-shipment points. Inspection procedures may result in the seizure of the contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading or delivery of our vessels and the levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against us.\nIt is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaritime claimants could arrest one or more of our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a claimant may seek to obtain security for its claim by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the \u201csister ship\u201d theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any \u201cassociated\u201d vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could attempt to assert \u201csister ship\u201d liability against a vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another of our vessels.\nGovernments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in a loss of earnings.\nA government could requisition one or more of our vessels for title or for hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes her owner, while requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes her charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances. Although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our vessels, the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain. Government requisition of one or more of our vessels may negatively impact our revenues and reduce the amount of dividends, if any, in the future.\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\nFuel, or bunkers, is typically the largest expense of our operating business and therefore, changes in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability. When we operate vessels under COAs or voyage charters, we are responsible for all voyage costs, including bunkers. The price and supply of fuel can be unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the future, such as when new regulations requiring the use of low sulphur fuel went into effect in 2020. Increased fuel costs may reduce our profitability. We continually monitor the market volatility associated with bunker prices and seek to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of marine fuels with our bunker hedging program. Please see \u201cThe Company\u2019s Management and Discussion Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks - Fuel Swap Contracts.\u201d\nIn the highly competitive international shipping industry, we may not be able to compete successfully for chartered-in vessels or for vessel employment and, as a result, we may be unable to charter-in vessels at reasonable rates or employ our vessels profitably.\nWe charter-in and employ vessels in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly fragmented. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners and operators, some of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. Competition for seaborne transportation of drybulk cargo by sea is intense and depends on the charter or freight rate and on the location, size, age, condition and acceptability of a vessel and its operators. Due to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater resources are able to operate larger fleets and may be able to offer lower charter or freight rates and higher quality vessels than we are able to offer. If we are unable to successfully compete with other drybulk shipping operators, we may be unable to retain customers or attract new customers, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nLabor interruptions could disrupt our business.\nOur vessels are manned by masters, officers and crews that are contracted by our technical managers. If not resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner, industrial action or other labor unrest could prevent or hinder our operations from being carried out normally and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and on our ability to pay dividends.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. The increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors and lenders may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company\u2019s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry shareholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us, especially given the highly focused and specific trade of drybulk transportation in which we are engaged. If we do not meet these standards, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed.\nThese limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing the equity and debt capital markets. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness. Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with wide ranging ESG requirements. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses that may result from our operations due to the inherent operational risks of the seaborne transportation industry.\nWe carry insurance to protect us against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business, including marine hull and machinery insurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which include pollution risks, crew insurance and war risks insurance. However, we may not be adequately insured to cover all of our potential losses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, our insurers may refuse to pay particular claims, and our insurance may be voidable\nby the insurers if we take, or fail to take, certain action, such as failing to maintain certification of our vessels with the applicable maritime regulatory organizations. Any significant uninsured or under-insured loss or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to pay dividends. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future during adverse insurance market conditions.\nIn addition, we do not carry loss-of-hire insurance, which covers the loss of revenues during extended vessel off-hire periods, such as those that occur during an unscheduled drydocking due to damage to the vessel from accidents. Accordingly, any loss of a vessel or extended vessel off-hire, due to an accident or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends.\nThe logistics industry has its own set of risks, including infrastructure issues, operational efficiencies, lack of digital culture and training, labor relations and operational costs. We may not be able to provide logistics solutions to our customers in the face of obstacles created as a result of one of these factors.\nThe Company has dedicated resources to developing logistics solutions for our customers. These solutions may depend on infrastructure quality and improvement, the ability to hire qualified personnel, the ability to coordinate operations, development of digital integration and collaboration with suppliers and customers, and the ability to contain costs. If we are unable to facilitate these solutions due to any of these factors, we will not be able to continue developing such solutions.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could result in fines, criminal penalties, charter terminations and an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which is consistent and in full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA. We are subject, however, to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nOur business strategy includes chartering-in vessels, and we may not be able to charter-in suitable vessels.\nOur business strategy depends, in large part, on our ability to charter-in vessels. If we are not able to find suitable vessels to charter-in, or to charter-in vessels at what we deem to be a reasonable rate, we may not be able to operate profitably or perform our contractual obligations. As a result, we may need to adjust our business strategy, and we may experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we charter-in a vessel and shipping rates subsequently decrease, or we are unable to secure employment for such a vessel, our obligation under the charter may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon a few significant customers for a large part of our revenues and cash flow, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe expect to derive a significant part of our revenue and cash flow from a relatively small number of repeat customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 10% of total revenue and all of our top ten customers, representing 44% of total revenue, are repeat customers. If one or more of our significant customers is unable to perform under one or more charters or COAs and we are not able to find a replacement charter or COA; or if a customer exercises certain rights to terminate the charter or COA, we could suffer a loss of revenues that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution as dividends to our shareholders.\nWe could lose a customer or the benefits of a charter or COA if, among other things:\n\u2022the customer fails to make charter payments because of its financial inability, disagreements with us or otherwise; or\n\u2022the customer terminates the charter because we do not perform in accordance with such charter and do not cure such failures within a specified period.\nIf we lose a key customer, we may be unable to obtain replacement charters or COAs on comparable terms or at all. The loss of any of our customers, COAs, charters or vessels, or a decline in payments under our agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are a holding company, and depend on the ability of our subsidiaries, through which we operate our business, to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations or to make dividend payments.\nWe are a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. The equity interests in our vessel-owning subsidiaries represent a significant portion of our operating assets. As a result, our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate profits available for distribution to us and, to the extent that they are unable to generate profits, we will be unable to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to certain risks with counterparties on contracts and the failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business and ability to comply with covenants in our loan agreements.\nWe enter into various contracts that are material to the operation of our business, including COAs, time charters and voyage charters under which we employ our vessels, and charter agreements under which we charter-in vessels. We also enter into loan agreements and hedging agreements, such as bunker swap agreements and forward freight agreements, or FFAs. Such agreements subject us to counterparty risks. The ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the drybulk shipping industry, the overall financial condition of our counterparty, prevailing prices for drybulk cargoes, rates received for specific types of vessels and voyages, and various expenses. In addition, in depressed market conditions, our customers may no longer need us to carry a cargo that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain carriage at a lower rate. If our customers fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate our agreements, it may be difficult to secure suitable substitute employment for the vessel, and any new charter arrangements we secure may be at lower rates or, if our counterparties fail to deliver a vessel we have agreed to charter-in, or if a counterparty otherwise fails to honor its obligations to us under a contract, we could sustain significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends to holders of our common shares in the amounts anticipated or at all and compliance with covenants in our secured loan agreements.\nAdditionally, we are subject to certain risks as a result of using our vessels as collateral. If we are in breach of financial covenants contained in our loan agreements, we may not be successful in obtaining waivers and amendments. If our indebtedness is accelerated, it may be difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our vessels if our lenders foreclose on their liens.\nWe may be unable to comply with covenants in our credit facilities or any financial obligations that impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur credit facilities and finance leases, which are secured by mortgages on our vessels, impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us, mainly to ensure that the market value of the mortgaged vessel under the applicable credit facility does not fall below a certain percentage of the outstanding amount of the loan, which we refer to as the collateral maintenance or loan to value ratio. In addition, certain of our credit facilities include other financial covenants, which require us to, among other things, maintain:\n\u2022a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 200%;\n\u2022a consolidated debt service coverage ratio of not less than 120%;\n\u2022Minimum consolidated net worth of $45 million plus, with respect to any vessel purchased or leased by the Guarantor or its subsidiaries, for so long as such vessels are legally or economically owned, 25% of the purchase price or (finance) lease amount of such vessels;\n\u2022consolidated minimum liquidity of not less than $18 million\nIn general, the operating restrictions that are contained in our credit facilities may prohibit or otherwise limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022effect changes in management of our vessels;\n\u2022sell or dispose of any of our assets, including our vessels;\n\u2022declare and pay dividends;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022mortgage our vessels; and\n\u2022incur and pay management fees or commissions.\nNon-compliance with any of our financial covenants or operating restrictions contained in our credit facilities may constitute an event of default under our credit facilities, which, unless cured within the grace period set forth under the applicable credit facility, if applicable, or waived or modified by our lenders, provides our lenders with the right to, among other things, require us to post additional collateral, enhance our equity and liquidity, increase our interest payments, pay down our indebtedness to a level where we are in compliance, sell vessels in our fleet, reclassify our indebtedness as current liabilities, accelerate our indebtedness, or foreclose their liens on our vessels and the other assets securing the credit facilities, which would impair our ability to continue to conduct our business. As of December 31, 2020, we are in compliance with covenants contained in our debt agreements. Please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Borrowing Activities.\u201d\nFurthermore, certain of our credit facilities contain a cross-default provision that may be triggered by a default under one of our other credit facilities. A cross-default provision means that a default on one loan would result in a default on certain other loans. Because of the presence of cross-default provisions in certain of our credit facilities, the refusal of any one lender under our credit facilities to grant or extend a waiver could result in certain of our indebtedness being accelerated. If our secured indebtedness is accelerated in full or in part, it would be very difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our vessels and other assets securing our credit facilities if our lenders foreclose their liens, which would adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our growth strategy.\nOne of our principal business strategies is to continue to expand capacity and flexibility by increasing our owned fleet as we secure additional demand for our services. Our growth strategy will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within our control. These factors include our ability to:\n\u2022enter into new contracts for the transportation of cargoes;\n\u2022develop customized logistics solutions within targeted dry bulk trades;\n\u2022locate and acquire suitable vessels for acquisitions at attractive prices;\n\u2022obtain required financing for our existing and new operations;\n\u2022integrate any acquired vessels successfully with our existing operations, including obtaining any approvals and qualifications necessary to operate vessels that we acquire;\n\u2022enhance our customer base;\n\u2022hire, train and retain qualified personnel and crew to manage and operate our growing business and fleet;\n\u2022identify additional new markets; and\n\u2022improve our operating, financial and accounting systems and controls.\nWe may undertake future financings to finance our growth. Our failure to effectively identify, purchase, develop and integrate any vessels could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The number of employees that perform services for us and our current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we implement our plan to expand the size of our fleet, and we may not be able to effectively hire more employees or adequately improve those systems. Finally, acquisitions may require additional equity issuances or debt issuances (with amortization payments), both of which could lower our available cash. If any such events occur, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nGrowing any business presents numerous risks such as difficulty in obtaining additional qualified personnel and managing relationships with customers and suppliers. The expansion of our fleet may impose significant additional responsibilities on our management and staff, and may necessitate that we increase the number of personnel. We cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in executing our growth plans or that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with our future growth.\nInvestment in forward freight agreements and other derivative instruments could result in losses.\nWe manage our market exposure using forward freight agreements, or FFAs, and other derivative instruments, such as bunker hedging contracts. FFAs are cash-settled derivative contracts based on future freight delivery rates and other derivative instruments. FFAs may be used to hedge exposure to the changing rates by providing for the purchase or sale of a contracted charter rate along a specified route or combination of routes and over a specified period of time. Upon settlement, if the contracted charter rate is less than the settlement rate, the seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate, multiplied by the number of days in the specified period. Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum. If we take positions in FFAs and do not correctly anticipate rate movements for the specified vessel route or routes and relevant time period or our assumptions regarding the relative relationships of certain vessels\u2019 earnings, routes and other factors relevant to the FFA markets are incorrect, we could suffer losses in settling or terminating our FFAs. In addition, we normally do not designate our FFAs for special hedge accounting and, as such, our use of such derivatives may lead to material fluctuations in our results of operations.\nWe also seek to manage our exposure to volatility in the market price of bunkers by entering into bunker hedging contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully limit our risks, leaving us exposed to unprofitable contracts and we may suffer significant losses from these hedging activities.\nOur long-term COAs, single charter bookings and time-charter agreements may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results, which may adversely affect our liquidity, as well as our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we enter into long-term COAs, single charter bookings and time-charter agreements. We evaluate entering into long-term positions based on the expected return over the full term of the contract. However, long-term contracts that we believe provide attractive returns over their full term may produce losses over portions of the contract period. We may be required to provide additional margin collateral in connection with FFA positions that are settled through clearinghouses, depending upon movements in the FFA markets. These interim losses, fluctuations in our quarterly results or incremental collateral requirements may adversely affect our financial liquidity, as well as our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.\nWe depend on COAs, which could require us to operate at unfavorable rates for a certain amount of time or subject us to other operating risks.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from COAs. While COAs provide a relatively stable and predictable source of revenue, they typically fix the rate we are paid for our drybulk shipping services. Once we have entered into a COA, if we have not correctly anticipated vessel rates, location and availability for our owned or chartered-in fleet to fulfill the COA, we could suffer losses. Moreover, factors beyond our control may cause a COA to become unprofitable. Nevertheless, we would be obligated to continue to perform for the term of the COA. In addition, factors beyond our control, such as vessel availability, port delays, changes in government or industry rules or regulation, industrial actions or acts of terrorism or war, could affect our ability to perform our obligations under our COAs, which could result in breach of contract or other claims by our COA counterparties. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and a \"non-accelerated filer\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined in the Securities Act of 1934, and may choose to rely on scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies. On June 28, 2018, the Commission adopted amendments to the definition of \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d that became effective on September 10, 2018. Under the new definition, generally, a company qualifies as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d if it has public float of less than $250 million; or it has less than $100 million in annual revenues and no public float or public float of less than $700 million.\nThe scaled disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies permit us to include less extensive narrative disclosure than required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation and to provide audited financial statements for two fiscal years, in contrast to other reporting companies, which must provide audited financial statements for three fiscal years.\nIn addition to the accommodations that are available to smaller reporting companies, there are also different requirements that apply to \u201cnon-accelerated filers\u201d and \u201caccelerated filers.\u201d Generally, if a smaller reporting company has no public float or public float of less than $75 million, it will be a non-accelerated filer. A non-accelerated filer is not required to provide an auditor attestation of management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which is generally required for SEC reporting companies under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b), and, in contrast to other reporting companies, has more time to file its periodic reports. If a smaller reporting company has public float of $75 million or more, it will be an accelerated filer. Among other requirements, accelerated filers are required to provide an auditor\u2019s attestation of management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting required under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nInvestors may find our common shares and the price of our common shares less attractive because we rely, or may rely, on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and the price of our common shares may be more volatile.\nObligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention, and we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including Sarbanes-Oxley, and requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. These requirements and rules may place a strain on our systems and resources. For example, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we document and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources and we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a result. The expenses incurred by public companies, generally, for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing and the costs we incur for such purposes may strain our resources. We may implement additional financial and management controls and procedures, reporting and business intelligence systems, create or outsource an internal audit function, or hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. In addition, our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying with these reporting and other requirements while focusing on executing our business strategy. Our incremental general and administrative expenses as a publicly traded corporation include costs associated with preparing reports to shareholders, tax returns, investor relations, registrar and transfer agent\u2019s fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common shares, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. However, as a smaller reporting company that is also a non-accelerated filer, we are exempt from certain of its requirements for so long as we remain so. For example, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that the Company and its independent auditors report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, as a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer, we may take advantage of an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement. Once we are no longer a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer, or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management, however, is not exempt from this requirement, and is required to, among other things, maintain and periodically evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process documentation, evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow us to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nA failure to pass inspection by classification societies could result in vessels being unemployable until they pass inspection, resulting in a loss of revenues from such vessels for that period.\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the United Nations Safety of Life at Sea Convention. Our owned fleet is currently enrolled with Bureau Veritas (BV), DNV GL Group (DNV), and Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NK).\nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel\u2019s machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Our vessels are on special survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel must undergo regulatory surveys of its underwater parts every 30 to 60 months.\nIf a vessel fails any annual survey, intermediate survey or special survey, the vessel may be unable to trade between ports and, therefore, would be unemployable, potentially causing a negative impact on our revenues due to the loss of revenues from such vessel until it was able to trade again.\nBecause we purchase and operate secondhand vessels, we may be exposed to increased operating costs which could adversely affect our earnings and, as our fleet ages, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\nAs part of our current business strategy to increase our owned fleet, we may acquire new and secondhand vessels. While we inspect secondhand vessels prior to purchase, this does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Accordingly, we may not discover defects or other problems with secondhand vessels prior to purchasing or chartering-in, or may incur costs to terminate a purchase agreement. Any such hidden defects or problems may be expensive to repair, and if not detected, may result in accidents or other incidents for which we may become liable to third parties.\nIn general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. Older vessels are typically less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers.\nFurthermore, governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may require expenditures for alterations, or the addition of new equipment and may restrict the type of activities in which the vessel may engage. As our vessels age, market conditions may not justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives.\nUnless we set aside reserves or are able to borrow funds for vessel replacement, we will be unable to replace the vessels in our fleet at the end of their useful lives.\nWe estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 or 30 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. The remaining estimated useful lives of our vessels range from 8 - 22 years, depending on the age and type of vessel. The average age of our owned drybulk carriers at the time of this filing is approximately 10 years. A portion of our cash flows and income are dependent on the revenues earned by employing our vessels. If we are unable to replace the vessels in our fleet at the end of their useful lives, our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends could be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain reserves for vessel replacements. We intend to finance vessel replacements from internally generated cash flow, borrowings under our credit facilities or additional equity or debt offerings.\nOur ability to obtain additional debt financing, or to refinance existing indebtedness, may be dependent on the performance and length of our COAs and charters, and the creditworthiness of our contract counterparties.\nThe performance and length of our COAs and charters and the actual or perceived credit quality of our contract counterparties, and any defaults by them, may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional capital resources required to purchase additional vessels or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such capital. Our inability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all may materially affect our results of operations and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe intend to partially finance the acquisition of vessels with borrowings drawn under credit facilities or finance lease obligations. While we may refinance amounts drawn under our credit facilities with the net proceeds of future debt and equity offerings, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we are not able to refinance these amounts with the net proceeds of debt and equity offerings at an interest rate or on terms\nacceptable to us or at all, we will have to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest of this indebtedness. If we are not able to satisfy these obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans or sell vessels. The actual or perceived credit quality of our contract counterparties, any defaults by them and the market value of our fleet, among other things, may materially affect our ability to obtain alternative financing. In addition, debt service payments under our credit facilities, finance lease obligations or alternative financing may limit funds otherwise available for working capital, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends and other purposes. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations, or if we otherwise default under our credit facilities or alternative financing arrangements, our lenders could declare the debt, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on our fleet, which could result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have at such time and the commencement of similar foreclosure proceedings by other lenders.\nWe depend on our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other key employees, and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\nWe depend on the efforts, knowledge, skill, reputations and business contacts of our Chief Executive Officer, Edward Coll, our Chief Financial Officer, Gianni Del Signore, our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Filanowski, and other key employees, including Mads Boye Petersen, Peter Koken, Robert Seward, Neil McLaughlin and Fotis Doussopoulos. Accordingly, our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or employees. We may experience departures of senior executive officers and other key employees, and we cannot predict the impact that any of their departures would have on our ability to achieve our financial objectives. The loss of the services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will result in fluctuations in our cash flows and operating results.\nWe may generate our revenues and incur some of our operating expenses and general and administrative expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This difference could lead to fluctuations in our revenues and vessel operating expenses, which would affect our financial results. Expenses incurred in foreign currencies increase when the value of the U.S. dollar falls, which would reduce our profitability. Our operating results could suffer as a result.\nWe may be subject to litigation, arbitration and other proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business\nWe may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, or otherwise. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, securities, or maritime matters. The potential costs to resolve any claim or other litigation matter, or a combination of these, may have a material adverse effect on us because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with asserting our claims or defending such lawsuits, and the diversion of management's attention to these matters.\nUnited States tax authorities could treat us as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d which could have adverse United States federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders\nA foreign corporation will be treated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of \u201cpassive income\u201d or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of \u201cpassive income.\u201d For purposes of these tests, \u201cpassive income\u201d includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute \u201cpassive income.\u201d United States shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous United States federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC.\nBased on our proposed method of operation, we do not believe that we will be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute \u201cpassive income,\u201d and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets.\nThere is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our proposed method of operation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations.\nIf the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our United States shareholders will face adverse United States tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election available under the Code (which election could itself have adverse consequences for such shareholders), such shareholders would be liable to pay United States federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder\u2019s holding period of our common shares.\nWe may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings\nUnder sections 863(c)(3) and 887(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the \u201cCode,\u201d 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves and our subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States may be subject to a 4% United States federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations recently promulgated thereunder.\nIf we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to exemption under Code section 883 for any taxable year, we or our subsidiaries could be subject for those years to an effective 2% United States federal income tax on the shipping income these companies derive during the year that are attributable to the transport of cargoes to or from the United States. The imposition of this taxation would have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe have had and in the future may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements\nOur management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including on our vessels. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including on our vessels. The safety and security of our vessels and efficient operation of our business, including processing, transmitting and storing electronic and financial information, are dependent on computer hardware and software systems, which are increasingly vulnerable to security breaches and other disruptions. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur vessels rely on information systems for a significant part of their operations, including navigation, provision of services, propulsion, machinery management, power control, communications and cargo management. We have in place safety and security measures on our vessels and onshore operations to secure our vessels against cyber-security attacks and any disruption to their information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches despite our continuous efforts to upgrade and address the latest known threats. A disruption to the information system of any of our vessels could lead to, among other things, wrong routing, collision, grounding and propulsion failure.\nBeyond our vessels, we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. The technology and other controls and processes designed to secure our confidential and proprietary information, detect and remedy any unauthorized access to that information were designed to obtain reasonable, but not\nabsolute, assurance that such information is secure and that any unauthorized access is identified and addressed appropriately. Such controls may in the future fail to prevent or detect, unauthorized access to our confidential and proprietary information. In addition, the foregoing events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws. If confidential information is inappropriately accessed and used by a third party or an employee for illegal purposes, we may be responsible to the affected individuals for any losses they may have incurred as a result of misappropriation. In such an instance, we may also be subject to regulatory action, investigation or liable to a governmental authority for fines or penalties associated with a lapse in the integrity and security of our information systems.\nOur operations, including our vessels, and business administration could be targeted by individuals or groups seeking to sabotage or disrupt such systems and networks, or to steal data, and these systems may be damaged, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, other cyber-security incidents or otherwise). For example, the information systems of our vessels may be subject to threats from hostile cyber or physical attacks, phishing attacks, human errors of omission or commission, structural failures of resources we control, including hardware and software, and accidents and other failures beyond our control. The threats to our information systems are constantly evolving, and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated. Furthermore, such threats change frequently and are often not recognized or detected until after they have been launched, and therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these threats and may not become aware in a timely manner of such a security breach, which could exacerbate any damage we experience.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences. A cyber-attack could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damages and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and diminished customer confidence. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful and we may not have adequate insurance to cover these losses.\nThe unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related To Our Common Shares\nFuture sales of our common shares could cause the market price of our common shares to decline.\nThe market price of our common shares could decline due to sales of a large number of shares in the market, including sales of shares by our large shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common shares.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all or which may dilute our common shares or adversely affect its market price.\nWe may require additional capital to expand our business and increase revenues, add liquidity in response to negative economic conditions, meet unexpected liquidity needs caused by industry volatility or uncertainty and reduce our outstanding indebtedness under our existing facilities. To the extent that our existing capital and borrowing capabilities are insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we will need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings, including offerings of our common shares, securities convertible into our common shares, or rights to acquire our common shares, or curtail our growth and reduce our assets or restructure arrangements with existing security holders. Any equity or debt financing, or additional borrowings, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders, as described further below, and the securities issued in future financings may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common shares. If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements.\nFuture issuances of our common shares could dilute our shareholders\u2019 interests in our company.\nWe may, from time to time, issue additional common shares to support our growth strategy, reduce debt or provide us with capital for other purposes that our Board of Directors believes to be in our best interest. To the extent that an existing shareholder does not purchase additional shares that we issue, that shareholder\u2019s interest in our company will be diluted, which means that its percentage of ownership in our company will be reduced. Following such a reduction, that shareholder\u2019s common shares would represent a smaller percentage of the vote in our Board of Directors\u2019 elections and other shareholder decisions.\nVolatility in the market price and trading volume of our common shares could adversely impact the trading price of our common shares.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market factors may materially reduce the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. The market price of our common shares, which has experienced significant price fluctuations in the past twelve months, could continue to fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described herein or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability.\nClassified Board of Directors.\nOur Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered, three-year terms. This classified board provision could discourage a third party from making a tender offer for our shares or attempting to obtain control of us. It could also delay shareholders who do not agree with the policies of our Board of Directors from removing a majority of our Board of Directors for up to two years.\nWe are incorporated in Bermuda and it may not be possible for our investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us.\nWe are incorporated in Bermuda and substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, one of our directors is a non-resident of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such director\u2019s assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to serve process within the United States, upon us or our directors and executive officers, or to enforce a judgment against us for civil liabilities in United States courts.\nIn addition, you should not assume that courts in the countries in which we are incorporated or where our assets are located would enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against us based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable United States federal and state securities laws or would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us based on those laws.\nBecause we are a foreign corporation, you may not have the same rights that a shareholder in a U.S. corporation may have.\nWe are a Bermuda exempted company. Our memorandum of association and bye-laws and the Companies Act, 1981 of Bermuda, or the Companies Act, govern our affairs. The Companies Act does not as clearly establish your rights and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors as do statutes and judicial precedent in some United States jurisdictions. Therefore, you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests as a shareholder in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction. There is a statutory remedy under Section 111 of the Companies Act which provides that a shareholder may seek redress in the courts as long as such shareholder can establish that our affairs are being conducted, or have been conducted, in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some part of the shareholders, including such shareholder. However, you may not have the same rights that a shareholder in a United States corporation may have.", "PERMNO": 14353, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "PANL"}
