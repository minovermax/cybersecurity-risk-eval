{"cik": "1001907", "company": "ASTROTECH Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. This annual report will contain a discussion of the risks applicable to an investment in our securities. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific factors discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the offered securities.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $199.8 million and reported a net loss of $8.3 million for the fiscal year 2020. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. If we are unable to achieve and then maintain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely experience significant decline.\nWe could face risks related to the potential outcomes of SEC inquiries, including potential regulatory action or private litigation, potential penalties, damages or other remedies that could be imposed on us, substantial legal costs and expenses, significant management distraction, and potential reputational damage that we could suffer as a result of adverse findings resulting from any SEC inquiry.\nSince April 2020, the staff of the Fort Worth Regional Office of the SEC has been conducting an investigation relating to certain press releases issued by us in March 2020 regarding the BreathTest-1000\u2122 lung disease screening device that we are currently developing. The SEC has advised us that this informal, non-public, fact-finding inquiry should not be construed as an indication that we or anyone else has violated the law or that the SEC has any negative opinion of any person, entity or security. In connection with this inquiry, the SEC staff has requested that we voluntarily provide certain information and documents relating to the development of BreathTest-1000, the common stock offerings completed by us in March 2020, and certain related matters. We have been cooperating with the SEC staff regarding this inquiry and have provided information and documents in response to the SEC staff\u2019s request. We do not intend to comment further on this matter unless and until this matter is closed or further action is taken by the SEC that, in our judgment, merits further comment or public disclosure.\nOur business units are in development stage. They have earned limited revenues and it is uncertain whether they will earn any revenues in the future or whether any of them will ultimately be profitable.\nOur business units are in an early stage with a limited operating history. Their future operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business including, but not limited to, risks related to capital requirements, failure to establish business relationships, and competitive disadvantages against larger and more established companies. These business units will require substantial amounts of funding to continue to commercialize their products. If such funding comes in the form of equity financing, such equity financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. Even with funding, our products may fail to be effective or attractive to the market or lack the necessary financial or other resources or relationships to be successful.\nThese business units can be expected to experience continued operating losses until they can generate sufficient revenues to cover their operating costs. Furthermore, these business units may not be able to develop, manufacture, or market additional products in the future, that future revenues will be significant, that any sales will be profitable, or that the business units will have sufficient funds available to complete their commercialization efforts.\nAny products and technologies developed and manufactured by our business units may require regulatory approvals prior to being made, marketed, sold, and used. Regulatory approval of any products may not be obtained. In particular, FDA approval will be required to market the BreathTest-1000 in the United States. Obtaining FDA approval is a complex and lengthy process, and FDA approval for the BreathTest-1000 may not be granted on a timely basis or at all.\nThe commercial success of any of our business units will depend, in part, on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in any products it developed. In addition, our business units may need to license intellectual property to commercialize future products or avoid infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.\nLicenses may not be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. Our business units may suffer if any licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid, or if our respective business unit is unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. If such business unit, or any third-party, from whom it licenses intellectual property, fails to obtain adequate patent or other intellectual property protection for intellectual property covering its products, or if any protection is reduced or eliminated, others could use the intellectual property covering the products, resulting in harm to the competitive business position of this business unit. In addition, patent and other intellectual property protection may not provide our business units with a competitive advantage against competitors that devise ways of making competitive products without infringing any patents that this business unit owns or has rights to. Such competition could adversely affect the prices for any products or the market share of any of our business units and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nOur cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital equipment requirements, and other expected liquidity requirements.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products, payments under possible future strategic arrangements, continued progress of our research and development of potential products, the need to acquire licenses to new technology, costs associated with increasing our manufacturing and development facilities, costs associated with strategic acquisitions including integration costs and assumed liabilities, litigation expense, the status of competitive products, and potential cost associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property. Additionally, actions taken as a result of the ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures that are not currently contemplated. Factors that could affect our capital requirements, in addition to those listed above include continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience and our ability to manage product development efforts.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop the BreathTest-1000\u2122 or any other new products or services.\nOur business strategy outlines the use of the decades of experience we have accumulated to expand the services and products we offer to both U.S. government agencies and commercial industries. These services and products are in the development stage and involve new and untested technologies and business models. These technologies and business models may not be successful, which could result in the loss of any investment we make in developing them, including the development of the BreathTest-1000.\nFurthermore, we are subject to risks including, but not limited to, the following with respect to the development of the BreathTest-1000:\n\u2022\nthe governmental approval process could be lengthy, time consuming and is inherently unpredictable, and we cannot guarantee that the required approvals for our products, including FDA approvals, will be granted on a timely basis or at all or that we will ever have a marketable product;\n\u2022\ncustomers must be persuaded that using our products are effective alternatives to other existing detection methods available for COVID-19 in order for our products to be commercially successful;\n\u2022\nif we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial enforcement actions, including civil and criminal penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nProduct development involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, and our potential products may not be successfully developed, achieve their intended benefits, receive full market authorization, or be commercially successful. Moreover, as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and further information continues to develop, we are learning of increased risks and uncertainties in developing and commercializing new products and services in these unprecedented and evolving circumstances.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced airline passenger traffic, which reduces demand for certain of our\nsecurity screening products and services. To slow and limit the transmission of COVID-19, governments across the world have imposed significant air travel restrictions and businesses and individuals have canceled air travel plans. These restrictions and cancelations have reduced demand for security screening products and related services at airport checkpoints globally as the number of airline passengers requiring screening has fallen. The pandemic has also hampered our ability to meet with our customers and prospective customers. The continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to recent disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These costs may not be recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.\nIt is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could also further cause disruption in our supply chain; cause delay, or limit the ability of customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us; cause delay in regulatory certification testing of our instruments; and cause other unpredictable events. If any of our supply chain phases were interrupted or terminated, we could experience delays in our product development including the availability of products for clinical testing. The occurrence of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, any future clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 and adversely impact our clinical trial operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market LLC, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur stockholders\u2019 equity as of June 30, 2020 was less than $2.5 million, which is less than the requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, though no assurance can be given, we anticipate that Nasdaq will provide notice of this development and require us to take steps in order to avoid the delisting of our common stock.\nWe cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms when needed, or at all, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe have incurred net losses and negative cash flow from operations in recent prior periods, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our cash on hand at June 30, 2020 is expected to fund our operations into the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As a result, we may need additional financing to execute our business plan. We may pursue additional funding through various financing sources, including additional public offerings, the issuance of debt securities, fees associated with licensing some or all of our technology, joint ventures with capital partners and project type financing. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets, and other factors. Therefore, we may need to raise additional funds and we cannot assure investors that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked, or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose some or all of your investment.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, indicating the possibility that we may not be able to operate in the future. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm also includes an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had working capital of $0.3 million. For the fiscal year 2020, we reported a net loss of $8.3 million and net cash used in operating activities of $6.9 million. For the fiscal year 2019, we reported a net loss of $7.5 million and net cash used in operating activities of $8.5 million. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, the sale of the shares of our common stock or obtaining alternate financing.\nOn April 14, 2020, we entered into a $542 thousand Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note and Agreement (the \u201cPPP Promissory Note\u201d) with a commercial bank under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) The PPP Promissory Note bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. Payments are due monthly beginning November 10, 2020. The principal amount of the PPP Promissory Note along with any unpaid interest is due on April 1, 2022 The principal and interest may be forgiven if the proceeds are used for forgivable purposes as defined by the terms in the PPP Promissory Note, and we have used the proceeds from the PPP Promissory Note for forgivable purposes as defined by the terms of the PPP Promissory Note. We intend to apply for forgiveness under the provisions of the CARES Act. Forgiveness is subject to the sole approval of the Small Business Administration.\nWe remain resolute in identifying the optimal solution to its liquidity issue. We are currently evaluating several potential sources of additional liquidity. These include, but are not limited to, selling the Company or a portion thereof, debt financing, equity financing, merging, or engaging in a strategic partnership. The Company is currently evaluating potential offerings of any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, or any combination of the foregoing, either individually or as units comprised of one or more of the other securities. However, additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to generate funding within a reasonable timeframe, we may have to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs, limit strategic opportunities, or curtail our business activities. Astrotech\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2020 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur success depends significantly on the establishment and maintenance of successful relationships with our customers.\nOur customer base is limited; therefore, we continue to work on diversifying our customer base, while going to great lengths to satisfy the needs of our current customer base. Due to the limited number of customers, if any of our customers terminate their relationship with us, it could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\nAs we introduce any new and potentially promising product or service, or improve existing products or services with new features or components, companies possessing competing technologies, or other companies owning patents or other intellectual property rights, may be motivated to assert infringement claims in order to generate royalty revenues, delay or diminish potential sales, and challenge our right to market such products or services. Even if successful in defending against such claims, patent and other intellectual property related litigation is costly and time consuming. In addition, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation in order to protect our patent or other intellectual property rights, and even if the claims are well-founded and ultimately successful, such litigation is typically costly and time-consuming and may expose us to counterclaims, including claims for intellectual property infringement, antitrust, or other such claims. Third parties could also obtain patents or other intellectual property rights that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, importing, distributing, selling, or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies. Under any of these circumstances, we may incur significant expenses.\nOur ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees.\nWe are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees, many of whom are individually key to our current and future success, and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans. The market for skilled employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in technical fields. While our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful, ultimately, we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans. In addition, we may not be able to continue to attract new employees as required.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by increased competition.\nWe generally sell our products in industries that have increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes, and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services, and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify customer needs and predict future needs;\n\u2022\ninnovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our offering from our competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022\nprice our products competitively;\n\u2022\nanticipate our competitors\u2019 development of new products, services, or technological innovations; and\n\u2022\ncontrol product quantity in our manufacturing process.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks, and we believe our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. However, the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, services, and data.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to the security of our and our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019, and third-party service providers\u2019 products, systems, and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our and our customers\u2019 data. Although we have implemented policies, procedures, and controls to protect against, detect, and mitigate these threats, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. We also have access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors, and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information, improper use of our systems or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes, and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness and remediation or increased protection costs, and could subject us to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions.\nOur facilities located in Houston are susceptible to damage caused by hurricanes or other natural disasters.\nOur 1st Detect facilities in Houston are susceptible to damage caused by hurricanes or other natural disasters. Although we insure our properties and maintain business interruption insurance, there can be no guarantee that the coverage would be sufficient or a claim will be fulfilled. A natural disaster could result in a temporary or permanent closure of our business operations, thus impacting our future financial performance.\nIf we are unable to anticipate technological advances and customer requirements in the commercial and governmental markets, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy employs our personnel\u2019s decades of experience to expand the services and products we offer to our customers. We believe that our growth and future financial performance depend upon our ability to anticipate technological advances and customer requirements. We may not be able to achieve the necessary technological advances for us to remain competitive. Our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technological and market requirements, or delays in additional product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Additionally, the cost of capital to fund these businesses will likely require dilution of shareholders.\nSignificant safety concerns could arise for our BreathTest-1000\u2122 product, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and financial condition.\nIf the development of the BreathTest-1000 is successfully completed, FDA approval will need to be obtained to market the BreathTest-1000 in the United States. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, we may be required to amend the conditions of use. For example, we may be required to provide additional warnings on the BreathTest-1000 label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product\u2019s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with the BreathTest-1000 product, sales of the product could be halted by us or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers\u2019 or competitors\u2019 products also may reduce the market acceptance of our products.\nWe incur substantial upfront, non-reimbursable costs in preparing proposals to bid on contracts or to receive research and development grants that we may not be awarded.\nPreparing a proposal to bid on a contract or to receive a research and development grant is labor-intensive and results in the incurrence of substantial costs that are generally not retrievable. Additionally, although we may be awarded a contract or grant, work performance does not commence for several months following completion of the bidding process. If funding problems by the party awarding the contract or grant or other matters further delay our commencement of work, these delays may lower the value of the contract or grant, or possibly render it unprofitable.\nA failure of a key information technology system, process, or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to interact with our employees and our customers. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, transmitting data used by our service personnel and by and among our personnel and facilities, complying with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from the failures of third-party service providers, to catastrophic events, to power outages, to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of the common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our shareholders sell, or the market perceives that our shareholders intend to sell for various reasons, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to such companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, (i.e. a company with less than $250 million of public float) and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a\nresult of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and publicly disclose any material weaknesses in our controls. Any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and significant expense to remediate, and ultimately could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. We have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs, implement necessary changes to our controls design, and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company will have been detected.\nIf we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or Nasdaq. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. Execution of restatements create a significant strain on our internal resources and could cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results, increase our costs, and cause management distraction. Restatements may also significantly affect our stock price in an adverse manner.\nWe can sell additional shares of common stock without consulting shareholders and without offering shares to existing shareholders, which would result in dilution of shareholders\u2019 interests in the Company and could depress our stock price.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 50,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,850,362 were outstanding as of June 30, 2020, and our Board is authorized to issue additional shares of our common stock. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 2,500,000 shares of \u201cblank check preferred stock.\u201d Shares of \u201cblank check preferred stock\u201d may be issued in such series and with such rights, privileges, and limitations as the Board may, in its sole discretion, determine. Our Board has designated 300,000 shares as Series A Junior Preferred Stock, none of which are outstanding. The Board has also designated Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, of which no shares and 280,898 shares are outstanding, respectively, as of June 30, 2020.\nAlthough our Board intends to utilize its reasonable business judgment to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to our then existing shareholders in connection with any future issuance of our capital stock, the future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock would cause immediate, and potentially substantial, dilution to our existing shareholders, which could also have a material effect on the market value of the shares. Furthermore, our Board may authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock, and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. In addition, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than the common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of the common stock or result in dilution to our existing shareholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for many disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors or officers.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for claims brought by a stockholder, including claims in the right of the corporation, (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity or (ii) as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The provision indicates that if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, then the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, or, if such other court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, shall be the exclusive forum for such action.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find our choice of forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nThe medical technology industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and state regulatory agencies with oversight of various aspects of drug and device distribution, sale, and use. The regulations are very complex, have become more stringent over time, and are subject to rapid change and varying interpretations. Regulatory restrictions or changes could limit our ability to carry on or expand our operations or result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA and other federal and state governmental agencies regulate numerous elements of our business, including:\n\u2022\nproduct design and development;\n\u2022\npre-clinical and clinical testing and trials;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nestablishment registration and product listing;\n\u2022\nlabeling and storage;\n\u2022\nmarketing, manufacturing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022\npre-market clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nservicing and post-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they recurred, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u2022\npost-market approval studies;\n\u2022\nproduct import and export; and\n\u2022\nrecalls and field-safety corrective actions.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated product or a significant modification to an existing product in the United States, we must obtain either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, grant of a de novo classification request, or approval of a pre-market approval, or PMA, application from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a legally marketed \u201cpredicate\u201d device (in most cases Class II devices, with a few exceptions), with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Class III devices approved under the PMA process cannot serve as predicates. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the de novo process, the FDA must determine that general and special controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device, which is low to moderate risk and has no predicate (in other words, the applicant must justify the \u201cdown-classification\u201d to Class I or II for a new product type that would otherwise automatically be placed into Class III, but is lower risk). The PMA process requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The 510(k), de novo, and PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy and require the payment of significant fees, unless an exemption applies. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from 3 to 12 months, but may take longer. The FDA\u2019s stated goal is to review de novo classification requests within 150 days, 50% of the time, but in reality the process for many applicants generally takes even longer, up to a year or more. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances, approvals, and emergency use\nauthorization to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances, approvals, or authorizations on a timely basis, or at all for our proposed products.\nIf the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for marketing authorization of the BreathTest-1000 or future modifications to the BreathTest-1000 than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline or to not increase in line with our forecasts. In addition, the FDA may determine that future products will require the more costly, lengthy and uncertain PMA process. Although we do not market any devices under PMA, the FDA may demand that we obtain a PMA prior to marketing certain of our future products. Further, even with respect to those future products where a PMA is not required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the 510(k) clearances with respect to those products.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance, approval, or authorization of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for their intended users;\n\u2022\nthe data from our clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance, approval, or authorization; and\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development. Any delay in, or failure to obtain or maintain, clearance or approval for our products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some customers from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our product. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as fines, civil penalties, injunctions, warning letters, recalls of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant future clearances or approvals, and the suspension or withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals by the FDA or other regulators. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, any operations or product applications outside of the United States will subject us to various additional regulatory and legal requirements under the applicable laws and regulations of the\ninternational markets we enter. These additional regulatory requirements may involve significant costs and expenditures and, if we are not able to comply with any such requirements, our international expansion and business could be significantly harmed.\nFailure to obtain clearance or authorization for the BreathTest-1000, or other delays in the development of the BreathTest-1000, would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nCommercialization of the BreathTest-1000 may require an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification submission, or authorization of a de novo submission. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA clearance of a 510(k), authorization of a de novo submission, or EUA can be expensive and lengthy. The FDA\u2019s review process can take several months or longer, and we may not be able to obtain FDA clearance, de novo authorization, or Emergency use Authorization for the BreathTest-1000 on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA\u2019s refusal of, or any significant delays in receiving 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or Emergency use Authorization of the BreathTest-1000, would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business. Thus far, we have not performed any clinical testing of the BreathTest-1000, which will likely be required before the device can be marketed. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance, approval, or authorization. In addition, any other delays in the development of the BreathTest-1000, for example, unforeseen issues during product validation, would have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the BreathTest-1000.\nFDA\u2019s policy with respect to Emergency Use Authorizations is evolving and may limit the ability for medical products, including the BreathTest-1000, to be eligible for commercialization under an Emergency Use Authorization.\nWe intend to submit an application with the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the BreathTest-1000. The FDA has the authority to grant an Emergency Use Authorization to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved and\navailable alternatives. If we are granted an Emergency Use Authorization for the BreathTest-1000 for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we would be able to commercialize the BreathTest-1000 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 prior to FDA clearance or authorization of a 510(k) or de novo submission, respectively. However, the FDA does not have review deadlines with respect to such submissions and, therefore, the timing of any approval of an EUA submission is uncertain. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will review our data in a timely manner, or that the FDA will accept the data when reviewed. The FDA may decide that our data are insufficient for an EUA and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies and refuse to approve our application. In addition, the FDA may revoke an Emergency Use Authorization where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, and we cannot predict how long, if ever, an Emergency Use Authorization would remain in place. Further, the FDA\u2019s policy with respect to EUAs related to COVID-19 is continuously evolving and may in the future limit the ability for medical products, including the BreathTest-1000, to be eligible for an EUA. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining an EUA for the BreathTest-1000 in a timely manner or at all, or if any granted EUA is revoked after a short period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nModifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances, de novo submissions, or pre-market approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a de novo or PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, and provides some guidance on decision making, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision at any time. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, de novo submissions or PMAs for modifications to our previously cleared or approved products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nIf we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations or fail to adequately, timely, or sufficiently respond to an FDA Form 483 or subsequent Warning Letter, this could impair our ability to market our products in a cost-effective and timely manner and could result in FDA enforcement action.\nWe and our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our product. The FDA audits compliance with the QSR, cGMP and related regulations through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The FDA may conduct these inspections or audits at any time. If, during the inspection, FDA identifies issues which, in FDA\u2019s judgment, may constitute violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or FDA\u2019s regulations, the FDA inspector may issue an FDA Form 483 listing these observations.\nNote that if an entity does not address observations found in an FDA Form 483 to FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the FDA could take enforcement action, including any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our product;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export approval for our product; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nA recall of our product, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our product, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA has the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health.\nManufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nFurther, under the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting, or MDR regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales as well as face significant adverse publicity or regulatory consequences, which could harm our business, including our ability to market our products in the future.\nAny adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or regulatory agency action, which could include inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe may be liable if the FDA or other U.S. enforcement agencies determine we have engaged in the off-label promotion of our products or have disseminated false or misleading labeling or promotional materials.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations prohibiting marketing claims that promote the off-label use of our products or that make false or misleading statements. Healthcare providers may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. FDA also could conclude that a performance claim is misleading if it determines that there are inadequate non-clinical and/or clinical data supporting the claim. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training promote of an off-label use or make false or misleading claims, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fines and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they determine that our promotional or training materials promote an unapproved use or make false or misleading claims, which could result in significant fines or penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products or false or misleading, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree. Violations of the FDCA may also lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws, which may lead to costly penalties and may adversely impact our business. Recent court decisions have impacted FDA\u2019s enforcement activity regarding off-label promotion in light of First Amendment Considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area, in part due to the potential for False Claims Act exposure. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain reimbursement for our products or regulatory clearance or approval of our future products, and to produce, market and distribute those products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nRecent political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. Both the federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. Such legislation and regulations may result in decreased reimbursement for our product, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for our product. This could harm our ability to market our products and generate sales. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our current products and future products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would negatively impact our long-term business strategy.\nIn the U.S., there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that restrict or regulate post-approval activities, which may affect our ability to profitably sell product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Such government-adopted reform measures may adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from third-party payors.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in healthcare reform laws.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d) imposed, among other things, an excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States. Under these provisions, the Congressional Research Service predicted that the total cost to the medical device industry may be up to $20 billion over a decade. The Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations implementing the tax in December 2012, which required, among other things, bi-monthly payments and quarterly reporting. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law in December 2015, included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. A second two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax was signed into law in January 2018 as part of the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (Pub. L. 115-120), extending the moratorium through December 31, 2019. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law a permanent repeal of the medical device tax under the PPACA, but there is no guarantee that Congress or the President will not reverse course in the future. If such an excise tax on sales of our products in the United States is enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 82747, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "ASTC"}
