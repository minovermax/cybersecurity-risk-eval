{"cik": "1517228", "company": "CommScope Holding Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nBNS Acquisition Risks\nIntegration of the BNS business (the Acquired Business) into our business will be difficult, costly and time-consuming and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the BNS Acquisition (the Acquisition) may take longer to realize or may not be realized at all.\nWe currently expect to realize annual cost savings of at least $175 million within three years of the closing of the Acquisition. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the Acquired Business into our business, or if such integration is successfully accomplished, that such integration will not be more costly or take longer than presently contemplated. If we cannot successfully integrate and manage the Acquired Business within a reasonable time following the Acquisition, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nOur ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties could adversely impact our business, results of operation and financial condition and include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to complete the timely integration of operations and information technology systems, organizations, standards, controls, procedures, policies and technologies, as well as the harmonization of differences in the business cultures of legacy CommScope and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nour ability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns of both our business and the Acquired Business during the process of integrating legacy CommScope and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain the service of senior management and other key personnel of both legacy CommScope and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nour ability to preserve important customer, supplier and other relationships of both legacy CommScope and the Acquired Business and resolve potential conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Acquired Business may have liabilities that we failed to or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence;\n\u2022\nthe risk that integrating the Acquired Business into the legacy CommScope business may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe risk that integrating the Acquired Business\u2019 workforce into the legacy CommScope workforce may result in production disruptions or be more costly than anticipated;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; and\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined business.\nWe are relying on TE Connectivity (TE) to provide a wide range of services required to operate the Acquired Business under Transition Services Agreements (TSAs) and such reliance is expected to continue for an extended period.\nDue to the high level of integration of the Acquired Business with the remainder of TE\u2019s business, it will be highly complex and time-consuming to separate the Acquired Business to effectively integrate it into our business. As a result, we will be dependent on TE to continue to perform elements of such critical functions as information technology, finance, logistics, human resources and operations for parts or all of the Acquired Business under TSAs. It may be up to several years before we are able to assume all of these functions and discontinue the TSAs.\nWhile operating under these TSAs, we are exposed to various risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncosts of operating the Acquired Business may be greater than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nservices provided under TSAs may not meet our requirements in a timely and effective manner;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to make operational changes or to get information necessary to realize the anticipated synergies while we are operating under the TSAs;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting while operating under the TSAs; and\n\u2022\nwe may need to operate under the TSAs for longer than expected.\nCompetitive Risks\nOur business is dependent on capital spending on data and communication networks by customers or end users of our products and reductions in such capital spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on customers\u2019 or end users\u2019 capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading data and communication networks, which can be volatile or hard to forecast. Capital spending in the communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the amount of capital spending, and, therefore, our sales and earnings, including: competing technologies; general economic conditions; seasonality of our industry; timing and adoption of global rollout of new technologies; customer specific financial or general market conditions; availability and cost of capital; governmental regulation; demands for network services; competitive pressures, including pricing pressures; acceptance of new services offered by our customers; impact of industry consolidation; and real or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales in the future, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from a limited number of key customers and channel partners.\nWe derived 24% of our 2015 consolidated net sales from our top three direct customers and channel partners, defined as distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers. Our largest distributor, Anixter International Inc., accounted for 12% of our 2015 consolidated net sales. The concentration of our net sales among these and other key customers and channel partners subjects us to a variety of risks that could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nlower sales resulting from the loss of one or more of our key customers or channel partners;\n\u2022\nrenegotiations of agreements with key customers or channel partners resulting in materially less favorable terms;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties experienced by one or more of our key customers, channel partners or our channel partners\u2019 end customers, resulting in reduced purchases of our products and/or uncollectible accounts receivable balances;\n\u2022\nreductions in inventory levels held by channel partners and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) which may be unrelated to purchasing trends by the ultimate customer;\n\u2022\nconsolidations in the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries or other key end user markets resulting in delays in purchasing decisions or reduced purchases by the merged businesses;\n\u2022\nnew or proposed laws or regulations affecting the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries or other key end user markets resulting in reduced capital spending;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of borrowing or capital and/or reductions in the amount of debt or equity capital available to the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries or other key end user markets resulting in reduced capital spending; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the technology deployed by customers resulting in lower sales of our products.\nAdditionally, the risks above may be further increased to the extent that we have significant indirect sales to one or more end users of our products (who may also be direct customers) with such indirect sales taking place through numerous channel partners and/or OEMs.\nWe generally have no minimum purchase commitments from any of our channel partners, OEMs, or other customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers and end users of our products, and any significant reduction in sales to these customers and end users of our products, including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue purchasing our products, or their failure to properly manage their businesses with respect to the purchase of and payment for our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face competitive pressures with respect to all of our major products.\nIn each of our major product groups, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies, some of which have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources or lower operating costs. They may also have broader product lines and market focus. This gives many of these enterprises a competitive advantage to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets.\nCompetitors\u2019 actions, such as price reductions or introduction of new innovative products, and the use of exclusively price driven Internet auctions by customers have caused in the past and may cause us to lose sales opportunities in the future. Some competitors may also be able to bundle their products together to meet the needs of a particular customer, and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide which will cause us to lose sales opportunities. In addition, many of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have and, therefore, have more long-standing and established relationships with certain domestic and foreign customers, making it difficult for us to sell to those customers. The rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors. We cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. These lost opportunities could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nIf any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies were to become the industry standard, our business could be seriously harmed. If our competitors are successful in bringing their products to market earlier than we can, or if their products are more technologically capable than ours, our revenue could be materially and adversely affected. Consolidation among our competitors could result in competitors with a broader market presence and could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to compete in any of our markets at the same level as we have in the past or are forced to reduce the prices of our products in order to continue to be competitive, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges to the regulatory environment in which our customers operate may negatively impact our business.\nThe telecommunications and cable television industries are subject to significant and changing federal and state regulation, both in the U.S. and other countries, including regulations regarding the \u201cOpen Internet\u201d or \u201cnet neutrality\u201d. Changes to the way in which internet service providers are regulated could adversely impact our customers\u2019 decisions regarding capital spending, which could decrease demand for our products.\nOperational Risks\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate and to adapt to technological changes and develop, implement and market product innovations.\nMany of our markets are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities that require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. These advances require ongoing improvements in the capabilities of our products.\nHowever, we may not be successful in our ongoing improvement efforts if, among other things, our products are not cost effective; brought to market in a timely manner; compliant with evolving industry standards; accepted in the market or recognized as meeting customer requirements. If we are not successful in our ongoing improvement efforts, these failures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSpecific to our business, our revenues are dependent on the commercial deployment of technologies based on 2G, 3G and 4G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on these technologies. Our business may be harmed, and our investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return if there are delays in the commercial deployment of these technologies or if these technologies are displaced by other technologies.\nIf our products, including material purchased from our suppliers, experience quality or performance issues, our business may suffer.\nOur business depends on delivering products of consistently high quality. To this end, our products are tested for quality both by us and our customers. Nevertheless, many of our products are highly complex and testing procedures used by us and our customers are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, once deployed our products may fail to perform as expected. Performance issues could result from faulty design, faulty raw materials purchased from suppliers, problems in manufacturing or installation errors. We have experienced such performance issues in the past and remain exposed to such performance issues. In some cases, recall of some or all affected products, product redesigns or additional capital expenditures may be required to correct a defect. In addition, we generally offer warranties on most products, the terms and conditions of which depend upon the product subject to the warranty. In some cases, we indemnify our customers against damages or losses that might arise from certain claims relating to our products. Future claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any significant or systemic product failure could also result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products, as well as reputational damage.\nOur business depends on effective information management systems.\nWe rely on effective information management systems for critical business operations, for strategic business decisions and to maintain a competitive edge in the market place. We rely on our enterprise resource planning systems to support such critical business operations as processing sales orders and invoicing; manufacturing; shipping; inventory control; purchasing and supply chain management; human resources; and financial reporting. We also rely on information management systems to produce information for business decision-making and to\nsupport e-commerce activities. If we are unable to successfully implement major systems initiatives, including the integration of the BNS business into our legacy CommScope systems and investing in our digital platform to accommodate the changing buying habits of our customers, and the maintenance of such critical information systems, we could encounter difficulties that could have a material adverse impact on our business, internal controls over financial reporting, or our ability to timely and accurately report our financial results.\nCyber-security incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses, could harm our business by exposing us to various liabilities, disrupting our delivery of products and services and damaging our reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate our business. We receive, process, store and transmit, often electronically, confidential data of the Company and our customers, vendors, employees and others. Despite implemented security measures, our facilities, systems and procedures, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, software viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. In particular, unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or improper disclosure of confidential or sensitive information, the deletion or modification of records or interruptions in our operations. Any such events, including those involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential or sensitive information of the Company or our customers, vendors, employees or others, whether by us or a third party, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties; expose us to liabilities to our customers, employees, vendors, third parties or governmental authorities; disrupt our delivery of products and services; and have a negative impact on our reputation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our integrated global manufacturing operations suffer production or shipping delays, we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe internally produce, both domestically and internationally, a portion of certain components used in our finished products. Disruption of our ability to produce at or distribute from these facilities due to failure of our manufacturing infrastructure, information technology outage, fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, acts of terrorism, shipping interruptions or some other catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products at our other manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective and timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we encounter capacity constraints with respect to our internal facilities and/or existing or new contract manufacturers, it could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If we do not have sufficient production capacity, either through our internal facilities or independent contract manufacturers, to meet customer demand for our products, we may experience lost sales opportunities and customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSupply Chain Risks\nOur dependence on commodities subjects us to cost volatility and potential availability constraints, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price and availability of certain raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. The principal raw materials we purchase are rods, tapes, sheets, wires, tubes and hardware made of copper, steel, aluminum or brass; plastics and other polymers; and optical fiber. Fabricated copper, steel and aluminum are used in the production of coaxial and twisted pair\ncables and polymers are used to insulate and protect cables. Prices for copper, steel, aluminum, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers, derived from oil and natural gas, have experienced significant volatility as a result of changes in the levels of global demand, supply disruptions and other factors. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. Delays in implementing price increases or a failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In an environment of falling commodities prices, we may be unable to sell higher-cost inventory before implementing price decreases, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for certain raw materials and components.\nFor certain of our raw material and component purchases, including certain polymers, copper rod, copper and aluminum tapes, fine aluminum wire, steel wire, optical fiber, circuit boards and other electronic components, we are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers.\nOur key suppliers have in the past experienced and could in the future experience production, operational or financial difficulties, or there may be global shortages of the raw materials or components we use, and our inability to find sources of supply on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective way which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and results of operations.\nIf contract manufacturers that we rely on encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If our contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, including labor disturbances or geopolitical risks, and if alternative suppliers cannot be identified, we may encounter difficulty in meeting customer demands. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of operations, which could be material.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may not fully realize anticipated benefits from past or future acquisitions or equity investments.\nWe anticipate that a portion of any future growth of our business might be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses, products or technologies. Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of our past or future acquisitions and equity investments, we cannot predict whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved. There are significant challenges to integrating an acquired operation into our business, including, but not limited to: successfully managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; integrating the sales organizations and maintaining and increasing the customer base; retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors; integrating management information, inventory, accounting and research and development activities; and addressing operating losses that may exist related to individual facilities or product lines. Further, many acquisitions involve new or developing technologies that may not achieve the expected results.\nIn addition, we might not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. We might spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or investment targets but not complete the transaction.\nAny future acquisition could involve other risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses, issuances of debt, incurrence of transaction costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and such acquisition may be dilutive to our financial results. See \u201cRisks Related to the BNS Acquisition\u201d for details related to that acquisition.\nWe may sell or discontinue one or more of our product lines, as a result of our evaluation of our products and markets.\nWe periodically evaluate our various product lines and may, as a result, consider the divestiture or discontinuance of one or more of those product lines. Any such divestiture or discontinuance could adversely affect our expenses, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDivestitures of product lines have inherent risks, including the expense of selling the product line, the possibility that any anticipated sale will not occur, possible delays in closing any sale, the risk of lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of the divested business, unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our information technology and other operating systems, and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. Expected cost savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested or discontinued businesses, may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to a fixed cost structure, and we may experience varying success in reducing fixed costs or transferring liabilities previously associated with the divested or discontinued business.\nDifficulties may be encountered in the realignment of manufacturing capacity and capabilities among our global manufacturing facilities that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products.\nWe periodically realign manufacturing capacity among our global facilities in order to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to strengthen our long-term competitive position. The implementation of these initiatives may include significant shifts of production capacity among facilities.\nThere are significant risks inherent in the implementation of these initiatives, including, but not limited to, failing to ensure that: there is adequate inventory on hand or production capacity to meet customer demand while capacity is being shifted among facilities; there is no decrease in product quality as a result of shifting capacity; adequate raw material and other service providers are available to meet the needs at the new production locations; equipment can be successfully removed, transported and re-installed; and adequate supervisory, production and support personnel are available to accommodate the shifted production.\nIn the event that manufacturing realignment initiatives are not successfully implemented, we could experience lost future sales and increased operating costs as well as customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to undertake additional restructuring actions in the future.\nWe have previously recognized restructuring charges in response to slowdowns in demand for our products and in conjunction with implementation of initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency of our operations. Recent actions have included BNS integration actions, the sale of certain assets of our BiMetals\u00ae business and the closure of domestic and international manufacturing facilities. Much of the production capacity from these facilities was shifted to other existing facilities or contract manufacturers. Restructuring actions as a result of the Acquisition are expected to continue and may be material. As a result of other changes in business conditions and other developments, we may need to initiate additional restructuring actions that could result in workforce reductions and restructuring charges, which could be material.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $5.3 billion of indebtedness on a consolidated basis, including $1.5 billion of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes), $650.0 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021\n(the 2021 Notes), $650.0 million of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes), $536.6 million of 6.625%/7.375% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2020 (the senior PIK toggle notes), $500.0 million of 4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and $1.5 billion of senior secured term loans. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and approximately $278.2 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, reflecting a borrowing base of $299.6 million and $21.4 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility depends, in part, on inventory, accounts receivable and other assets that fluctuate from time to time and may further depend on lenders\u2019 discretionary ability to impose reserves and availability blocks and to recharacterize assets that might otherwise incrementally decrease borrowing availability.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our annual cash flow for the next several years to the payment of interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as, over the term of our debt, the interest cost on a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022\nhinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses.\nIn addition, the indentures governing the senior PIK toggle notes, the 2021 Notes, the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes (together, the Notes Indentures) and the agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although the Notes Indentures and the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness.\nIn addition, if new debt is added to our and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt levels or we bought back stock or paid dividends, the risks that we face as a result of our leverage would increase.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur operations are conducted through our global subsidiaries and our ability to make cash payments on our indebtedness will depend on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. The terms of the\ninstruments governing our indebtedness significantly restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities or transfer sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may need to recognize additional impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets.\nWe have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets. We are required to test goodwill for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.\nIf, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An impairment charge would be determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant variability in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate.\nWe have a large and complex international tax profile and a significant level of foreign tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. and other carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities, repatriation of earnings from foreign affiliates, changes in tax laws, identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties and the inability to realize foreign tax credits and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets, among other matters, may significantly impact our effective income tax rate in the future. A significant increase in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nLabor Related Risks\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key employees.\nOur business depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees, including our sales force, at our operations around the world. Competition for skilled personnel and highly qualified managers in the\nindustries in which we operate is intense. Difficulties in obtaining or retaining employees with the necessary management, technical and financial skills needed to achieve our business objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nLabor unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile none of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, a significant part of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers\u2019 councils or similar statutory arrangements. In addition, many of our direct and indirect customers and vendors have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or vendors, contract manufacturers or other suppliers could result in slowdowns. Organizations responsible for shipping our products may also be impacted by strikes. Any interruption in the delivery of our products could harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products or increase costs and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn general, we consider our labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. However, in the future we may be subject to labor unrest with respect to our employees or those of our vendors or customers. Occurrences of strikes, work stoppages or lock-outs at our facilities or at the facilities of our vendors or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have obligations under our defined benefit employee benefit plans and may be required to make plan contributions in excess of current estimates.\nAt December 31, 2015, our net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits was $26.6 million (benefit obligations of $379.8 million and plan assets of $353.2 million). See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant declines in the assets and/or increases in the liabilities related to these obligations as a result of changes in actuarial estimates, asset performance, interest rates or benefit changes, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and/or results of operations.\nThe amounts and timing of the contributions we expect to make to our defined benefit plans reflect a number of actuarial and other estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected plan funding obligations. The actual amounts and timing of these contributions will depend upon a number of factors and the actual amounts and timing of our future plan funding contributions may differ materially from those presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we elect to terminate one or more of these plans and settle the obligation through the purchase of one or more annuities, we could incur a charge and/or make additional contributions and such amounts could be material.\nOur financial condition may be adversely affected to the extent that we are required to make contributions to any of our defined benefit plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current projections.\nInternational Risks\nOur significant international operations expose us to economic, political and other risks.\nWe have significant international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations. We have major international manufacturing and/or distribution facilities in, among others, Australia, Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Singapore and the United Kingdom (U.K.). For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, international sales represented approximately 51%, 45% and 45%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. In general, our international sales have lower margins than our domestic sales. To the extent international sales represent a greater percentage of our revenue, our overall margin may decline.\nOur international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to the risks inherent in operating abroad, including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rates; economic and political destabilization; restrictive actions by foreign governments; wage inflation; nationalizations; the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting trade, exports, imports, anti-bribery, foreign investment and loans; foreign tax laws, including the ability to recover amounts paid as value-added taxes; potential restrictions on the repatriation of cash; reduced protection of intellectual property; longer customer payment cycles; compliance with local laws and regulations; armed conflict; terrorism; shipping interruptions; and major health concerns (such as infectious diseases).\nRisks related to foreign currency rates can impact our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. We manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts. There can be no assurance that our risk management strategies will be effective or that the counterparties to our derivative contracts will be able to perform. In addition, foreign currency rates in many of the countries in which we operate have at times been extremely volatile and unpredictable. We may choose not to hedge or determine that we are unable to effectively hedge the risks associated with this volatility. In such cases, we may experience declines in sales and adverse impacts on earnings and such changes could be material.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from improperly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. We are also subject to the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of our activities in these locations, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and such effects could be material.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nCertain of our products are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign sanctions and embargos. If we were to fail to comply with applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us and incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import\nprivileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such effects could be material.\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks\nWe may incur costs and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and in defending claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others.\nWe may encounter difficulties and significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand our business. Other companies, including some of our largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in our industry and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products unless we secure necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn addition, we have been required, and may be required in the future, to initiate litigation in order to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. We also have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, including against certain of the products or intellectual property that we have acquired through acquisitions. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using proprietary third party technology and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain markets, we may be required to address counterfeit versions of our products. We may incur significant costs in pursuing the originators of such counterfeit products and, if we are unsuccessful in eliminating them from the market, we may experience a reduction in the value of our products and/or a reduction in our net sales.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, we are or may be subject to laws and regulations regarding the types of substances allowable in certain of our products and the handling of our products at the end of their useful life. Because of the nature of our business, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with or liability under these environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation or discharge requirements, could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the European Union has issued Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2012/19/EU\n(WEEE) regulating the manufacture, use and disposal of electrical goods and chemicals. If we do not comply with these and similar laws in other jurisdictions or to sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased cost of compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEfforts to regulate emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide, are underway in the U.S. and other countries which could increase the cost of raw materials, production processes and transportation of our products. If we are unable to comply with such regulations or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased costs of compliance, GHG regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict and in some circumstances joint and several liability (that could result in an entity paying more than its fair share) on current or former owners or operators of a contaminated property, as well as companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a contaminated property, for the costs of investigation and remediation of the contaminated property. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years and over that time, in the course of those operations, hazardous substances and wastes have been used, generated and disposed of at such facilities and investigation and remediation projects are underway at a few of these sites. There can be no assurance that the contractual indemnifications we have received from prior owners and operators of certain of these facilities will continue to be honored. In addition, we have disposed of waste products either directly or through third parties at numerous disposal sites, and from time to time we have been and may be held responsible for investigation and clean-up costs at these sites where those owners and operators have been unable to remain in business. Also, there can be no guarantee that new environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement or the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which could be material.\nShareholder Equity Risks\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price.\nWe or Carlyle may sell additional shares of common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including sales that may occur pursuant to Carlyle\u2019s registration rights and shares that may be issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market prices for our common stock. Future changes in the level of Carlyle ownership could, depending on the timing of such changes, have an adverse effect on our ability to utilize various tax attributes.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of investors to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to reduce indebtedness and fund our growth. Therefore, the success of an investment of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value, and there can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value. The payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. In addition, the Notes Indentures and the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities also effectively limit our ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not otherwise be able to pay dividends on our common stock.\nCarlyle may exercise substantial influence over us and Carlyle\u2019s interests in our business may be different than yours.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Carlyle owned approximately 32% of our common stock and is able to exercise substantial influence on our affairs. Carlyle has designated a majority of the members of our Board of Directors.\nAs a result, Carlyle or its designees to the Board of Directors may have substantial influence on our management decisions, the entering into of merger, acquisition or divestiture transactions and other extraordinary transactions. They may also influence amendments to our certificate of incorporation. So long as Carlyle continues to own a significant percentage of our common stock and/or is affiliated with members of our Board of Directors, they will have substantial influence on the vote in any election of directors and whether to consummate transactions that require stockholder approval. In any of these matters, the interests of Carlyle may differ from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock of a company with a significant stockholder or anticipate further sales of shares by Carlyle.\nIn addition, Carlyle is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential customers.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize 1,300,000,000 shares of common stock, which, to the extent unissued, could be issued without stockholder approval by the Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance, without stockholder approval, of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ngrant to the Board of Directors the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors only \u201cfor cause\u201d and require any such removal to be approved by holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; establish advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, with three staggered terms; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws and certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company and may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire.", "PERMNO": 14239, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "COMM"}
