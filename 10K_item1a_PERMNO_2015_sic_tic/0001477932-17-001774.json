Risk Factors\nCautionary Statements and Risk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are important risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations, business and financial condition to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have experienced significant and continuing losses from operations which could impede the process of raising capital.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had inadequate revenues and incurred net loss attributable to Debt Resolve, Inc. of $1,778,178 and $778,427, respectively. Cash used in operating activities for operations was $3,775,802 and $1,060,362 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nHowever, on a cash flow basis, operating results for the fourth quarter of 2016 and first two months of 2017 have been cash flow positive. Further, our ability to run our business has been greatly enhanced by the Student loan Care operating results. In addition, as can be seen from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (F-7), in the year ending December 31, 2016, we had a net increase in cash/cash equivalents of $562,621. And we reduced our reliance on debt funding in the year ending December 31, 2016 to $635,781 as compared to $1,010,393 in the year ending December 31, 2015. Based upon projected operating expenses, while we understand our working capital as of April 17, 2017 may not be sufficient to fund our plan of operations for the next 12 months, we believe that our current operations will be able to generate enough cash to meet our operating needs.\nIf this were to change, any continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that we will prove successful. We have raised capital for our day-to-day operations since our inception in January 2003; however, no assurance can be provided that we will continue to be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds secured will be sufficient to enable us to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that we are unsuccessful, we may need to curtail our operations and implement a plan to extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. At any time until substantial capital is raised, there is also a significant risk of bankruptcy. There can be no assurance that any plan to raise additional funding will be successful. The financial statements contained in this filing do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe may rely heavily on the financial success of Student Loan Care LLC.\nGoing forward, we expect a large part of our revenue to come from our new subsidiary, Student loan Care LLC. While we have over two years of experience in the federal student loan document preparation sector, our business partners have 5 years of experience in this sector. We are relying heavily on their expertise, systems and guidance to manage this new business. However, there is substantial risk to this endeavor even though adequate revenue has been established for it to be profitable. the full recourse loan portfolio created by the financing payment option has no historical experience to indicate what the future default rate may be. A high level of client defaults may not be adequately covered by the loan portfolio reserve account and the current provision for bad debt.\nAs discussed earlier in \u201cOur Business Growth Strategy\u201d section, additional joint venture businesses will be created to mitigate the financial impact on the Company from these potential issues.\nPotential conflicts of interest exist with respect to the intellectual property rights that we license from our co-founders, and it is possible our interests and their interests may diverge.\nWe do not hold patents on our consumer debt-related product, but rather license technology for our Debt Resolve Solution and our Settl.it product from the co-founders of our company, whose patented technology is now, and is anticipated to continue to be, incorporated into the Debt Resolve Solution as a key component. This license agreement presents the possibility of a conflict of interest in the event that issues arise with respect to the licensed intellectual property rights, including the prosecution or defense of intellectual property infringement actions, where our interests may diverge from those of the co-founders. The license agreement provides that we will have the right to control and defend or prosecute, as the case may require, the patent rights licensed to us subject, in the case of pleadings and settlements, to the reasonable consent of the co-founders. Our interests with respect to such pleadings and settlements may be at odds with those of the co-founders.\nOur auditors have issued a Going Concern Statement.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we incurred a net loss attributable to Debt Resolve, Inc. of $1,778,178 and $778,427 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, we have negative working capital (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) of $10,955,052 as of December 31, 2016. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur continued existence is dependent upon management's ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have issued preferred stock convertible to common stock that may have the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests and impairing their voting rights, and provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interests of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders.\nOn May 2, 2014, our board of directors designated 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Convertible Stock (\"Series A\") with a $0.001 par value. The Series A preferred stock ranks senior to common stock and all other preferred stock, and equal or junior to any preferred stock that may be issued in regard to liquidation; is not entitled to dividends and is convertible, at the holders' option, at 10 shares of common stock for each share of Series A preferred stock. On July 2, 2015, we issued 47,500 shares of Series A preferred stock for services rendered. In 2016, all previously issued Series A was converted to common stock. In 2014, we issued an aggregate of 414,500 warrants to purchase Series A preferred stock for services rendered and a debt obligation, with exercise prices ranging from $0.50 to $1.50 per share, expiring three years from the date of issuance. In 2015, we issued an aggregate of 705,000 warrants to purchase Series A preferred stock for services rendered , with exercise prices ranging from $0.50 to $1.50 per share, expiring three years from the date of issuance. In 2016, we issued an aggregate of warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of Series A preferred stock for services rendered, with exercise price of $1.50 per share, expiring three years from the date of issuance.\nIn connection with entering into the Progress Advocates LLC joint venture with LSH, LLC, we issued to LSH, LLC two five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The first warrant for 1,000,000 shares preferred stock vests and becomes exercisable 25% upon issuance and the balance upon the achievement by Progress Advocates of specific increasing revenue goals. As of December 30, 2015, these revenue goals have been achieved and these warrants have vested. The second warrant for 500,000 shares of preferred stock vests and becomes exercisable when Progress Advocates achieves at least $1,000,000 in cumulative \"operating income.\" A third five year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of Series A preferred stock was issued in October 2015 based upon Progress Advocates achievement of six months of positive operating income.\nDelaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Specifically, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe ability of our solution's clients to recover and enforce defaulted consumer debt may be limited under federal, state, local and foreign laws, which would negatively impact our revenues.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws may limit our creditor clients' ability to recover and enforce defaulted consumer debt. Additional consumer protection and privacy protection laws may be enacted that would impose additional requirements on the enforcement and collection of consumer debt. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is actively looking at the debt collection industry for new regulation. Any new laws, rules or regulations that may be adopted, as well as existing consumer protection and privacy protection laws, may adversely affect our ability to settle defaulted consumer debt accounts on behalf of our clients and could result in decreased revenues to us. We cannot predict if or how any future legislation would impact our business or our clients. In addition, we cannot predict how foreign laws will impact our ability to expand our business internationally or the cost of such expansion. Our failure to comply with any current or future applicable laws or regulations could limit our ability to settle defaulted consumer debt claims on behalf of our clients, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nChanges in Federal laws and regulations may limit Student Loan Care LLC\u2019s ability to offer document preparation services for the modification and consolidation of U.S. student loans. We cannot predict if the current government programs allowing these modifications will continue to be offered by the U.S. Department of Education in similar form or substance to the current offering upon which Student Loan Care offers its services.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses, which as a smaller public company may be disproportionately high.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for small capitalization companies like us. These new and changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards will likely result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nA poor performance by the economy may adversely impact our business.\nWhen economic conditions deteriorated, more borrowers became delinquent on their consumer debt. However, while volumes of debt to settle have risen, borrowers have less ability in a downturn to make payment arrangements to pay their delinquent or defaulted debt. As a result, our Debt Resolve service revenues may decline, or it may be more costly to generate the same revenue levels, resulting in reduced earnings. In addition, a poor economy would put pressure on our Student Loan Care and Progress Advocates clients to maintain monthly financing payments. Thus, potentially increasing Accounts Receivable bad debt expense.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe daily trading volume of our stock varies widely.\nThe daily volume in our stock varies widely and is often limited. At this time, it is not possible to liquidate a significant position in a relatively short time period. In addition, because we are not traded on a national exchange, there may be additional restrictions on the purchase or sale of our common stock.\nOur stock price may exhibit a high degree of volatility.\nBecause our stock is traded with relatively low volume, the price can move significantly on small trading volumes. The release of positive news would be expected to move our stock price up, but we have large illiquid blocks discussed above that sell into any upward momentum. These blocks exert a downward influence or may place a temporary or long-term cap on our stock price appreciation. Over time, we would expect these blocks to be broadly sold into the market, increasing our shareholder base and trading volume and mitigating the effect of these blocks over time. While we currently do not provide sales or earnings guidance as some larger companies do, we may do so in the future, and our stock price reaction may be volatile depending on our revenue and earnings performance relative to the guidance.\nAll of our assets are subject to liens as security for indebtedness under our series D convertible notes.\nAll of our assets now owned or hereafter acquired, and all proceeds therefrom, including accounts receivable and technology, are subject to liens in favor of certain investors who purchased our series D convertible notes (see Note 9 to our Notes to Financial Statements). If we were unable to service the obligations, the lien holders could foreclose on the assets that serve as collateral. As a result, following an event of default under these obligations and enforcement against the collateral, the lien holders will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of all the pledged assets owned by us now or hereafter acquired securing the obligations owed to them before any payment is made to the holders of our common stock from the proceeds of that collateral. Additionally, the holders of the liens will receive all proceeds from any realization on the collateral or from the collateral or proceeds thereof in any insolvency proceeding, until the obligations secured by the liens are paid in full.", "PERMNO": 91569, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "DRSV"}
