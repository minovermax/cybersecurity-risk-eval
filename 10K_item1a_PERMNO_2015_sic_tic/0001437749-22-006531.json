RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to our Business and Industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our business and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 in the United States has caused illness and led to quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry, and the retail industry. A worsening or prolonged continuation of the current unfavorable economic conditions could further impact our provision and allowance for credit losses and could impact the value of certain assets that we carry on our balance sheet such as goodwill.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could cause material disruptions in the future. Although the Bank continued operating during mandated shutdowns, impacts to our business during the pandemic have included costs due to additional health and safety precautions implemented at our offices and the transition of a portion of our workforce to home locations, increases in customers' inability to make scheduled loan payments, increases in requests for forbearance and loan modifications, and an adverse effect on accounting estimates that we use to determine our provision and allowance for credit losses.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances and uncertainty regarding the duration of the pandemic and the need for mitigation measures, it is difficult to predict the full, continuing impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when COVID-19 can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be fully reopened.\nAs the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u25cf\ndemand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to sustain and grow asset and income levels\u037e\n\u25cf\nif the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income\u037e\n\u25cf\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase\u037e\n\u25cf\nour allowance for loan losses may have to be increased due to a deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers or the inability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations to us (and any related forbearances or restructurings that may be implemented), which will adversely affect our net income\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe value of securities in our investment portfolio may decline if, for example, the general economy deteriorates, inflation rates increase, credit ratings decline, the issuers\u2019 financial condition deteriorates or the liquidity for debt securities declines\u037e\n\u25cf\nmaterial decreases in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate or discontinuation of our quarterly cash dividend\u037e\n\u25cf\nwe rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us\u037e and\n\u25cf\nFDIC premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nThe majority of our assets are loans, which if not repaid would result in losses to us.\nThe Bank, like other lenders, is subject to credit risk, which is the risk of losing principal or interest due to borrowers\u2019 failure to repay loans in accordance with their terms. Underwriting and documentation controls cannot mitigate all credit risk. Accordingly, our results of operations will be directly affected by the volume and timing of loan losses, which for several reasons can vary from period to period. The risks of loan losses may be exacerbated by a downturn in the economy or the real estate market in our market areas or a rapid increase in interest rates, which could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers\u2019 ability to repay. To the extent borrowers do not timely pay our loans, the loans are placed on non-accrual status, thereby reducing interest income. Further, under these circumstances, we may be required to make an additional provision for loan and lease losses or unfunded commitments, which could negatively impact our income and capital. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \u201cAnalysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nA deterioration of national or local economic conditions could reduce our profitability.\nOur lending operations and customers are primarily located in the eastern region of Northern California and Northern Nevada. A significant downturn in the national economy or the local economy due to the real estate market, public policy decisions, agricultural commodity prices, natural disaster, fires, drought or other factors could result in a decline in the local economy in general, which could in turn negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb actual loan losses, our profitability could be reduced.\nThe risk of loan losses is inherent in the lending business. We maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon our actual losses over a relevant time period and management\u2019s assessment of all relevant qualitative factors that may cause future loss experience to differ from our historical loss experience. Although we maintain a rigorous process for determining the allowance for loan losses, we cannot be certain that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses. If our allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses, or if bank regulatory agencies require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, our earnings could be significantly and adversely impacted.\nA deterioration in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 72% of our total loan portfolio is secured by real estate, the majority of which is commercial real estate. Increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net charge-offs and increases in our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nChange in interest rates could reduce our business and profitability.\nAlthough we maintain a rigorous process for managing the impact of possible interest rate fluctuations on earnings, there is a risk that despite our efforts, our earnings could be significantly and adversely impacted by changes in interest rates.\nOur earnings depend largely upon net interest income, which is the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowed funds). The rate of interest that we earn on assets and pay on liabilities is affected principally by direct competition, and general economic conditions at the state and national level and other factors beyond our control such as actions of the FRB, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and other state and federal economic policies.\nIn a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest expense we incur on our liabilities. Likewise, in a period of falling interest rates, the interest expense we incur on our liabilities may not decrease as rapidly as the interest income we earn on our assets. Historically, our liabilities have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This creates a potential imbalance as interest rates change over time, which can create significant earnings volatility.\nIn addition, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may compress, reducing our net interest income and adversely affecting our operating results. If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to re-price downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, increasing the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates can also affect the average life of our loans. A reduction in interest rates causes increased prepayments of loans as borrowers tend to refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid loans.\nWe could be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us or our existing shareholders.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. In addition, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to the risks of drought, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic weather events or pandemics could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Most of our offices are located in California, as are most of the real and personal properties securing our loans. The areas in which we operate and lend in California and Nevada are prone to earthquakes, fires, flooding and other natural disasters. In addition to possibly sustaining damage to its own properties, if there is a major earthquake, fire, flood or other natural disaster, we face the risk that many of our borrowers may experience uninsured property losses, or sustained job interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations. Therefore, a major earthquake, fire, flood or other natural disaster in California or Nevada could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOver the past decade, California has experienced a severe drought, though drought conditions have lessened in the past few years. A significant portion of our borrowers are involved in or are dependent on the agricultural industry in California, which requires water. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of our loans were categorized as agricultural loans. As a result of the drought, there have been governmental proposals concerning the distribution or rationing of water. If the amount of water available to agriculture becomes scarcer due to drought or rationing, growers may not be able to continue to produce agricultural products profitably, which could force some out of business. Although many of our customers are not directly involved in agriculture, they could be impacted by difficulties in the agricultural industry because many jobs and businesses in our market areas are related to the production of agricultural products. Therefore, a drought could adversely impact our loan portfolio, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition from larger banks and other financial institutions.\nWe face substantial competition for deposits and loans. Competition for deposits primarily comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, thrift and loan associations, credit unions, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives. Competition for loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, thrift and loan associations and increasingly \u201cfintech\u201d lending platforms. Larger competitors with larger capital resources have substantially greater resources to invest in technology and marketing and higher lending limits than us. In addition, with greater financial resources, they may be able to offer longer maturities or lower rates. Our competitors may also provide certain products and services for their customers, such as technological solutions, trust services and international banking, that we are unable to offer or may only be able to offer indirectly through correspondent relationships. Ultimately, competition can reduce our profitability, as well as make it more difficult to increase the size of our loan portfolio and deposit base.\nOur growth strategy involves risks.\nOver the past seven years, we have completed the acquisition of Bank of Feather River, two branch purchase and assumption transactions, the establishment of a new branch office in Reno, Nevada and a loan production office in Klamath Falls, Oregon. We may engage in additional acquisition activity and open additional offices in the future to expand our markets and further our growth strategy. Acquiring other banks or branches involves various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions including difficulty in estimating the value of the business to be acquired, integrating the operations, and retaining key employees and customers. We cannot assure that future acquisitions or new offices will be successful. Further, growth may strain our administrative, managerial, financial and operational resources and increase demands on our systems and controls. If we pursue our growth strategy too aggressively or fail to attract qualified personnel, control costs or maintain asset quality, or if factors beyond management\u2019s control divert attention away from our business operations, our pursuit of growth could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU No. 2016-13 significantly changes how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren\u2019t measured at fair value through net income. On October 16, 2019, the FASB approved a proposal to change the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, delaying the effective date to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal periods.\nThe standard will replace today\u2019s \u201cincurred loss\u201d approach with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU No. 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity\u2019s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach).\nWe have started our CECL implementation efforts by establishing an implementation team chaired by our Chief Lending Officer and composed of members of our credit administration and accounting departments. We have invested in software to support the CECL calculation of the allowance for loan losses under ASU No 2016-13 and have engaged a software vendor to assist in the transition to the CECL model. During the second quarter of 2021 we engaged a consultant to perform a model validation of our CECL model and to assist us in documenting aspects of the CECL model. Our preliminary evaluations indicate that the implementation of CECL will impact our Consolidated Financial Statements, in particular the level of the reserve for credit losses. However, we will continue to evaluate the extent of the potential impact over the next several years.\nSecurity breaches and technological disruptions could damage our reputation and profitability.\nOur electronic banking activities expose us to possible liability and harm to our reputation should an unauthorized party gain access to confidential customer information. Despite our considerable efforts and investment to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data, we cannot guarantee that these precautions will protect our systems from security compromises or breaches. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to recognize and assist in preventing security breaches (and periodically test our security), a failure to protect against or mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services, constitute a breach of privacy or other laws, result in costly litigation and loss of customer relationships, negatively impact our reputation, and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also incur substantial increases in costs in an effort to minimize or mitigate cyber security risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business. Integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our technology and information systems, operational infrastructure and relationships with third parties and colleagues in day-to-day and ongoing operations. A failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope. This includes, but is not limited to, operational or systems failures, disruption of client operations and activities, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as well as the loss of key colleagues or failure on the part of key colleagues to perform properly.\nWe face risks relating to our reliance on third party vendors.\nWe outsource a large portion of our data processing to third parties who may encounter technological or other difficulties that could in turn significantly limit or affect our ability to process and account for customer transactions. These vendors provide services that support our operations, including the storage and processing of sensitive consumer and business customer data, as well as our sales efforts. A cyber security breach of a vendor\u2019s system may result in theft of our data or disruption of business processes. In most cases, we would be primarily liable to our customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor\u2019s data security system.\nWe also rely on our outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls. The loss of these vendor relationships could disrupt the services we provide to customers and cause us to incur significant expense in connection with replacing these services.\nThe Company depends primarily on the operations of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares, repay its indebtedness and fund its operations. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company depends on the success of the Bank\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiary, the Bank, and it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank. There are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to, or engage in transactions with, the Company. The Company\u2019s inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Even if applicable laws and regulations would permit the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and would permit the Company to pay dividends to our shareholders, our Board of Directors could determine that it is not in the best interest of the Company\u2019s shareholders to do so in order to preserve or redeploy our capital resources, for example. For these reasons, the amount and frequency of dividends that we pay to shareholders may vary from time to time.\nA reduction in the value, or impairment of our investment securities, can impact our earnings and common shareholders' equity.\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires that we carry our available-for-sale investment securities at fair value on our balance sheet. Unrealized gains or losses on these securities, reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost, net of its tax effect, are reported as a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. In certain instances, GAAP requires recognition through earnings of declines in the fair value of securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. Changes in the fair value of these securities may result from a number of circumstances that are beyond our control, such as changes in interest rates, the financial condition of municipalities, government sponsored enterprises or insurers of municipal bonds, changes in demand for these securities as a result of economic conditions, or reduced market liquidity. If our investment securities decline in market value and other than temporary impairments of these assets results, we would be required to recognize a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our business and prospects.\nOur reputation is an important asset. Our relationship with many of our customers is predicated upon our reputation as a high-quality provider of financial services that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Our ability to attract and retain customers, investors and employees depends upon external perceptions. Damage to our reputation among existing and potential customers, investors and employees could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, lending practices, inadequate protection of customer information, sales and marketing efforts, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees. Adverse developments in the banking industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. We have policies and procedures in place intended to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors, and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties that we may acquire.\nIf our borrowers are unable to meet their loan repayment obligations, we will initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to and may take actions to acquire title to the personal and real property that collateralized their loans. As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even though we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination. In addition, if we were the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we could be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulation of the Company and the Bank\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and may face regulatory enforcement actions, incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on our operations. Over time, our business has been increasingly affected by the growing breadth of these regulations, and this trend is likely to continue. Federal and state banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by bank holding companies and banks in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. If banking regulators determine that we have violated laws or engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, we could face enforcement actions, incur fines, penalties, and other negative consequences. While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be certain that these will be effective. We may also suffer other negative consequences resulting from findings of noncompliance with laws and regulations which may also damage our reputation, and this in turn might materially affect our business and results of operations. Further, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines, restitution, or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance.\nOur participation in the SBA PPP loan program exposes us to risks related to noncompliance with the PPP, as well as litigation risk related to our administration of the PPP loan program, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a participating lender in the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA which was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We funded 2,256 PPP loans in the aggregate principal amount of $197 million and BFR funded 562 PPP loans in the aggregate principal amount of $60 million through December 31, 2021. Under the PPP, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP. There is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. In addition, a few other financial institutions have experienced litigation related to their process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. Any financial liability, regulatory enforcement, litigation costs or reputational damage stemming from our participation in the PPP and any related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan. If the SBA identifies a deficiency, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty for the affected loan or loans, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Among the factors that could affect the trading price of our common stock are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nresearch reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nour actions or those of our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional shareholders;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock prices and operating results of other financial institutions;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nA significant decline in the trading price of our common stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nThe trading volume of our common stock is limited.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, trading volume to date has been relatively modest. The limited trading market for our common stock may lead to exaggerated fluctuations in market prices and possible market inefficiencies compared to more actively traded securities. It may also make it more difficult for investors to sell our common stock at desired prices, especially for holders seeking to dispose of a large number of shares of stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe have designed and implemented controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file with the SEC under the Exchange Act is accurately accumulated and communicated to our management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. However, no disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control systems, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, which could result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the correction or restatement of previously disclosed financial statements or information.\nWe rely on key executives and personnel and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse impact on our prospects.\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the California and Nevada community banking industry. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company\u2019s strategies is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing, compliance, and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel. In particular, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities and relationships of key executives and certain other employees.", "PERMNO": 90710, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PLBC"}
