{"cik": "1006028", "company": "PURE BIOSCIENCE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-10-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following information about risks and uncertainties that may affect us or our business, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. If any of the following events, described as risks, actually occur, either alone or taken together, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities. An investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should not invest in our securities if you cannot bear the economic risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time and cannot afford to lose your entire investment. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAs a result of our historical lack of financial liquidity, we do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations and may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of recurring losses, and as of July 31, 2017, we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately $109 million. As of July 31, 2017, we had $1,640,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $426,000 in accounts payable. In October 2017, we completed a tender offer to amend and exercise outstanding warrants held by the investors participating in our 2014, 2015 and 2017 private placement financings, resulting in our receipt of approximately $2.8 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of 4,756,163 outstanding warrants. During year ended July 31, 2017, our cash outflows for operating activities and for investments in patents and fixed assets were $4.8 million. As a result, our existing cash resources are not sufficient to meet our anticipated needs over the next twelve months from the date hereof, and we will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations and to implement our business plan, which capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf the market acceptance of, and demand for, our products;\n\u25cf the timing and costs of executing our sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully complete the in-plant validation trials requested by potential customers and our ability to convert these trials into customer orders for our products;\n\u25cf the costs and time required to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products, including the required USDA approval for use of PURE Control in OLR processing of raw poultry;\n\u25cf the extent to which we invest in new testing and product development, including in-plant optimization trials;\n\u25cf the extent to which our customers continue to place product orders as expected and expand their existing use of our products;\n\u25cf the cost and time to satisfy unique customer requirements regarding validation trials or to support the value proposition and benefits of our products;\n\u25cf the timing of vendor payments and the collection of receivables, among other factors affecting our working capital;\n\u25cf our ability to control the timing and amount of our operating expenses, including the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required to implement our business plan; and\n\u25cf the costs to file, prosecute and defend our intellectual property rights.\nThe above factors, along with our history and near term forecast of incurring net losses and negative operating cash flows, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not obtain additional capital from external sources, we will not have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations or be able to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Further, any contracts or license arrangements we enter into to raise funds may require us to relinquish our rights to our products or technology, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any such contracts or license arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. Having insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back our marketing, distribution and other commercialization activities or cease our operations altogether.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe had a loss of $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, and a loss of $14.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. As of July 31, 2017, we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately $109 million. Although we believe we are making progress on implementing our business plan focused on the food safety market, we expect to continue to have losses in future periods. None of our existing agreements, including those with Subway and Chipotle, contain provisions that guarantee us any minimum revenues. If the penetration into the marketplace of PURE Hard Surface, PURE Control and our other SDC-based products is unsuccessful, our revenue growth is slower than anticipated or our operating expenses exceed expectations, it may take an unforeseen period of time to achieve or maintain profitability, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. Slower than anticipated revenue growth could force us to reduce our sales and marketing efforts, our product testing and optimization, and our product development and regulatory initiatives, and/or force us to reduce the size and scope of our operations, to sell or license our technologies to third parties, or to cease operations altogether. Given our recent introduction of our SDC-based products in the food safety market, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when we will generate sufficient revenues to become profitable, and it is possible we will never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nWe will need to increase our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. We have a history of raising funds through offerings of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and we may in the future raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted. Additionally, any debt financing we obtain may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include, among other things, limitations on borrowing, specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens on our assets, pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock or make investments. In addition, if we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or proprietary technologies. We may be required in future collaborations to relinquish all or a portion of our sales and marketing rights with respect to our products or license intellectual property that enable licensees to develop competing products in order to complete any such transaction.\nAs of October 26, 2017, we have 78,962,800 shares of common stock issued and outstanding or reserved for issuance under equity compensation plans, vested and unvested options, warrants, and unvested restricted stock units. Our current authorized capital stock is limited to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Any increase in our authorized capital stock would require the approval of a majority of our shareholders as well as the approval of our Board of Directors. If we were unable to increase our authorized capital stock for any reason, our ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt would be severely compromised and we may be unable to obtain equity or convertible debt capital at all.\nBecause we only recently focused our business on the food safety market, it is difficult to evaluate our prospects.\nOur success will depend on our ability to increase customer awareness and adoption of our food safety product offerings, PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control. We only began focusing our business on developing and offering products that address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain in August 2013. In addition, we only recently received the required FDA and USDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce and as a spray or dip applied to raw poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing. We are still pursuing the required USDA approval for use of PURE Control in OLR processing of raw poultry. Further, we are currently working on completing in-plant validation trials to test the effectiveness of PURE Control in actual in-plant use and to optimize the application of PURE Control for poultry processing. Due to the recent introduction of our food safety products and the importance of food safety to our customers, the sales cycle to secure a new customers is long and unpredictable. We have encountered and likely will continue to encounter risks and difficulties associated with introducing or establishing new commercial products in this highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. These risks include the following, among others:\n\u25cf we may not be successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of PURE Control in actual in-plant use situations or satisfy the requirements of our potential customers;\n\u25cf we may not be successful in converting in-plant trials into customer product orders;\n\u25cf our SDC-based product offerings (especially at higher silver-ion concentrations) are typically more expensive to produce than existing treatment chemicals, and as a result, customers may not purchase our products for cost reasons, even if we are successful in demonstrating the superior efficacy or other benefits of our products;\n\u25cf our customers may not continue to place product orders as expected or may not expand their use of our products;\n\u25cf we may not be successful in demonstrating the value proposition of our products, including its non-corrosive and non-toxic characteristics and its neutral to positive processing yield impact;\n\u25cf we may not succeed in materially penetrating the food safety markets with our SDC products and technology;\n\u25cf we may not be successful in developing an effective sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our products;\n\u25cf we may not generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funds to support our operations or the implementation of our business plan;\n\u25cf we may not be successful in controlling our operating expenses;\n\u25cf we may not be successful in obtaining any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u25cf we may not attract and retain key sales and marketing, technical and management personnel;\n\u25cf we may not successfully comply with or maintain the regulatory approvals we obtain for our technology and products;\n\u25cf we may not succeed in locating strategic partners and licensees of our technology;\n\u25cf we may not effectively manage our anticipated growth, if any; and\n\u25cf we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nAny failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties could seriously harm our business and prospects.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate our future revenues and operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require us to secure additional financing sooner than planned.\nWe may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues and our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf our expectations regarding revenues from sales of our products;\n\u25cf the time and resources required to complete in-plant validation and optimization trials;\n\u25cf the time and cost of obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the cost and time to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for additional products as part of our long-term business plan;\n\u25cf the cost and time required to create effective sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization strategies;\n\u25cf the expenses we incur to maintain and improve our platform technology;\n\u25cf the cost and time to satisfy unique customer requirements regarding validation and optimization trails;\n\u25cf the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u25cf the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation.\nIn addition, our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of our products and services, and from collaborations with third parties. However, we may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues. In addition, we may not be able to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our revenues or we may increase our expenses as part of implementing our long-term business plan. As a result, a significant shortfall in our planned revenues or a significant increase in our planned expenses could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In such case, we may be required to issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into other commercial arrangements, including relationships with corporate and other partners, sooner than anticipated to secure the additional financial resources to support our development efforts and future operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nBecause of our limited operating history and the early commercial stage of our SDC-based products in the food safety market, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Forecasting future revenues is difficult, especially because our products are novel, and market acceptance of our products is reliant on our customers\u2019 confidence, based on scientific data and actual in-plant trials, that our product can improve their food safety efforts. Because food safety is such a critical factor to our customers and potential customers, we often experience long sales cycles and our customers often require extensive evaluation and in-plant trial periods before agreeing to use our products throughout their systems. In addition, fluctuations in the buying patterns of our current or potential customers could significantly affect the level of our sales on a period to period basis. Additional factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate unexpectedly, include: the mix of product sales, the cost of product sales, our ability to meet customer demand, delays in achieving our regulatory milestones, changes in our operating expenses, including non-cash expenses such as the fair value of stock options granted to our employees, and manufacturing or supply issues. As a result, our quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid will be harmed and our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw poultry and fresh produce in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. No additional approval from the USDA is required for fresh produce. In July 2016, we received a \u201cNo Objection Letter\u201d from the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. In January 2017, we submitted an additional FCN to the FDA to allow use of higher SDC concentrations in poultry processing, allowing the flexibility to adjust to varying plant and processing conditions. In May 2017, we received a Final Letter from the FDA for this FCN as well as a \u201cNo Objection Letter\u201d from the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for the higher concentrations of SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. We have not, however, received the required approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing. We are continuing our on-going plant trials to optimize the application of PURE Control, including with higher concentrations of SDC, in OLR to attempt to gain USDA approval for use in that stage of poultry processing, but there is no assurance that we will obtain such approval on a timely basis, or at all. Further, even if we elect to seek regulatory approval, there is no assurance we will be successful in obtaining the required approvals from the FDA and USDA to utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for poultry and as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meets will be restricted and our business and operating results will suffer.\nA loss of one or more of our key customers could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, one or a small number of our customers may represent a significant percentage of our revenue. Our three largest customers accounted for 62% of our net product sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017. Our two largest customers accounted for 33% and 19% of net product sales, respectively. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net product sales. Although we have agreements with many of our customers, these agreements typically do not prohibit customers from purchasing products and services from competitors or contain minimum purchase obligations. A decision by any of our major customers to significantly reduce the amount of product ordered or license fees paid, or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner, or at all, could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on our core SDC technology and if our efforts to achieve or maintain market acceptance of our core SDC technology are not successful, we are unlikely to attain profitability.\nWe have and are currently focusing substantially all of our time and financial resources in the development and commercialization of our core SDC technology to address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. Although our SDC technology has applications in multiple industries, we expect that sales of SDC and SDC-based products as a food safety solution will constitute a substantial portion, or all, of our revenues in future periods. We are marketing our SDC-based products to restaurant chains, food manufacturers, food processors and food transportation companies. Our SDC-based products have not yet been broadly accepted into the food safety market, and may never be broadly accepted. Any material decrease or significant delay in the overall level of sales or expected sales of, or the prices for, our SDC-based products, whether as a result of competition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, long sales cycles, change in customer demands or requirements, or any other factor, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain product sales or other forms of revenue over time if new products or technologies are introduced by competitors that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost-effective or otherwise render our products less attractive or obsolete.\nWe are subject to intense competition in the food safety market.\nOur SDC-based products compete in the highly competitive food safety market. Our SDC-based product offerings (especially at higher silver ion concentration levels) are typically more expensive to produce than existing treatment chemicals, and as a result, customers may not purchase our products for cost reasons, even if we are successful in demonstrating the superior efficacy of our products. In addition, customers may determine that the other benefits offered by our products (e.g., non-toxic, non-caustic, and neutral to positive yield impact) are not sufficient to overcome the lower cost products offered by our competitors. Further, most of our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time than we have, and offer a greater number of products and services than we do and have greater financial, technical, sales and other resources than we do. Many of our competitors already have well established brands and distribution capabilities, and in some cases are able to leverage the sale of other products with more favorable terms for products competing with our own. We also have significantly fewer sales personnel than virtually all of our competitors. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry are for large food safety companies to consolidate into a smaller number of very large entities, which further concentrates financial, technical and market strength and increases competitive pressure in the industry. If we directly compete with these very large entities for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent or delay us from capturing a meaningful share the food safety market. It is also possible that developments by our competitors will make our technologies or products noncompetitive or obsolete. Our ability to compete will depend upon our ability, and the ability of our distributors and other partners, to develop brand recognition, develop the scientific and plant trial data to demonstrate the efficacy of our products, and to displace existing, established and future products in our relevant target markets. We, or our distributors and partners, may not be successful in doing so, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited sales, marketing and product distribution experience.\nWe have limited experience in the sales, marketing and distribution of our products in the food safety market. We began to focus on the food safety market in August 2013. We received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce in January 2016. We received the required USDA and FDA approvals to market PURE Control for use as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry in July 2016 and May 2017, respectively We have not, however, received the required approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing, and there is no assurance we will receive USDA approval, which limits our ability to market PURE Control for poultry processing. As a result, our sales and marketing experience with these products are limited, and our current sales, distribution and marketing strategies and programs may not be successful. Further, due to the recent introduction of our food safety products and the importance of food safety to our customers, the sales cycle to secure a new customer is long and unpredictable. Potential customers typically require that we complete extensive in-plant validation studies with our products. We may not be successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of PURE Control in actual in-plant use situations or satisfy the requirements of our potential customers. Moreover, we may not be successful in converting in-plant trials into customer product orders. We also have a relatively small sales and marketing organization and a limited number of distributors. We may not be able to establish the sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities necessary to build our business and generate sufficient revenues to support our operations and the implementation of our business plan.\nWe are dependent on a third-party, over whom we have limited control, to manufacture our SDC-based products.\nIn December 2013, we entered into a five-year strategic collaboration agreement with St. Louis-based Intercon Chemical Company (\u201cICC\u201d) where we granted ICC the right to be the exclusive manufacture for all our SDC-based products. We do not have any manufacturing facilities ourselves and we currently rely on ICC to manufacture our SDC-based products and may in the future rely on one or more third-party manufacturers to properly manufacture our products. We may not be able to quickly replace our manufacturing capacity if ICC is unable to manufacturer our products as a result of a fire, natural disaster (including an earthquake), equipment failure or other difficulty, or if such ICC facilities are deemed not in compliance with current \u201cgood manufacturing practices,\u201d and the noncompliance could not be rapidly rectified. ICC is our single manufacturer for our SDC-based products and may not be replaced without significant effort and delay in production. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current manufacturer\u2019s capabilities could harm our ability to manufacturer such products until new manufacturers are identified and qualified, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business and results. Any third-party manufacturer that we find may not match our quality standards or be able to meet customer requirements.\nAdditionally, our inability or reduced capacity to have our products manufactured would prevent us from successfully evaluating or commercializing our proposed products. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver proposed products on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third parties to develop SDC-based products, and they may not do so successfully or diligently.\nWe have granted ICC and other third parties to whom we license rights to our technology certain distribution and development rights to products containing SDC for applications and markets outside the U.S. food safety market. Our reliance on ICC and other third parties for development and distribution activities reduces our control over these activities. In such arrangements, we have relied, and expect in the future to rely, on the third party to fund and direct product development activities and appropriate regulatory filings. Any of these third parties may not be able to successfully develop such SDC-based products due to, among other factors, a lack of capital, a lack of appropriate diligence, insufficient devotion to sales efforts, a change in the evaluation by the third party of the market potential for SDC-based products, technical failures, and poorer than expected results from testing or trial use of any products that may be developed. If the third parties on which we rely are not successful in such development activities, our business and operating results would be adversely affected.\nPricing and supply issues may have a material impact on our margins and our ability to supply our customers.\nAll of the supply ingredients used to manufacture our SDC-based products are available from multiple suppliers. However, commodity prices for some ingredients can vary significantly and the margins that we are able to generate could decline if prices rise. For example, both silver and citric acid prices have been volatile in recent periods.\nIn addition to such commodities, we also rely on producers of specialized packaging inputs such as bottles and labels for finished products. Due to their specialized nature, the supply of such inputs can be periodically constrained and result in additional costs to obtain these items, which may in turn inhibit our ability to supply products to our customers.\nWe are generally unable to increase our product prices to our customers, partners and distributors quickly in order to maintain our margins, and significant price increases for key inputs could therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Price increases can also result in lost sales, and any inability to supply our customers\u2019 orders can lead to lost future sales to such customers.\nWe expect ICC to be the sole source supplier of our SDC concentrate and we may use other third parties to blend, package and provide fulfillment activities for our finished products in future periods. We expect that our margins may be reduced by using ICC and other such third parties, and our ability to maintain product quality may not be as extensive or effective as when we produce these products in our own facility(ies). Any quality control issues could lead to product recalls and/or the loss of future sales, which would reduce our revenues and/or profits.\nIf we are not able to manage any growth we achieve effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nIn order to implement our business plan and achieve and maintain market acceptance of our SDC-based products, we will need to expand our business operations and hire additional sales and support personnel. We may not have sufficient resources to do so. If we hire additional personnel and invest in additional infrastructure, we may not be effective in expanding our operations and our systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support any such expansion. Failure to properly manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results.\nThe industries in which we operate are heavily regulated.\nWe are focused on the marketing and continued development of our SDC antimicrobial technology for use in the food safety market. Our existing products, PURE Control and PURE Hard Surface, and any additional products we develop based on our SDC technology in future periods, require or will require approval by government agencies prior to marketing or sale in the U.S. or in foreign markets. Complying with applicable government regulations and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals can be, and has historically been, time consuming and expensive, due in part, we believe, to the novel nature of our technology. Regulatory review could involve delays or other actions adversely affecting the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of our products. While we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any pending or future regulatory review processes or the extent or impact of any future changes to legislation or regulations affecting review processes, we expect such processes to remain time consuming and expensive as we, or our partners, apply for approval to make new or additional efficacy claims for current products or to market new product formulations. Obtaining approvals for new SDC-based products in the U.S., or in markets outside the U.S., could take several years, or may never be accomplished.\nSDC is a platform technology rather than a single use applied technology. As such, products developed from the platform may fall under the jurisdiction of multiple U.S. and international regulatory agencies. Our disinfectant and sanitizer products are regulated in the U.S. by the EPA. In addition to the EPA, each of the 50 states in the U.S. has its own government agencies that regulate the sale or shipment of our products into their state. We have obtained registration for these products from the EPA and all states into which such products are currently marketed and sold. We are required to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and pay ongoing fees in order to maintain such registrations. We may not be able to maintain these registrations in the future, which may eliminate our continued ability to market and sell our products in some or all parts of the U.S. We also may not be able to obtain necessary registrations with the EPA and applicable states for other SDC disinfectant and sanitizer products that we or our partners may develop, which would limit our ability to sell any such products in the future.\nSome potential applications of SDC, such as those aimed at healthcare, veterinary and certain food preparation markets, may require approval of other government agencies prior to marketing or sale in the U.S. or in foreign markets, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA. Obtaining FDA and/or USDA approval is a complicated and expensive process and such approvals may never be obtained for any SDC products. If FDA and/or USDA approvals are obtained, the approvals may limit the uses for which SDC products may be marketed such that they may not be profitable to us, and the applicable products would be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and/or USDA that could lead to withdrawal or limitation of any product approvals.\nFor example, in November 2014, we withdrew, without prejudice, our FCN for raw poultry due to receipt of a Deficiency Letter from the FDA stating that the agency has developed new data that is currently under review, which data calls into question the long established safety levels of the dietary intake of silver in the U.S. from food contact uses previously approved by the FDA. As a result, the FDA indicated that it would not approve our FCN absent new data or additional information that adequately addresses its new toxicity concerns. We also received a similar Deficiency Letter from the FDA for the FCN we submitted in October 2014 for the use of SDC to reduce Salmonella, E. coli and Listeria in the processing of produce. In January 2015, we withdrew, without prejudice, our produce FCN and postponed the filing of our FCN for the use of SDC as a processing aid for beef and pork. We resubmitted our poultry FCN in June 2015. In September 2015, we received an Acknowledgement Letter from the FDA stating that our FCN for SDC as a raw poultry processing aid is complete and setting an effective date of December 2015. Following the completion of additional testing demonstrating further reduction of silver residues to levels approaching non-detectable, and subsequent encouraging discussions held with the FDA, we resubmitted our produce FCN in September 2015. We received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw poultry and fresh produce in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. In July 2016, we received a \u201cNo Objection Letter\u201d from the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. In January 2017, we submitted an additional FCN to the FDA to allow use of higher SDC concentrations in poultry processing, allowing the flexibility to adjust to varying plant and processing conditions. In May 2017, we received a Final Letter from the FDA for this FCN as well as a \u201cNo Objection Letter\u201d from the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for the higher concentrations of SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. We have not, however, received the required approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing. We are continuing our on-going plant trials to optimize the application of PURE Control, including with higher concentrations of SDC, in OLR to attempt to gain USDA approval for use in that stage of poultry processing, but there is no assurance that we will obtain such approval on a timely basis, or at all. Further, even if we elect to seek regulatory approval, there is no assurance we will be successful in obtaining the required approvals from the FDA and USDA to utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for poultry and as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meets will be restricted and our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe intend to fund and manage certain of our EPA-regulated product development internally, in conjunction with engaging regulatory consultants and partnering with other third parties. We have partnered, or intend to partner, with third parties who are seeking, or intend to seek, approvals to market SDC-based products in markets outside the U.S., and with other third parties who are developing FDA-regulated SDC-based products who, upon such development, would seek FDA approvals of such products. Our ability to market and sell our products is dependent on our and our partners\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain required registrations and approvals of applicable regulatory agencies. Failure by our partners or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines or the withdrawal of approval for us or our partners and distributors to market our products in some or all jurisdictions or for certain indications, which could cause us to be unable to successfully commercialize SDC or otherwise achieve revenues from sales of such products.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, and our partners, including our third-party manufacturer, failure to comply with applicable quality standards could affect our ability to commercialize SDC products.\nThe EPA and other applicable U.S. and foreign government agencies regulate our and our partners\u2019 systems and processes, including those of ICC, for manufacturing SDC-based products. These regulations require that we and our partners observe \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. Failure by us or our partners to comply with current or future government regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages, and/or delays in product manufacturing, any or all of which could cause significant cost to us. Further, efficacy or safety concerns and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products or those of our partners could lead to product recalls, fines, withdrawal of approvals, and/or declining sales, any or all of which could result in our failure to successfully commercialize SDC or otherwise achieve revenue growth.\nIf we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety or efficacy of our products, our sales may be harmed.\nIf concerns should arise about the safety or efficacy of any of our products that are marketed, regardless of whether or not such concerns have a basis in generally accepted science or peer-reviewed scientific research, such concerns could adversely affect the market for those products. Similarly, negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not those claims are supported by applicable law.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products.\nOur manufacture, use and sale of SDC-based products may subject us to lawsuits relating to the validity and infringement of patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. If we are found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in our business and our obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. If the rights holders are willing to permit us to continue to use their intellectual property rights, it may be necessary for us to enter into license arrangements with unfavorable terms and pay substantial amounts in royalty and other license fees. Either having to cease use or pay such fees could prevent us, or our third-party manufacturer, from manufacturing and selling our products, which could make us much less competitive in our industry and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims.\nAs a business that manufactures and markets products for use by consumers and institutions, we may become liable for any damage caused by our products, whether used in the manner intended or not, including potentially damage to our customers\u2019 businesses. Regardless of merit or potential outcome, product liability claims against us may result in, among other effects, the inability to commercialize our products, impairment of our business reputation, and distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we could incur substantial liabilities. Although we maintain general and product liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims and may not be adequate to indemnify for liabilities that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our business and operating results.\nLitigation or the actions of regulatory authorities may harm our business or otherwise distract our management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur major expenditures and would distract our management. For example, lawsuits against us or our officers or directors by employees, former employees, stockholders, partners, customers, or others, or actions taken by regulatory authorities, could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Such lawsuits and actions are not uncommon, and we may not be able to resolve such disputes or actions on terms favorable to us, and there may not be sufficient capital resources available to defend such actions effectively, or at all.\nCompliance with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.\nWe are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of complying with the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, including preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, can be substantial.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, the Company\u2019s stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could harm our business and the value of the Company\u2019s common shares.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls and financial reporting are not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers that are not \u201clarge accelerated filers\u201d or \u201caccelerated filers\u201d under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting and financial processes in the future. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Furthermore, to the extent our business grows, our internal controls may become more complex, and we would require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. If we or our independent auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner.\nWe depend on key personnel for our continued operations and future success, and a loss of certain key personnel could significantly hinder our ability to move forward with our business plan.\nOur success depends largely on the execution of our business strategy by our management team and the members of our Board of Directors. Our Board and management will be evaluating how to best execute our near-term strategy to drive customer adoption in the food industry by addressing food safety solutions across the supply chain in order to prevent or mitigate food contamination or the potential for food-borne illness with specific customer focus in foodservice providers, food processors and food manufacturers. Our directors, executive officers and key personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time without notice and without penalty. Additionally, we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on our directors, executive officers or other employees. The loss of one or more of our directors, executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our ability to execute on our business strategy, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or the market price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that in such an event we would be able to recruit qualified personnel able to replace these individuals in a timely manner, or at all, on terms acceptable to either us or to any qualified candidate. Even if we were able to replace any such individuals in a timely manner, if we are unable to effectively integrate new executive officers or key employees, our operations and prospects could be harmed.\nBecause competition for highly qualified sales and marketing and management personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the employees we need to support our potential growth.\nTo successfully meet our objectives, we must attract and retain highly qualified sales and marketing and management personnel with specialized skill sets focused on the industries in which we compete, or intend to compete. Competition for qualified business development and bioengineering personnel can be intense. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. In addition, it takes time for our new personnel to become productive and to learn our business. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, it will be difficult for us to sell our products or to license our technology or to achieve or maintain regulatory approvals, and we may experience a shortfall in revenue and not achieve our anticipated, or any, growth.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time we may consider engaging in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, among others, exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses. Accordingly, although we may not choose to undertake or may not be able to successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do undertake or complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may invest or spend our cash in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return.\nOur management has considerable discretion in the use of our cash. Our cash may be used for purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. Until the cash is used, it may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value. The failure of our management to invest or spend our cash effectively could result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects, each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may not be able to utilize all, or any, of our tax net operating loss carry-forwards and our future after-tax earnings, if any, could be reduced.\nAt July 31, 2017, we had federal and state tax net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $100.3 million and $74.7 million, respectively. Utilization of these net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred, including with respect to our recent private placements, or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions (both before and after our initial public offering in 1996) which, combined with the purchasing stockholders\u2019 subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such an ownership change, or could result in an ownership change in the future based upon subsequent disposition. While we believe that we have not experienced an ownership change, the pertinent tax rules related thereto are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and thus the applicable taxing authorities may take an alternative position.\nOur current federal tax loss carry-forwards begin expiring in the year ended July 31, 2019 and, unless previously utilized, will completely expire in the year ending July 31, 2037. The balance of our current federal net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between July 31, 2019 and July 31, 2037. Our state tax loss carry-forwards begin to expire in the year ending July 31, 2018, and will completely expire in the year ending July 31, 2037. If we are unable to earn sufficient profits to utilize the carry-forwards by these dates, they will no longer be available to offset future profits, if any.\nWe are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time we may be audited by tax authorities to whom we are subject. Any assessment resulting from such audits, if any, could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain or defend the patent and other intellectual property rights relating to our technology, we or our collaborators and distributors may not be able to develop and market proprietary products based on our technology, which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright protections, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business.\nLegal protections of our intellectual property and proprietary rights afford only limited protection. For instance, we currently own twelve U.S. patents related to our SDC technology. The lives of these patents, and any patents that we may obtain in the future, are not indefinite, and the value to us of some or all of our patents may be limited by their terms. Further, although we have a number of U.S. and international patent applications pending, some or all of those applications may not result in issued patents, and the intellectual property claims therein would be unprotected. Additionally, obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on our compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. Furthermore, the patent positions of bioscience companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and, therefore, we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to ultimately enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents.\nIn addition, to the extent that we operate internationally, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many countries have a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d trademark registration system, which may prevent us from registering or using our trademarks in certain countries if third parties have previously filed applications to register or have registered the same or similar trademarks. Additionally, changes in the patent and/or trademark laws or interpretations of such laws in the U.S. or other countries could diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. Moreover, our competitors may develop competing technologies that are not covered by the claims of, and therefore do not infringe upon, our issued patents, which could render our patents less valuable to us. If our proprietary rights cannot be, or are not sufficiently, protected by patent and trademark registrations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and products.\nOur own efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may also be insufficient. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights, including without limitation through confidentiality and other similar contractual restrictions, our means of protecting such rights may not be adequate and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our proprietary technology, obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. It is possible that, despite our efforts, competitors or others will create and use products, adopt service names similar to our service names or otherwise violate or misappropriate our proprietary rights. The infringement of such rights could have a material negative impact on our business and on our results of operations.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, which would be expensive and could consume time and other resources. The result of any such litigation may be the court\u2019s ruling that our patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid and/or should not be enforced. Additionally, even if the validity of such rights is upheld, the court could refuse to stop a third party\u2019s infringing activity on the ground that such activities do not infringe our rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has recently revised certain tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents to make it more difficult to obtain patents. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised standards. Some of our patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a reexamination proceeding, or during litigation, under the revised criteria.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to attempt to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that our patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may file an injunction to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the PTO, to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nWe may rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology, food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology, food, chemical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur common stock is approved for quotation on the OTC Markets\u2019 OTCQB marketplace under the symbol \u201cPURE.\u201d The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter equity securities and provides significantly less liquidity than a listing on the Nasdaq Stock Markets or other national securities exchange. The OTCQB securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market is limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our common stock. Quotes for stocks included on the OTCQB are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers as are those for the Nasdaq Stock Market or the NYSE. Therefore, prices for securities traded solely on the OTCQB may be difficult to obtain.\nTrading on the OTCQB Marketplace as opposed to a national securities exchange has resulted and may continue to result in a reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our company:\n\u25cf the liquidity of our common stock;\n\u25cf the market price of shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financing to support our operations and the implementation of our business plan;\n\u25cf the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf the number of market markers in shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock; and\n\u25cf the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock.\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock have historically been volatile.\nIn addition, the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf announcements regarding the status of our regulatory efforts;\n\u25cf the determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, likely resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf the sale by us of our common or preferred stock or other securities, or the anticipation of sales of such securities;\n\u25cf the trading volume of our common stock, particularly if such volume is light;\n\u25cf the introduction of new products or services, or product or service enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf developments with respect to our or our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights or regulatory approvals or denials;\n\u25cf announcements of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf sales or anticipated sales of our common stock by our insiders (management and directors);\n\u25cf conditions and trends in our industry;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the OTCQB, and the market for shares of novel technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that in some cases may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, this volatility could adversely affect an investor\u2019s ability to sell shares of our common stock, and/or the available price for such shares, at any given time.\nOur common stock is deemed to be \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability requirements.\nShares of our common stock are subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules as that term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline.\nBroker-dealers dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stock. Moreover, broker-dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. Such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could limit the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\nPotential sales or issuances of our common stock to raise capital, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause dilution to our current stockholders and the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have historically supported our operations through the issuance of equity securities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Although we may not be successful in obtaining financing through equity sales on terms that are favorable to us in the future, if at all, any such sales that do occur could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities to any new investors, or the anticipation of such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our available cash to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, which may never occur.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our stock.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us that is not approved by our Board, even if such events may be beneficial to the interests of stockholders. For example, our Board, without stockholder approval, has the authority and power to authorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and such preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Further, the one-for-eight reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock that we effected on August 14, 2012 has increased the proportion of unissued and authorized common shares to issued and outstanding common shares, which could allow our Board to issue large numbers of additional shares of our common stock that could significantly reduce the voting power of our current stockholders. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our charter documents may make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest or other change of control transaction involving the Company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction could cause stockholders to lose a substantial premium over the then-current market price of their shares.", "PERMNO": 83896, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "PURE"}
