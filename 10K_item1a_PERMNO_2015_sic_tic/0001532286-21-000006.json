Risk Factors\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including under the section titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described are not the only ones we face. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results. If any of these risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and a stockholder could lose all or part of its investment.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business is cyclical and depends on capital spending and well completions by the onshore oil and natural gas industry, and the level of such activity is volatile. Our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nOur business is cyclical, and we depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop, and produce oil and natural gas, which, in turn, largely depends on prevailing industry and financial market conditions that are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and related products;\n\u2022the level of global and domestic oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022the supply of, and demand for, hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services and equipment;\n\u2022governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022available pipeline, storage, and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022worldwide political, military, and economic conditions;\n\u2022global or national health epidemics or concerns, such as the recent coronavirus outbreaks, which may reduce demand for oil, natural gas, and related products because of reduced global or national economic activity;\n\u2022lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022federal, state, and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, as well as E&P activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u2022economic and political conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022actions of OPEC, its members, and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production levels, including announcements of potential changes to such levels;\n\u2022advances in exploration, development, and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u2022global weather conditions and natural disasters; and\n\u2022uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to access capital.\nA decline in oil and natural gas commodity prices may adversely affect the demand for our products and services and the rates we are able to charge.\nOur business depends, to a significant extent, on the level of unconventional resource development activity and corresponding capital spending of oil and natural gas companies, which are strongly influenced by current and expected oil and natural gas prices. Volatility or weakness in oil and natural gas commodity prices (or the perception that oil and natural gas commodity prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. Historically, oil and natural gas commodity prices have been extremely volatile. During the past five years ending December 31, 2020, the posted price for West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) oil has ranged from a low of $(36.98) per barrel in April 2020 to a high of $77.41 per barrel in June 2018, and the Henry Hub spot market price of gas has ranged from a low of $1.33 per MMBtu in September 2020 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018. Oil and natural gas commodity prices were particularly volatile in 2020 as a result of multiple significant factors impacting supply and demand in the global oil and natural gas markets, including those relating to the coronavirus pandemic. In 2020, the daily spot prices for WTI crude oil ranged from a high of $63.27 per barrel to a low of $(36.98) per barrel, and the Henry Hub spot market price of gas ranged from a low of $1.33 per MMBtu to a high of $3.14 per MMBtu. Oil and natural gas commodity prices are expected to continue to be volatile. If the prices of oil and natural gas continue to decline or remain depressed for a lengthy period, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nSignificant factors that are likely to affect near-term commodity prices include the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations continue to reduce oil export prices and increase production; the effect of U.S. energy, monetary, and trade policies; the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and throughout the world, including the potential for macro weakness; geopolitical and economic developments in the U.S. and globally; changes to energy and EPA policies; and overall North American natural gas supply and demand fundamentals, including the pace at which export capacity grows. For additional information, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic; Industry Trends and Outlook\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.\nThe products and services we provide are, to a substantial extent, deferrable in the event oil and natural gas companies reduce capital expenditures. As a result, we may experience lower utilization of, and may be unable to increase rates or be forced to lower our rates for, our equipment and services in weak oil and natural gas commodity price environments. Even if oil and natural gas prices improve, E&P operator activity may not materially increase, as they remain focused on operating within their capital plans. Moreover, any substantial and unexpected drop in commodity prices in the future, even if the drop is relatively short-lived, or expectations of such a drop or of prolonged weak oil and natural gas commodity price environments, could similarly affect our customers\u2019 expectations and capital spending, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.\nReduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas as a result of decreased capital spending may also have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices, to the extent the reduced number of wells for us to service more than offsets increasing completion activity and intensity.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a decline in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession, adverse events relating to the energy industry, or regional, national, or global economic conditions and factors, particularly a slowdown in the E&P industry, could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased exploration and development spending by our customers, decreased demand for oil and natural gas, and decreased prices for oil and natural gas.\nIncreased attention to climate change and conservation measures may reduce oil and natural gas demand.\nIncreased attention to climate change, consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, and competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal, fuel cells, and biofuels) could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and therefore our products and services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment of the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise debt and equity capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments, and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas production and related infrastructure projects. Such developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. These developments may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, impacting our future financial results.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the U.S. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development. If activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development persists or increases, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic\nThe recent coronavirus pandemic and related economic repercussions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe coronavirus pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty, and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. These events have directly affected our business and have exacerbated the potential negative impact from many of the risks described in this Annual Report, including those relating to our customers\u2019 capital spending and trends in oil and natural gas prices. For example, demand for our products and services has and continues to decline as our customers continue to revise their capital budgets downwards and swiftly adjust their operations in response to lower commodity prices. In addition, the decline in market conditions resulted in goodwill impairment charges of $296.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020. We are also experiencing inefficiencies and logistical challenges surrounding stay-at-home orders and remote work arrangements, travel restrictions, and an inability to commute to certain facilities and job sites, as we provide services and products to our customers.\nIn the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, OPEC+ was initially unable to reach an agreement to continue to impose limits on the production of crude oil. The convergence of these events created the unprecedented dual impact of a global oil demand decline coupled with the risk of a substantial increase in supply. Oil demand significantly deteriorated as a result of the virus outbreak in March 2020 and corresponding preventative measures taken around the world to mitigate the spread of the virus, and at the same time, aggressive increases in production of oil by Saudi Arabia and Russia created a significant surplus in the supply of oil. While OPEC+ agreed in April 2020 to cut production, downward pressure on commodity prices has continued, as the coronavirus pandemic has continued with resurgences in the U.S. and worldwide.\nGiven the nature and significance of the events described above, we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business; however, we believe that in addition to the impacts described above, other current and potential impacts of these recent events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022disruption to our supply chain for raw materials essential to our business, including restrictions on importing and exporting products;\n\u2022notices from customers, suppliers, and other third parties arguing that their non-performance under our contracts with them is permitted as a result of force majeure or other reasons;\n\u2022liquidity challenges, including impacts related to delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies;\n\u2022a credit rating downgrade of our corporate debt and potentially higher borrowing costs in the future;\n\u2022a need to preserve liquidity, which could result in a delay or change in our capital investment plan;\n\u2022cyber security issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyber attacks in the current environment of remote connectivity;\n\u2022litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to coronavirus and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters, and insurance arrangements;\n\u2022reduction of our workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022additional impairments along with other accounting charges as demand for our services and products decreases;\n\u2022infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers, and other third parties in areas in which we operate;\n\u2022changes in the regulation of the production of hydrocarbons, such as the imposition of limitations on the production of oil and gas by states or other jurisdictions, that may result in additional limits on demand for our products and services;\n\u2022actions undertaken by national, regional, and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects; and\n\u2022a structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel, and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression.\nGiven the dynamic nature of these events, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the coronavirus pandemic and related market conditions will persist, the full extent of the impact they will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows or the pace or extent of any subsequent recovery.\nThe confluence of events described above have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could have, a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial debt obligations could have significant adverse consequences on our business and future prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $346.7 million of 8.750% Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) outstanding, and we had $37.9 million of availability under the 2018 ABL Credit Facility (as defined and described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report), net of outstanding letters of credit of $0.5 million. Subject to the restrictions in the 2018 ABL Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) in the future. Our current or future level of indebtedness could have significant adverse consequences on our business and future prospects, including in the following ways:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022limiting management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in our business and the economy generally;\n\u2022limiting our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our indebtedness under the 2018 ABL Credit Facility may vary with prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness; and\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments with respect to our indebtedness depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations. For example, we may not be able to consummate dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Also, our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. In addition, any debt restructuring transactions may involve the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities that could result in material dilution to our stockholders, and these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. An event of default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under the applicable agreement and an event of default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the indebtedness outstanding under any other debt agreements to which we are a party. Any such accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments. In addition, any failure to make payments on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nRestrictions in our debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nThe 2018 ABL Credit Facility (as defined and described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report) and the indenture governing our Senior Notes have, and future financing agreements could have, restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022transfer or sell assets;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from any non-guarantor restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022create unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe restrictions in our debt agreements could also impact our ability to obtain capital to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our debt arrangements may impose on us.\nA breach of any covenant in our debt agreements will result in a default under the applicable agreement and an event of default under such agreement if there is no grace period or if such default is not cured during any applicable grace period. An event of default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under the applicable agreement and an event of default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the indebtedness outstanding under any other debt agreements to which we are a party. Any such accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nUncertainty relating to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations.\nLoans to us and our domestic related subsidiaries under the 2018 ABL Credit Facility (as defined and described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report) may be base rate loans or LIBOR loans. LIBOR is calculated by reference to a market for interbank lending, and it is based on increasingly fewer actual transactions. This reduction increases the subjectivity of the LIBOR calculation process and increases the risk of manipulation. Actions by the regulators or law enforcement agencies, as well as ICE Benchmark Administration (the current administrator of LIBOR), may result in changes to the manner that LIBOR is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. U.S. Dollar LIBOR will likely be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; however, the timing of this shift is currently unknown. SOFR is an overnight rate instead of a term rate, making SOFR an inexact replacement for LIBOR, and there is not an established process to create robust, forward-looking, SOFR term rates. Changing the benchmark rate for LIBOR loans from LIBOR to SOFR requires calculations of a spread. Industry organizations are attempting to structure the spread calculation in a manner that minimizes the possibility of value transfer between counterparties, borrowers, and lenders by the transition, but there is no assurance that the calculated spread will be fair and accurate. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be implemented. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the 2018 ABL Credit Facility to determine the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our interest expense cannot yet be determined.\nCompetition and Market Risks\nWe may be unable to maintain existing prices or implement price increases on our products and services.\nWe periodically seek to increase the prices on our products and services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry and as a result, we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers\u2019 activity levels, and current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their actual or perceived ability to fund exploration and development activities, which may limit our ability to increase or maintain prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity, including new well service rigs, wireline units, and coiled tubing units, may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase prices.\nEven when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset rising costs. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices for our services. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our pricing and to increase our pricing as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIntense competition in the markets for our dissolvable plug products may lead to pricing pressures, reduced sales, or reduced market share.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion for new technologies as additional competing products enter the market. Throughout 2020 we experienced, and we continue to experience, a decline in the pricing and profitability of our dissolvable plug products and, to a lesser extent, our composite plug products. Any further declines in the future may harm our business.\nWe compete with major domestic and international oilfield services companies, many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do. We have experienced pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. Likewise, our customers may seek pricing declines more precipitously than our ability to reduce costs, leaving us unable to achieve or maintain pricing to our customers at a level sufficient to cover our costs.\nWe are continuing to work on reducing manufacturing costs of our products, as well as introducing new and differentiated technology to improve profitability, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. If the amounts we are able to charge customers for our dissolvable plug products decline further or are insufficient to cover our costs, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial or technical resources, and greater name recognition than we do.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes several large companies that compete in many of the markets we serve, as well as numerous small companies that compete with us on a local basis. The oilfield services industry competes primarily on a regional basis, and the intensity of competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. We believe the principal competitive factors in the market areas we serve include price, equipment quality, supply chains, balance sheet strength and financial condition, product and service quality, safety record, availability of crews and equipment, and technical proficiency.\nMany of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and other resources than we do. The greater size of many of our competitors provides them with cost advantages as a result of their economies of scale and their ability to obtain volume discounts and purchase raw materials at lower prices. As a result, such competitors may have stronger bargaining power with their suppliers and have an advantage over us in pricing as well as securing a sufficient supply of raw materials during times of shortage. Many of our competitors also have better brand name recognition, stronger presence in more geographic markets, more established distribution networks, larger customer bases, more in-depth knowledge of the target markets, and the ability to provide a much broader array of products and services. Some of our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the research and development, promotion, and sale of their products and better withstand the evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions as compared to us. Our operations may be adversely affected if our competitors introduce new products or services with better features, performance, prices, or other characteristics than our products and services or expand into service areas where we operate. Our operations may also be adversely affected if our competitors are able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements.\nCompetitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services and products, particularly during industry downturns, either of which would harm our business and operating results. Significant increases in overall market capacity have also caused active price competition and led to lower pricing and utilization levels for our services and products. The competitive environment has intensified since the industry downturn that began in late 2014, which caused an oversupply of, and reduced demand for, oilfield services, and we have seen substantial reductions in the prices we can charge for our services and products. Any significant future increase in overall market capacity for completion services may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur operations are subject to conditions inherent in the oilfield services industry.\nConditions inherent in the oil and natural gas industry can cause personal injury or loss of life, disruption or suspension in operations, damage to geological formations, damage to facilities, substantial revenue loss, business interruption, and damage to, or destruction of, property, equipment, and the environment. Such risks may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022equipment defects;\n\u2022liabilities arising from accidents or damage involving our fleet of trucks and other equipment;\n\u2022explosions and uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures and industrial accidents;\n\u2022blowouts;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022cratering;\n\u2022loss of well control;\n\u2022collapse of the borehole; and\n\u2022damaged or lost equipment.\nDefects or other performance problems in the products that we sell or services that we offer could result in our customers seeking damages from us for losses associated with these defects or other performance problems. In addition, our services could become a source of spills or release of fluids, including chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing activities, at the site where such services are performed, or could result in the discharge of such fluids into underground formations that were not targeted for fracturing or well completion activities, such as potable aquifers, or at third-party properties. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution, and other environmental damages and could result in a variety of claims, losses, and remedial obligations that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The existence, frequency, and severity of such incidents could affect operating costs, insurability, and relationships with customers, employees, and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our safety record as unacceptable or otherwise experience material defects in our products or performance problems, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue, and any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation with our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nOur assets require capital for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment, and we may require capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur equipment requires capital investment in maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we spent approximately $2.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively, on capital expenditures related to maintenance, and we expect to spend approximately $13 million to $14 million on capital expenditures related to maintenance in 2021. Our equipment typically does not generate revenue while it is undergoing maintenance, refurbishment, or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade, or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update our products and services. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand and the increase in cost to maintain labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects, and results of operations and may increase costs. In addition, although such projects may require material capital expenditures, there is no assurance that they will generate a positive return.\nRisks Related to Our Customers and Suppliers\nIf we are unable to accurately predict customer demand or if customers cancel their orders on short notice, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margins. Conversely, insufficient inventory would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships.\nWe often place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand. Anticipating customer demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. Our forecasts of customer demand are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into the forecasts. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to the purchase of material or manufactured products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. As a result, we would hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margin and adversely affect financial results. Conversely, if we\nunderestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect profit margins, increase inventory obsolescence, and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations are concentrated solely in the domestic and Canadian E&P industry, which, as described above, is subject to volatility and, therefore, credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, and/or results of operations. In the course of our business, we hold accounts receivable from our customers. In the event of the financial distress or bankruptcy of a customer, we could lose all or a portion of such outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer. Further, if a customer was to enter into bankruptcy, it could also result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense or loss of expected revenues to us.\nIn addition, during times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our products and services.\nWe are dependent on customers in a single industry. The loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition, prospects, and results of operations.\nOur customers are engaged in the oil and natural gas E&P business, which has been historically volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 37% of total revenues. If we were to lose several key alliances over a relatively short period of time or if one of our largest customers fails to pay or delays in paying a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, we could experience an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. Additionally, the E&P industry is characterized by frequent consolidation activity. Changes in ownership of our customers may result in the loss of, or reduction in, business from those customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nCertain of our product lines are subject to the risk of supplier concentration, and certain of our product lines are subject to exclusive distribution arrangements, which we may not be able to maintain.\nCertain of the product lines depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers and vendors. As a result of this concentration in some supply chains, our business and operations could be negatively affected if certain key suppliers were to experience significant disruptions affecting the price, quality, availability, or timely delivery of their products. The partial or complete loss of any one of those key suppliers, or a significant adverse change in the relationship with any such suppliers, through consolidation or otherwise, may limit our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our product lines.\nIn addition, we have arrangements with certain technology companies and manufacturers that give us exclusive distribution rights to certain product offerings. In some cases, we are, or may in the future will be, required to meet certain minimum volume or other requirements in order to retain our arrangement. If any of these companies or manufacturers terminate our right to sell some or all of their products, modify or terminate our exclusive distribution arrangement, or change the applicable terms and conditions of sale, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRegulatory, Compliance, and Legal Risks\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage or other litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, prospects, and results of operations.\nOur services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, or the environment, or the suspension of our operations. As the wells we service continue to become more complex, our exposure to such inherent risks becomes greater as downhole risks increase exponentially with an increase in complexity and lateral length. Our operations are also exposed to risks of labor organizing and risks of claims for alleged employment-related liabilities, including risks of claims related to alleged wrongful termination or discrimination, wage payment practices, retaliation claims, and other human resource related matters. Litigation arising from operations where our facilities are located, or our services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims, including claims for exemplary damages. For example, transportation of heavy equipment creates the potential for our trucks to become involved in roadway accidents, which in turn could result in personal injury or property damages lawsuits being filed against us.\nWe maintain what we believe is customary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against most potential losses, but such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, especially as the inherent risks in our operations increase with increasing well complexity, and we are not fully insured against all risks, including alleged employment-related liabilities. Further, our insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The current trend in the insurance industry is towards larger deductibles and self-insured retentions. In addition, insurance may not be available in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable, compelling us to have larger deductibles or self-insured retentions to effectively manage expenses. As a result, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities or situations where we have high deductibles or self-insured retentions that expose us to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, or results of operations.\nIn recent years, oilfield services companies have been the subject of a significant volume of wage and hour-related litigation, including claims brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), in which employee pay practices have been challenged. We have been named as defendants in these lawsuits, and we do not maintain insurance for alleged wage and hour-related litigation. Some of these cases remain outstanding and are in various states of negotiation and/or litigation, and the results or costs of any such cases may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The frequency and significance of wage- or other employment-related claims may affect expenses, costs, and relationships with employees and regulators. Additionally, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, or results of operations.\nDelays or restrictions in obtaining, or inability to obtain or renew, permits or authorizations by our customers for their operations or by us for our operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our operations and the operations of our customers require permits or authorizations from one or more governmental agencies or other third parties to perform drilling and completion and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing. Such permits or approvals are typically required by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. We are also required to obtain federal, state, local, and/or third-party permits and authorizations in some jurisdictions in connection with our wireline services and trucking operations. The requirements for permits or authorizations vary depending on the location where the associated activities will be conducted. As with most permitting and authorization processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit or approval to be issued, and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. In Texas, rural water districts have begun to impose restrictions on water use and may require permits for water used in drilling and completion activities. In addition, some of our customers\u2019 drilling and completion activities may take place on federal land or Native American lands, requiring leases and other approvals from the federal government or Native American tribes to conduct such drilling and completion activities. Permitting, authorization, or renewal delays, the inability to obtain new permits, or the revocation of current permits could cause a loss of revenue and potentially have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding issues of health, safety, and protection of the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for penalties, damages, or costs of remediation or other corrective measures. Any changes in laws or government regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local, and tribal laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, clean air and drinking water, wetlands, endangered species, greenhouse gases, air pollution, the environment, occupational health and safety, chemical use and storage, waste management, waste disposal, and\ntransportation of waste and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials. Our operations involve risks of environmental liability, including leakage from an operator\u2019s casing during our operations or accidental spills of hazardous materials onto or into surface or subsurface soils, surface water, or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability, or both. In some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Additionally, environmental concerns, including clean air, drinking water contamination, and seismic activity, have prompted investigations that could lead to the enactment of regulations, limitations, restrictions, or moratoria that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business. Actions arising under these laws and regulations could result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties (administrative, civil, or criminal), revocations of permits to conduct business, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures, and/or claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste, nuisance, or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may also include the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, revocation of permits and temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location, and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, and results of operations. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements or limitations, restrictions, or moratoria on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities at a federal, state, or local level could significantly delay or interrupt our operations, limit the amount of work we can perform, increase our costs of compliance, or increase the cost of our services, thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIf we do not perform our operations in accordance with government, industry, customer, or our own stringent occupational safety, health, and environmental standards, we could lose business from our customers, many of whom have an increased focus on environmental and safety issues.\nWe are subject to the oversight of the EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation (the \u201cDOT\u201d), U.S. Nuclear Regulation Commission, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, OSHA, and state regulatory agencies that regulate operations to prevent air, soil, and water pollution. The energy extraction sector is one of the sectors designated for increased enforcement by the EPA, which will continue to regulate our industry in the years to come, potentially resulting in additional regulations that could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, or financial condition.\nThe EPA regulates air emissions from all engines, including off-road diesel engines that are used by us to power equipment in the field under the CAA Tier 4 emission standards (the \u201cTier 4\u201d standards). The Tier 4 standards require substantial reductions in emissions of particulate matter and nitrous oxide from off-road diesel engines. Such emission reductions can be achieved through the use of appropriate control technologies. Under these U.S. emission control regulations, we could be limited in the number of certain off-road diesel engines we can purchase if we are unable to find a sufficient number of Tier 4-compliant engines from manufacturers. Further, these emission control regulations could result in increased capital and operating costs.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations could lead to material increases in our costs, and liability exposure, for future environmental compliance and remediation. Additionally, if we expand the size or scope of our operations, we could be subject to regulatory requirements that are more stringent than the requirements under which we are currently allowed to operate or require additional authorizations to continue operations. Compliance with this additional regulatory burden could increase our operating or other costs.\nFederal, state, and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could prohibit, restrict, or limit hydraulic fracturing operations, or increase our operating costs.\nOur businesses are dependent on hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels.\nThere is considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions. In 2016, the EPA issued final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of methane emissions released during hydraulic fracturing. However, the EPA has taken several steps to delay implementation of its methane standards, including most recently in September 2020, when the EPA finalized the Reconsideration Rule that rolls back parts of\nthe 2016 performance standards. Various industry and environmental groups have separately challenged both the original standards and the EPA\u2019s attempts to delay implementation of the rule. Separately, in September 2020, the EPA finalized the Review Rule, rescinding requirements related to the regulation of methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. Both rules are subject to ongoing litigation, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order directing the EPA to rescind the Reconsideration Rule by September 2021 and consider revising the Review Rule. Therefore, future obligations continue to remain uncertain. In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending. On March 20, 2015, the BLM finalized a rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, wellbore integrity, and handling of flowback water; however, on December 29, 2017, the BLM issued a rescission of the hydraulic fracturing rule. This rescission and the rule as promulgated are subject to ongoing litigation. The BLM also previously finalized in 2016 similar limitations on methane emissions from venting and flaring and leaking equipment from oil and natural gas activities on public lands, but in September 2018 issued a final rule repealing certain provisions of the 2016 rule and reinstating the pre-2016 regulations. The 2016 rule and the rescission were invalidated by separate federal district courts. As a result, future implementation of methane rules by either the EPA or the BLM is uncertain at this time. However, given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal regulation of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas industry remains a possibility.\nThe EPA has also issued effluent limitation guidelines that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. These rules were finalized in June 2016, and after a legal challenge by environmental groups, in July 2019, the EPA declined to revise the rules. The EPA is currently conducting a study on effluent guidelines for the oil and gas extraction industry, and a draft of this study was published in May 2019. It is unclear how any additional federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities may affect our operations, but additional regulatory burdens on our customers could ultimately result in decreased demand for our products and services.\nVarious studies analyzing the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing have also been performed. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals, or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report, these risks are regulated under various state, federal, and local laws.\nSome states, counties, and municipalities have enacted or are considering moratoria on hydraulic fracturing. For example, New York, Vermont, Maryland, and Washington have banned, or are in the process of banning, the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Alternatively, some municipalities are, or have considered, zoning and other ordinances, the conditions of which could impose a de facto ban on drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing operations. Further, some states, counties, and municipalities are closely examining water use issues, such as permit and disposal options for processed water, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, prospects, and results of operations if such additional permitting requirements are imposed upon our industry. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could reduce demand for our business by making it more difficult or costly for certain customers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, the business and operations of our customers could be subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays, increased operating and compliance costs, and process prohibitions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nExisting or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of greenhouse gases that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects, and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change may negatively impact demand for our products and services. For example, oil and natural gas E&P may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns (e.g., numerous cities, including San Francisco, CA, have banned the use of natural gas in new construction starting in 2020, and other cities, including Seattle, WA, are considering similar initiatives). Federal, state, and local agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws and regulations related to\ngreenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of greenhouse gases that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects, and financial condition. Finally, most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events; if such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nStudies by either state or federal agencies demonstrating a correlation between earthquakes and oil and natural gas activities could result in increased regulatory and operational burdens.\nIn light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. A 2015 U.S. Geological Survey report identified eight states, including Texas, with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction. Any regulation that restricts the ability of our customers to dispose of produced waters or increases their cost of doing business could cause them to curtail operation, which in turn could decrease demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations governing anti-corruption and export controls and economic sanctions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act (\u201cUKBA\u201d), Canada\u2019s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (the \u201cCFPOA\u201d), and similar anti-bribery and anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or improperly providing anything of value for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate and make sales in parts of the world that may be viewed as higher risk for corruption or may have experienced some corruption in the past, and in some instances, strict compliance with the FCPA, UKBA, CFPOA, and similar anti-bribery laws may conflict with local practices. We are also subject to export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including those implemented by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Union and its member states, Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury of the United Kingdom, and other relevant sanctions authorities. These measures can prohibit or restrict transactions and dealings with certain designated persons and in certain countries in which we conduct business. Despite efforts to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that our directors, officers, employees, agents, and third-party intermediaries will comply with such laws and regulations. We can be held liable for violations under such laws and regulations either due to our acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others, including intermediaries working on our behalf.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties or other sanctions, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Any investigation of any actual or alleged violations of such laws could also harm our reputation or have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Additionally, we could face other third-party claims by agents, stockholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our company. Our customers in relevant jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests, and we may be required to dedicate significant time and resources to investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct, regardless of the merit of such allegations. Furthermore, compliance with this additional regulatory burden could increase our operating or other costs.\nChanges in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various transportation regulations including as a motor carrier by the DOT and by various federal, state, and tribal agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications, and insurance requirements. Certain motor vehicle operators are required to register with the DOT. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The DOT periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria, and a revocation could result in a suspension of operations. Since 2010, the DOT has pursued its Compliance, Safety, Accountability (\u201cCSA\u201d) program in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System (\u201cSMS\u201d), which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier\u2019s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow the DOT to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems.\nThe trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as\nchanges in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, and limits on vehicle weight and size. For example, in December 2016, the DOT finalized minimum training standards for new drivers seeking a commercial driver\u2019s license, and effective December 2017, the FMCSA has mandated electronic logging devices in all interstate commercial trucks. As the federal government continues to develop and propose regulations relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices, and an increase in operating expenses. Increased truck traffic may contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas where our operations are performed. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours, and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads. Proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nRisks Related to Technology\nOur success may be affected by the use and protection of our proprietary technology as well as our ability to enter into license agreements. There are limitations to our intellectual property rights and, thus, our right to exclude others from the use of our proprietary technology.\nOur success may be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and by our ability to protect, obtain, and maintain intellectual property assets related to these developments. We rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect this proprietary technology. We have received patents and have filed patent applications with respect to certain aspects of our technology, and we generally rely on patent protection with respect to our proprietary technology, as well as a combination of trade secrets and copyright law, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, and other protective measures to protect intellectual property rights pertaining to our products and technologies. In addition, we are a party to and rely on several arrangements with third parties, which give us exclusive distribution rights to certain product offerings with desirable intellectual property assets, and we may enter into similar arrangements in the future. Such measures may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets, know-how, or other intellectual property in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure. We cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe upon, misappropriate, violate, or challenge our intellectual property rights in the future. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will deter or prevent competitors from creating similar purpose products for our customers. If we are not able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, such intellectual property rights may not provide significant value to our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nMoreover, our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets, and confidential know-how will not prevent third parties from independently developing similar technologies or duplicating such technologies. Publicly available information (e.g., information in issued patents, published patent applications, and scientific literature) can be used by third parties to independently develop technology, and we cannot provide assurance that this independently-developed technology will not be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology. In addition, while we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology, even when regarded as patentable. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. Further, with respect to exclusive third-party arrangements, these arrangements could be terminated, which would result in our inability to provide the services and/or products covered by such arrangements.\nWe may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights, and the value of our intellectual property rights is uncertain.\nWe may become involved in dispute resolution proceedings from time to time to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. In these dispute resolution proceedings, a defendant may assert that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. Third parties from time to time may also initiate dispute resolution proceedings against us by asserting that our businesses infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute, or otherwise violate another party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any such dispute resolution proceedings, and our intellectual property rights may be found invalid or unenforceable or our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute, or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. Also, as a part of resolving such disputes, we may enter into cross-licenses, which could reduce the value of our existing intellectual property rights. The results or costs of any such dispute resolution proceedings may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Any dispute resolution proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly, is inherently unpredictable, and could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, regardless of its outcome.\nOur success may be affected by our ability to implement new technologies and services. Additionally, we rely on a limited number of manufacturers to produce the proprietary products used in the provision of our services, which exposes us to risks.\nOur success may be affected by the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs, methods, and improvements, and our ability to protect, obtain, and maintain intellectual property assets related to these developments. If we are not able to obtain patent or other protection of our technology, it may not be economical for us to continue to develop systems, services, and technologies to meet evolving industry requirements at prices acceptable to our customers. Further, we may face competitive pressure to develop, implement, or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced technologies, changes in technology or improvements in our competitors\u2019 equipment could make our equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to keep our equipment competitive.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of manufacturers for production of the proprietary products used in the provision of our products and services. Termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these manufacturers could affect our ability to provide such products and services to our customers. Although we believe other alternate sources of supply for our proprietary products exist, we would need to establish relationships with new manufacturers, which could potentially involve significant expense, delay, and potential changes to certain product components. Any protracted curtailment or interruptions of the supply of any of our key products, whether or not as a result of termination of our manufacturing relationships or patent infringement claims, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors are large national and multinational companies that may be able to devote greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources to research and development of new systems, services, and technologies and may have a larger number of manufacturers for their products or ability to manufacture their own products. As competitors and others use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we are not able to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If we are unable to compete effectively given these risks, our business and results of operations could be affected.\nOur operations are subject to cyber security risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Accordingly, we rely upon the capacity, reliability, and security of our IT hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Our IT systems are subject to possible breaches and other threats that could cause us harm. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, customer or business data; interruption of business operations; or additional costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber security attacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and could lead to litigation or regulatory action against us.\nRisks Related to Certain Significant Stockholders\nSignificant ownership of our common stock by certain stockholders could adversely affect our other stockholders.\nSCF VII, L.P. and SCF-VII(A), L.P. (collectively, \u201cSCF\u201d) owned approximately 29% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. In addition, certain of our directors are currently employed by SCF. Consequently, SCF is able to strongly influence all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, changes to our organizational documents, and approval of acquisition offers and other significant corporate transactions. In addition, another one of our stockholders beneficially owned approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. This concentration of ownership by a small group of stockholders will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that other stockholders may not view as beneficial. For example, this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock. This concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with significant stockholders.\nA significant reduction by SCF of its ownership interests in us could adversely affect us.\nWe believe that SCF\u2019s substantial ownership interest in us provides them with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful. SCF is not subject to any obligation to maintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any time to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its ownership interest in us. If SCF sells all or a substantial portion of its ownership interest in us, it may have less incentive to assist in our success and its affiliates that serve as members of our board of directors may resign. Such actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, which could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations.\nCertain of our directors may have conflicts of interest because they are also directors or officers of SCF. The resolution of these conflicts of interest may not be in our or other stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nCertain of our directors, namely David C. Baldwin and Andrew L. Waite, are currently officers of SCF\u2019s ultimate general partner. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Waite are also both directors of Forum Energy Technologies, a corporation in which SCF and its affiliates own an approximate 15% equity interest as of December 31, 2020. In addition, Mr. Waite is a director of National Energy Reunited Corp., a corporation in which SCF owns an approximate 9% equity interest as of December 31, 2020. These positions may conflict with such individuals\u2019 duties as one of our directors regarding business dealings and other matters between SCF and us. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our or our other stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nSCF and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our charter could enable SCF to benefit from corporate opportunities that may otherwise be available to us.\nSCF and its affiliates have investments in other oilfield service companies that may compete with us, and SCF and its affiliates may invest in such other companies in the future. SCF, its other affiliates, and its other portfolio companies are referred to herein as the \u201cSCF Group.\u201d Conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and the SCF Group, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities.\nOur charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity that involves any aspect of the energy equipment or services business or industry and that may be from time to time presented to SCF or any of our directors or officers who is also an employee, partner, member, manager, officer, or director of any SCF Group entity, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. Our charter further provides that no such person or party shall be liable to us by reason of the fact that such person pursues any such business opportunity or fails to offer any such business opportunity to us. As a result, any of our directors or officers who is also an employee, partner, member, manager, officer, or director of any SCF Group entity may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities. As a result, by renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to any member of an SCF Group entity or any of our directors or officers who is also an employee, partner, member, manager, officer, or director of any SCF Group entity, our business or prospects could be adversely affected if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours. Our charter provides that any amendment to or adoption of any provision inconsistent with our charter\u2019s provisions governing the renouncement of business opportunities must be approved by the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon. Any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with respect to the foregoing could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nOur executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business, and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future.\nOur future success depends in substantial part on our ability to hire and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers, particularly our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ann G. Fox, and the Chief Operating Officer, David Crombie. These individuals possess extensive expertise, talent, and leadership, and they are critical to our success. The diminution or loss of the services of these individuals, or other integral key personnel affiliated with entities that we acquire in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may not be able to enforce all of the provisions in any employment agreement we have entered into with certain of our executive officers, and such employment agreements may not otherwise be effective in retaining such individuals. In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees of entities that we acquire in the future, which may impact our ability to successfully integrate or operate the assets we acquire.\nWe may be unable to employ, or maintain the employment of, a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel, and other skilled and qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience, including personnel who can perform physically demanding work, and our success depends, in large part, upon our ability to employ and retain key employees, technical personnel, and other skilled and qualified workers. To attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate them at market levels. Recent cost-cutting measures across the organization include decreases in cash and equity compensation for our employees, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our liquidity and competitive position, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. Workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in fields that offer a more desirable work environment as a result of the volatility in the oilfield service industry and the demanding nature of our work. The right-sizing of our and our competitors\u2019 labor force, as well as a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand, has resulted in a reduction of the available skilled labor force to service the energy industry. To the extent that there is an increase in demand for our products or services, there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve. If we are unable to employ and retain skilled workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.\nOther Material Risks\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and our debt agreements place certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, a stockholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on his investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our debt agreements place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, unless we revise our dividend policy, a stockholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on his investment in us will be by selling his common stock at a price greater than the stockholder paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price at which a stockholder purchased his shares of our common stock.\nWe have operated at a loss in the past, and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\nHistorically, we have experienced periods of low demand for our products and services and have incurred operating losses. In the future, we may not be able to reduce our costs, increase our revenues, or reduce our debt service obligations sufficiently to achieve or maintain profitability and generate positive operating income. Under such circumstances, we may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by long-lived assets or other asset impairment charges.\nDetermining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment, such as those relating to revenue growth rates, future cash flows, and future market conditions. Future events or new information, including regarding the general economic environment, E&P activity levels, our financial performance and trends, and our strategies and business plans, may change management\u2019s valuation of long-lived assets, other intangible assets, or other assets in a short amount of time. In particular, prolonged periods of decreased demand, low utilization, changes in technology or market conditions, or sales and other dispositions of assets for amounts less than their carrying value may cause us to recognize impairment charges relating to our long-lived assets, other intangible assets, or other assets that reduce our net income.\nIn 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $296.2 million in our tools, cementing, and wireline reporting units within our Completions Solutions segment due to sharp declines in global crude oil demand, an economic recession associated with the coronavirus pandemic, sharp declines in oil and natural gas prices, and an increased weighted average cost of capital driven by a reduction in our stock price and the Level 2 fair value of our Senior Notes.\nIn 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $20.3 million and an intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million associated with indefinite-lived trade names in our coiled tubing reporting unit within our Completion Solutions segment as well as an intangible asset impairment charge of $7.1 million associated with definite-lived customer relationship intangible assets and a property and equipment impairment charge of $66.2 million in our coiled tubing asset group within our Completion Solutions segment. These impairment charges were due to a reduction of the need for coiled tubing during the drill-out phase of the overall completions process due to a decline in exploration and production capital budgets and activity, an over-supply of new coiled tubing units, and the introduction of dissolvable plug technology.\nAdditionally, in 2019, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $95.0 million associated with indefinite-lived trade names in our completion tools reporting unit within our Completion Solutions segment and due to the transitioning of certain trade names from our 2018 acquisitions to our trade names in order to better funnel and allocate resources, create a stronger identity, facilitate cross-selling, and streamline and simplify communication with existing customers.\nWhile we believe our estimates and assumptions used in impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required, especially if an economic downturn occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if our acquisitions and investments fail to achieve expected returns. Significant impairment charges as a result of a decline in market conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nSeasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nWeather can have a significant impact on demand for our services and products as consumption of energy is seasonal, and any variation from normal weather patterns or cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and severe cold weather, may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions, and damage our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. In addition, most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events. During the winter months (portions of the first and fourth quarters) and periods of heavy snow, ice, or rain, particularly in the northeastern U.S., Michigan, North Dakota, Wyoming, and western Canada, our customers may delay operations, or we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations. Also, during the spring thaw, which normally starts in late March and continues through June, some areas, primarily in western Canada, impose transportation restrictions to prevent damage caused by the spring thaw. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated approximately 0.5% and 2.2%, respectively, of our revenue from our operations in western Canada. Lastly, throughout the year heavy rains adversely affect activity levels because well locations and dirt access roads can become impassible in wet conditions.\nIn addition, we typically have experienced a pause by our customers around the holiday season in the fourth quarter, which may be compounded as our customers exhaust their annual capital spending budgets towards year end.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nThe occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the U.S. or other countries, anti-terrorist efforts, and other armed conflicts involving the U.S. or other countries, including continued hostilities in the Middle East, may adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors, or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if wells, operations sites, or other related facilities are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our products and services. Oil and natural gas-related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers\u2019 operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital, or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside of the U.S., which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business internationally.\nIn 2020, we derived 5.0% of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the U.S. Sales to customers in countries other than the U.S. are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022volatility in political, social, and economic conditions;\n\u2022social unrest, acts of terrorism, war, or other armed conflicts;\n\u2022confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u2022deprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the U.S., or other countries;\n\u2022exposure under the FCPA or similar legislation, as discussed in the below risk factor; and\n\u2022currency exchange controls.\nIf we do not meet the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), the NYSE may delist our common stock.\nTo remain listed on the NYSE, the average closing price of our common stock must not fall below $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. In April 2020, we received written notification from the NYSE that we did not satisfy this minimum average closing share price condition. In June 2020, we regained compliance with this condition; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. Further, our common stock could be delisted if (i) our average market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period is less than $15 million, or (ii) our common stock trades at an \u201cabnormally low\u201d price. If our common stock were to be delisted for any reason, it could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, and negatively impacting our ability to access equity markets and obtain financing.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, discourage, or prevent a takeover attempt even if a takeover might be beneficial to our stockholders, and such provisions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Our charter and bylaws also impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our charter authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our capital stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company. Additionally, for example, our bylaws (i) establish limitations on the removal of directors and on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings, (ii) include advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings, (iii) provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal, our bylaws, and (iv) provide for a classified board of directors, consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each class serving staggered three-year terms, so that only approximately one-third of our directors will be elected each year. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur charter and bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nOur charter and bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our charter or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. These exclusive forum provisions are not intended to apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware has recently held that a Delaware corporation can only use its constitutive documents to bind a plaintiff to a particular forum where the claim involves rights or relationships that were established by or under the DGCL.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the forum selection provisions of our charter and bylaws. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our charter or bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTaking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (ii) the date on which we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d (the fiscal year-end on which at least $700 million of equity securities are held by non-affiliates as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter); (iii) the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (iv) December 31, 2023, which is the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. Pursuant to these reduced disclosure requirements, emerging growth companies are not required to, among other things, comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation, hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation, or obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, emerging growth companies have longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nOur election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods under Section 107 of the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our common stock price may be more volatile.\nOn the other hand, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, compliance with rules and regulations that do not currently apply to us as an emerging growth company will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, may make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and will increase demand on our systems and resources.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In 2017, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and immaterial misstatements were identified as result. We believe that these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated as of December 31, 2020.\nAny newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, we may be unable to prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nWe may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal or state tax purposes, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state income tax NOLs of approximately $345.0 million, which will begin to expire between 2023 and 2034. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382).\nDetermining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of the corporation\u2019s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, with respect to a corporation following its recognition of an NOL, utilization of such NOL would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, generally determined by multiplying the value of the corporation\u2019s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate (as defined in Section 382). However, this annual limitation would be increased under certain circumstances by recognized built-in gains of the corporation existing at the time of the ownership change. In the case of an NOL that arose in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, any unused annual limitation with respect to an NOL generally may be carried over to later years, subject to the expiration of such NOL 20 years after it arose.\nThe issuance of additional stock in the IPO, combined with ownership shifts over the rolling three-year period, resulted in an ownership change under Section 382, and we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOLs prior to their expiration. Future changes in our stock ownership or future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our NOLs, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 17251, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "NINE"}
