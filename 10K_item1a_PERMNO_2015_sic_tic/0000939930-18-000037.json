RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor calls and webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201ctargets\u201d and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Alliance One International, Inc. securities. In connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important risk factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time.\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Operations\nOur reliance on a small number of significant customers may adversely affect our financial statements.\nThe customers of our leaf tobacco business are manufacturers of cigarette and other tobacco products. Several of these customers individually account for a significant portion of our sales in a normal year.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, each of Philip Morris International, Inc., China Tobacco International Inc. and Imperial Brands, PLC, including their respective affiliates, accounted for more than 10% of our revenues from continuing operations. In addition, tobacco product manufacturers have experienced consolidation and further consolidation among our customers could decrease such customers\u2019 demand for our leaf tobacco or processing services. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nContinued vertical integration by our customers could materially adversely affect our financial statements.\nDemand for our leaf tobacco or processing services could be materially reduced if cigarette manufacturers continue to significantly vertically integrate their operations, either through acquisition of our competitors, establishing new operations or contracting directly with suppliers. During fiscal 2014, we completed the formation of a joint venture in Brazil with China Tobacco International Inc. The joint venture entity had previously operated as one of our subsidiaries since its formation in 2012. Japan Tobacco, Inc. has vertically integrated operations in Malawi, Brazil and the United States. In addition, Philip Morris International, Inc. acquired supplier contracts and related assets in Brazil in order to procure leaf directly. In general, our results of operations have been adversely affected by vertical integration initiatives. Although recently, some customers began reversing certain aspects of their previous vertical integration of operations, further vertical integration by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nGlobal shifts in sourcing customer requirements may negatively impact our organizational structure and asset base.\nThe global leaf tobacco industry has experienced shifts in the sourcing of customer requirements for tobacco. For example, significant tobacco production volume decreases have occurred in the United States and Western Europe from historical levels. At the same time, production volumes in other sourcing origins, such as Brazil and Africa, have stabilized. Additional shifts in sourcing may occur as a result of currency fluctuations, including changes in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. A shift in sourcing origins in Europe has been influenced by modifications to the tobacco price support system in the European Union (EU). Customer requirements have changed due to these variations in production, which could influence our ability to plan effectively for the longer term in Europe.\nWe may not be able to timely or efficiently adjust to shifts in sourcing origins, and adjusting to shifts may require changes in our production facilities in certain origins and changes in our fixed asset base. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, restructuring charges as we continue to adjust to shifts in sourcing. Adjusting our capacity and adjusting to shifts in sourcing may have an adverse impact on our ability to manage our costs, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\n- 7-\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Operations (continued)\nOur financial results will vary according to growing conditions, customer indications and other factors, which reduces your ability to gauge our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur financial results, particularly the quarterly financial results, may be significantly affected by fluctuations in tobacco growing seasons and crop sizes which affect the supply of tobacco. Crop sizes may be affected by, among other things, crop infestation and disease, the volume of annual tobacco plantings and yields realized by supplier and suppliers' elections to grow crops other than tobacco. The cultivation period for tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors, including the weather and other natural events, such as hurricanes or tropical storms, and our processing schedule and results of operations for any quarterly period can be significantly altered by these factors.\nThe cost of acquiring tobacco can fluctuate greatly due to crop sizes and increased competition in certain markets in which we purchase tobacco. For example, short crops in periods of high demand translate into higher average green prices, higher throughput costs and less volume to sell. Furthermore, large crops translate into lower average green prices, lower throughput costs and excess volume to sell.\nFurther, the timing and unpredictability of customer indications, orders and shipments cause us to keep tobacco in inventory, increase our risk and result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results. The timing of shipments can be materially impacted by shortages of containers and vessels for shipping as well as infrastructure and accessibility issues in ports we use for shipment. We may, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, keep a significant amount of processed tobacco in inventory for our customers to accommodate their inventory management and other needs. Sales recognition by us and our subsidiaries is based on the passage of ownership, usually with shipment of product. Because individual shipments may represent significant amounts of revenue, our quarterly and annual financial results may vary significantly depending on our customers\u2019 needs and shipping instructions. These fluctuations result in varying volumes and sales in given periods, which also reduces your ability to compare our financial results in different periods or in the same periods in different years.\nSuppliers who have historically grown tobacco and from whom we have purchased tobacco may elect to grow other crops instead of tobacco, which affects the world supply of tobacco and may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nIncreases in the prices for other crops have led and may in the future lead suppliers who have historically grown tobacco, and from whom we have purchased tobacco, to elect to grow these other, more profitable, items instead of tobacco. A decrease in the volume of tobacco available for purchase may increase the purchase price of such tobacco. As a result, we could experience an increase in tobacco crop acquisition costs which may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur advancement of inputs to tobacco suppliers could expose us to losses.\nWe advance seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and other products related to growing tobacco to our suppliers, which represent prepaid inventory, in many countries to allow the suppliers to grow tobacco, which we are contractually obligated to purchase. The advances to tobacco suppliers are settled as part of the consideration paid upon the suppliers delivering us unprocessed tobacco at market prices. Two primary factors determine the market value of the tobacco suppliers deliver to us: the quantity of tobacco delivered and the quality of the tobacco delivered. Unsatisfactory quantities or quality of the tobacco delivered could result in losses with respect to advances to our tobacco suppliers or the deferral of those advances.\nWhen we purchase tobacco directly from suppliers, we bear the risk that the tobacco will not meet our customers\u2019 quality and quantity requirements.\nIn countries where we contract directly with tobacco suppliers, including Argentina, Brazil, the United States and certain African countries, we bear the risk that the tobacco delivered will not meet quality and quantity requirements of our customers. If the tobacco does not meet such market requirements, we may not be able to sell the tobacco we agreed to buy and may not be able to meet all of our customers\u2019 orders, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWeather and other conditions can affect the marketability of our inventory.\nLike other agricultural products, the quality of tobacco is affected by weather and the environment, which can change the quality or size of the crop. If a weather event is particularly severe, such as a major drought or hurricane, the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to our customers, which would result in a reduction in revenues. If such an event is also widespread, it could affect our ability to acquire the quantity of products required by customers. In addition, other items can affect the marketability of tobacco, including, among other things, the presence of:\n\u2022\nnon-tobacco related material;\n\u2022\ngenetically modified organisms; and\n\u2022\nexcess residues of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides.\nA significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the tobacco crops we buy could make it difficult for us to sell such tobacco or to fill our customers\u2019 orders. In addition, in the event of climate change, adverse weather patterns could develop in the growing regions in which we purchase tobacco. Such adverse weather patterns could result in more permanent disruptions in the quality and size of the available crop, which could adversely affect our business.\n- 8-\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Operations (continued)\nWe face increased risks of doing business due to the extent of our international operations.\nWe do business in more than 35 countries, some of which do not have stable economies or governments. Our international operations are subject to international business risks, including unsettled political conditions, uncertainty in the enforcement of legal obligations, including the collection of accounts receivable, fraud risks, expropriation, import and export restrictions, exchange controls, inflationary economies, currency risks and risks related to the restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries. These risks are exacerbated in countries where we have advanced substantial sums or guaranteed local loans or lines of credit for the purchase of tobacco from suppliers. For example, in 2006 as a result of the political environment, economic instability, foreign currency controls and governmental regulations in Zimbabwe, we deconsolidated our Zimbabwe subsidiary, Mashonaland Tobacco Company LTD (\"MTC\"). Subsequently, we determined that the significant doubt about our ability to control MTC was eliminated and we have reconsolidated MTC as of March 31, 2016.\nOur international operations are in areas where the demand is for the export of lower priced tobacco. We have significant investments in our purchasing, processing and exporting operations in Argentina, Brazil, Malawi, Tanzania and Turkey.\nIn recent years, economic problems in certain African countries have received wide publicity related to devaluation and appreciation of the local currency and inflation, including the classification of Malawi's economy as highly inflationary. Devaluation and appreciation can affect our purchase costs of tobacco and our processing costs. In addition, we conduct business with suppliers and customers in countries that have relatively recently had or may be subject to dramatic political regime change. In the event of such dramatic changes in the government of such countries, we may be unable to continue to operate our business, or adequately enforce legal obligations, after the change in a manner consistent with prior practice.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and we operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations. Although our corporate policy prohibits foreign bribery and we have adopted procedures to promote compliance, there is no assurance that our policy or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire. Failure to comply with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws) could lead to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures (including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies, and controls, the imposition of a compliance monitor at our expense and potential personnel changes and/or disciplinary actions), any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities also could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2010, we entered into settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve their investigations regarding potential criminal and civil violations of the FCPA. The settlements resulted in the disgorgement in profits and fines totaling $19.45 million, which have been paid. Both settlements also required us to retain an independent compliance monitor for a three year term that was completed September 30, 2013.\nOur exposure to foreign tax regimes, and changes in U.S. or foreign tax regimes, could adversely impact our business.\nWe do business in countries that have tax regimes in which the rules are not clear, are not consistently applied and are subject to sudden change. This is especially true with regard to international transfer pricing. Our earnings could be reduced by the uncertain and changing nature of these tax regimes. Certain of our subsidiaries are and may in the future be involved in tax matters in foreign countries. While the outcome of any of these existing matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we are vigorously defending them and do not currently expect that any of them will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. However, should one or more of these matters be resolved in a manner adverse to our current expectation, the effect on our results of operations for a particular fiscal reporting period could be material.\nWe seek to optimize our tax footprint across all operations in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions alike. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d) which changed corporate tax rates, the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses, among other things. We estimate that the Tax Act could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time changes in the period in which tax reform is enacted and as further regulations may be enacted, and could result in a material increase or decrease in the company\u2019s effective tax rate. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, and actions taken by us as a result of the Tax Act.\n- 9-\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Operations (continued)\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct our business in many countries around the world. Our business is generally conducted in U.S. dollars, as is the business of the leaf tobacco industry as a whole. However, we generally must purchase tobacco in non-U.S. countries using local currency. As a result, local country operating costs, including the purchasing and processing costs for tobaccos, are subject to the effects of exchange fluctuations of the local currency against the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our costs for purchasing and processing tobacco in such currencies increases. We attempt to minimize such currency risks by matching\nthe timing of our working capital borrowing needs against the tobacco purchasing and processing funds requirements in the currency of the country where the tobacco is grown. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies can significantly affect our operating results.\nIn addition, the devaluation of foreign currencies has resulted and may in the future result in reduced purchasing power from customers whose capital resources are denominated in those currencies. We may incur a loss of business as a result of the devaluation of these currencies now or in the future.\nCompetition could erode our earnings.\nThe leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive. We are one of two global publicly held competitors in the leaf tobacco industry, each with similar global market shares. Competition is based primarily on the prices charged for products and services as well as the merchant\u2019s ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing and financing of tobacco. In addition, there is competition in all countries to buy the available tobacco. The loss or substantial reduction of any large or significant customer could reduce our earnings.\nIn addition to the two primary global independent publicly held leaf tobacco merchants, the cigarette manufacturers increasingly buy tobacco directly from suppliers. We also face increasing competition from new local and regional independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead and good customer connections at the local level, particularly Brazil and parts of Africa, where the new entrants have been able to capitalize in the global transition to those markets. Any of these sources of new competition may result in less tobacco available for us to purchase and process in the applicable markets.\nRisks Related to Our Recent Investments in New Business Lines\nOur recent investments as part of our expanded business strategy have been in companies with limited histories that are operating in newly developing markets and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nOur minority investment in December 2017 in the Criticality joint venture and our indirect Canadian subsidiary\u2019s investments to acquire majority interests in Goldleaf Pharm Inc. (\"Goldleaf\") and Canada's Island Garden Inc. (\"CIG\") in January 2018, and the operation of these businesses, involve a high degree of risk. These investments are in businesses with limited operating histories-Criticality commenced operations in June 2017, CIG commenced operations in August 2013, and Goldleaf proposes to commence operations upon receipt of requisite licenses and approvals. We cannot assure you that as these operations further develop they will be profitable or otherwise sustainable. While these businesses involve the cultivation and/or processing of agricultural products similar in certain ways to leaf tobacco, and accordingly share commonality with our agronomy, traceability and agricultural product processing expertise, they are subject to commercial and regulatory challenges different from our existing businesses and with respect to which we do not have the same level of experience. In addition, these businesses are subject to numerous additional risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nDeveloping regulatory framework. In Canada, the cultivation and sale of cannabis (also known as marijuana) has been legal for medical use since 2001, subject to certain restrictions and compliance with applicable regulations. CIG currently cultivates and sells cannabis in Canada for this limited purpose pursuant to licenses and permits issued by applicable regulatory authorities, and Goldleaf proposes to do the same upon receipt of requisite licenses and permits. The Canadian federal government has announced an intention to enact legislation to legalize and regulate the cultivation, sale and use of cannabis for recreational use and a bill to that effect was passed by the federal House of Commons in November 2017. That bill has not yet been passed by the federal Senate. The bill provides that each Canadian province will have the power to determine the method of distribution and sale, taxation and other matters pertaining to cannabis. While certain provinces, including Ontario and British Columbia, have taken actions in anticipation of enactment of the federal bill, additional required provincial regulations have yet to be adopted. In the event that federal and applicable provincial legislation and regulation are not enacted or adopted or are materially delayed, the growth opportunities of Goldleaf and CIG will be curtailed from levels anticipated in expectation of such legalization of cannabis for recreational use. In addition, in the event that such legislation and regulations are enacted and adopted, it is uncertain whether Goldleaf and CIG will be able to obtain all licenses, permits and other regulatory approvals required to allow them to cultivate and supply cannabis in Canada for recreational use.\n- 10-\nRisks Related to Our Recent Investments in New Business Lines (continued)\nOur recent investments as part of our expanded business strategy have been in companies with limited histories that are operating in newly developing markets and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. (continued)\nThe Criticality joint venture was formed to procure industrial hemp under the North Carolina Industrial Hemp Commission\u2019s Pilot Program (the \u201cPilot Program\u201d) and to extract cannabidiol (known as \u201cCBD\u201d), a non-psychoactive oil, for sale to consumers. In general, while hemp is classified as a controlled substance under U.S. federal law, pursuant to the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the \u201cFarm Bill\u201d) to the extent that industrial hemp is cultivated and processed as part of a state-supervised agricultural pilot program, it is exempt from regulation as a controlled substance. Local, state and federal laws and regulations applicable to the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Criticality to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter\nits business plan. In addition, violations of these laws (including provisions applicable to participation in the Pilot Program), or allegations of such violations, could disrupt its business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. Moreover, the provisions of the Farm Bill that provide for the exemption of industrial hemp as a controlled substance expire in 2019. If such provisions are not renewed or otherwise extended, Criticality may no longer be permitted to pursue its business after the expiration of these provisions.\nIt is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to these businesses with respect to the nature of the products produced by these businesses. We cannot predict the nature of any such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on these businesses.\n\u2022\nNecessity of rigorous compliance measures. The failure of one of these businesses to comply with regulatory requirements, including the implementation and effectiveness of rigorous controls over inventory, could result in fines, penalties, and the loss of necessary licenses and permits which could have a material adverse effect of the continued viability of such business and our investment in such business.\n\u2022\nSuccess may attract better funded competitors. Even if the businesses in which we have invested are initially successful, such success, or the general maturing of the industry, may attract additional competition from larger competitors with greater capital resources which could adversely affect these businesses and our investment in these businesses.\n\u2022\nIllicit competition. To the extent that an illicit market continues with respect to the products produced by these businesses, the costs incurred by these businesses to comply with regulatory requirements, as well as applicable excise and sales taxes, may make it difficult to compete with the illicit market or may dampen growth opportunities.\nViolations of applicable law by Goldleaf or CIG, including an unlawful transfer of cannabis inventory to jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the sale of such product is unlawful or within Canada other than for permitted use, may subject our company to potential criminal sanctions.\nAlthough we believe the investments in Goldleaf and CIG are not prohibited under United States federal and state laws so long as Goldleaf and CIG\u2019s operations remain in compliance with applicable Canadian and U.S. laws, under current U.S. law, it is unlawful to operate a business from the U.S. that engages in the possession, manufacture, distribution, and/or sale of a controlled substance, including cannabis, in a foreign country where such activities are illegal. Although we anticipate that operational decisions of Goldleaf and CIG will be made by personnel not located in the United States and funding of Goldleaf and CIG, to the extent any additional funding is required, would be made by subsidiaries not located in the United States, there is a risk that if Goldleaf or CIG were to violate Canadian federal, provincial or local law with respect to the manufacture, distribution, and/or sale of cannabis, including an unlawful transfer of cannabis inventory to jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the sale of such product is unlawful or within Canada other than for permitted use, that may subject our company to potential criminal sanctions and civil forfeitures in the United States.\nFurther, under current U.S. law, it is unlawful to import controlled substances, including cannabis, into the United States, or to transport controlled substances through U.S. territorial waters, on U.S. flagged vessels and U.S. registered aircraft, or accompanied by U.S. citizens or resident aliens. Although we anticipate that Goldleaf and CIG will take precautions to ensure that their operations remain in compliance with all U.S. laws that might apply to the foreign exportation or transport of cannabis, there is a risk that if Goldleaf or CIG were to violate U.S. federal or state law with respect to the manufacture, distribution, sale and/or transport of cannabis, even outside the United States, that may subject our company to potential criminal sanctions and civil forfeitures in the United States.\nIn addition, United States federal and state laws applicable to the investment in these Canadian subsidiaries is subject to evolving interpretations. Although we do not believe that such activities of Goldleaf and CIG effected in compliance with applicable laws in Canada would result in a violation of United States federal or state laws by Alliance One International, Inc. or our United States-based subsidiaries, we cannot assure you that United States federal or state law enforcement agencies may not adopt different interpretations of applicable law or that our view of prevailing applicable law will be upheld if so challenged.\n- 11-\nRisks Related to Our Recent Investments in New Business Lines (continued)\nWe may be unable to transmit any funds generated by Goldleaf and CIG to any United States entity and such funds may not be used to fund the payment of obligations of our U.S. based operations, including Alliance One.\nAn indirect Canadian subsidiary, itself owned by a foreign-based subsidiary of AOI, made its investment in Goldleaf and CIG with funds generated by operations of our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to repatriate any funds generated by Goldleaf or CIG into the United States and certain United States federal laws may restrict us from doing so. Accordingly, funds generated by these subsidiaries, or by the potential future sale of either or both of these subsidiaries, may not be available to fund the payment of obligations of our U.S. based operations, including AOI.\nWe may be adversely affected by customer, investor, lender, and regulatory reactions to our investments in Goldleaf and CIG.\nIt is uncertain whether the activities of Goldleaf and CIG may adversely influence decisions of United States federal or state regulatory authorities with respect to Alliance One International, Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries, even if such Canadian subsidiaries are engaged in cannabis production and supply in compliance with the laws and authorization of the jurisdiction where the activity takes place. In addition, it is uncertain whether our tobacco customers, lenders and investors may react adversely to our investment in these businesses, although we do not presently believe that to be the case. Any such material adverse reaction may materially adversely affect our business, ability to renew or obtain additional necessary financing and/or the trading price of our common stock and publicly traded debt securities.\nOur expansion into the sale and supply of e-liquid products to consumers subjects us to a number of risks.\nThe expansion of our business to include the sale by subsidiaries of e-liquid products to consumers, directly through the internet and through distributors and other channels, subjects us to additional risks and uncertainties. For example, such subsidiary may be held liable if any of its products is found to be the cause of, or a contributing factor in the cause of, personal injury of any type. Although we insure against such potential risks, such insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities and the cost of maintaining insurance is subject to change. Additionally, as more products are brought to market, we may need to increase such insurance coverage, which may adversely affect the profitability of this business. Similar potential product liability risks apply with respect to sale of other products to consumers, including by CIG and Goldleaf.\nRisks Relating to Other Aspects of Our Operations\nLow investment performance by our defined benefit pension plan assets may increase our pension expense, and may require us to fund a larger portion of our pension obligations, thus, diverting funds from other potential uses.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible employees. Our pension expense and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nIf plan assets perform below the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense, future pension expense will increase. Further, as a result of the global economic instability or other economic market events, our pension plan investment portfolio may experience significant volatility.\nThe proportion of pension assets to liabilities, which is called the funded status, determines the level of contribution to the plan that is required by law. In recent years, we have funded the plan in amounts as required, but changes in the plan\u2019s funded status related to the value of assets or liabilities could increase the amount required to be funded. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension funding obligations, diverting funds that would otherwise be available for other uses.\nWe rely on internal and externally hosted information technology systems and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology (IT) systems, including systems hosted by service providers. The enterprise resource planning system (SAP) we have implemented throughout the Company, for example, is hosted by Capgemini and our domestic employee payroll system is hosted by Ceridian. Although we have disaster recovery plans and several intrusion preventive mitigating tools and services in place, which are active inline services or are tested routinely, our portfolio of hardware and software products,\n- 12-\nRisks Relating to Other Aspects of Our Operations (continued)\nWe rely on internal and externally hosted information technology systems and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business. (continued)\nsolutions and services and our enterprise IT systems, including those hosted by service providers, may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses or other malicious software programs and cyber-attacks, including system hacking and other cyber-security breaches. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation, and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.\nWe have identified material weaknesses related to our internal controls and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nIn the course of downsizing and terminating certain operations of our subsidiary, Alliance One Tobacco (Kenya) Limited (\u201cAOTK\u201d), and preparing our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we identified errors in accounts receivable, inventory, sales and cost of goods sold in AOTK. Specifically, the value of inventory was overstated due to improper accounting for shrinkage, deferred crop costs, lower of cost or market valuations and inventory counts. Further, sales and other operating revenues, and trade and other receivables, net were incorrectly stated due to improper revenue recognition for external sales. As a result of these errors, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and the selected quarterly financial data for each of the quarters in the fiscal years then ended, our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2015 and selected consolidated statement of operations data for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and selected consolidated balance sheet data at March 31, 2012 and 2011.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2016, several material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed at AOTK and at the regional and corporate levels.\nWe remediated those material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, and we believe that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at March 31, 2018 as reported elsewhere in this Annual Report. Although we intend to continue to aggressively monitor and improve our internal controls, we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses will not occur in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material. Ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock and could also require additional restatements of our prior reported financial information.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nWe may not continue to have access to the capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing on acceptable terms and conditions.\nWe access the short-term capital markets and, from time to time, the long-term markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of acceptable terms and conditions of, such financing are impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings; (ii) the liquidity and volatility of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the current state of the economy, including the tobacco industry. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nWe may not have access to available capital to finance our local operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe have typically financed our non-U.S. local operations with uncommitted short-term operating credit lines at the local level. These operating lines are typically seasonal in nature, normally extending for a term of 180 to 270 days corresponding to the tobacco crop cycle in that location. These facilities are typically uncommitted in that the lenders have the right to cease making loans or demand payment of outstanding loans at any time. In addition, each of these operating lines must be renewed with each tobacco crop season in that jurisdiction. Although our foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under these lines, many of them are guaranteed by us.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $427.3 million drawn and outstanding on short-term seasonal lines with maximum capacity totaling $740.0 million subject to limitations under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Facility\"). Additionally against these lines there was $12.3 million available in unused letter of credit capacity with $4.8 million issued but unfunded.\nBecause the lenders under these operating lines typically have the right to cancel the loan at any time and each line must be renewed with each crop season, there can be no assurance that this capital will be available to our subsidiaries. If a number of these lenders cease lending to our subsidiaries or dramatically decrease such lending, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\n- 13-\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure (continued)\nFailure of foreign banks in which our subsidiaries deposit funds or the failure to transfer funds or honor withdrawals may affect our results of operations.\nFunds held by our foreign subsidiaries are often deposited in their local banks. Banks in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to a higher rate of failure or may not honor withdrawals of deposited funds. In addition, the countries in which these local banks operate may lack sufficient regulatory oversight or suffer from structural weaknesses in the local banking system. Due to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments, these local banks also may be subject to exchange controls and therefore unable to perform transfers of certain currencies. If our ability to gain access to these funds was impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to satisfy the covenants included in our financing arrangements, which could result in the default of our outstanding debt obligations.\nThe agreement governing the ABL Facility includes certain restrictive covenants and a springing covenant requiring that our fixed charge coverage ratio be no less than 1.00 to 1.00 during any period commencing at any time that the excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is less than a specified amount and ending on the first date after excess borrowing availability has been equal to or greater than such specified amount for a period of 30 consecutive days. The agreements governing our other indebtedness and the indentures governing our 8.500% senior secured first lien notes due 2021 (the \u201csenior secured first lien notes\u201d) and our 9.875% senior secured second lien notes due 2021 (the \u201csenior secured second lien notes,\" and, together with the senior secured first lien notes, the \"senior notes\") also include restrictive covenants. Prior to the establishment of the ABL Facility, we sought and obtained waivers and amendments under our existing financing arrangements to avoid future non-compliance with financial covenants and cure past defaults under restrictive covenants. We also paid significant fees to obtain these waivers and consents. You should consider this in evaluating our ability to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and the financial costs of our ability to do so. Any future defaults for which we do not obtain waivers or amendments could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness, much of which is cross-defaulted to other indebtedness.\nWe have substantial debt which may adversely affect us by limiting future sources of financing, interfering with our ability to pay interest and principal on the senior notes and subjecting us to additional risks.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $1,347.6 million of indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness to our current indebtedness levels, including borrowings under the ABL Facility or other short or long-term credit facilities, the related risks that we now face could increase.\nOur substantial debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior notes and our other obligations;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms and to otherwise fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt refinancing, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to paying interest on and the repayment of the principal of our indebtedness. This reduces the amount of cash we have available for making principal and interest payments under the senior notes and for other purposes and makes us more vulnerable to a decrease in demand for leaf tobacco, increases in our operating costs or general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust to changing market conditions and to compete with other global leaf tobacco merchants may be hampered by the amount of debt we owe;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities.\nIn addition, the agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes each contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with certain covenants within the ABL Facility could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. Also, a substantial portion of our debt, including any borrowings under the ABL Facility, bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher debt service requirements, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.\n- 14-\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure (continued)\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future under the terms of the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreement governing the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility provides for a revolving credit line of up to $60.0 million subject to a borrowing base of eligible inventory and accounts receivable, and under certain conditions, we may solicit the lenders under the ABL Facility or other prospective lenders to provide additional revolving loan commitments under the ABL Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $15.0 million (less the aggregate principal amount of any additional notes issued under the indenture governing the senior secured first lien notes). As of March 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility and $60.0 million, subject to limitations under the ABL Facility, was available for borrowing under the ABL Facility and an additional $307.9 million was available for borrowing under other short and long-term credit facilities, including $7.5 million with respect to issued but unfunded letters of credit. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks discussed above could intensify.\nOur debt agreements will contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes contain a number of significant covenants. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility requires us to periodically satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio during any period commencing at any time that excess borrowing availability is less than a specified amount and ending on the first date after excess borrowing availability has been equal to or greater than such specified amount for a period of 30 consecutive days. Complying with these covenants and tests may cause us to take actions that we otherwise would not take or not take actions that we otherwise would take. The failure to comply with these covenants and tests would cause a default under the ABL Facility and under the indentures governing the senior notes and would prevent us from taking certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, paying dividends or redeeming the senior secured first lien notes, the senior secured second lien notes or any subordinated debt. A default, if not waived, could result in the debt under the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes becoming immediately due and payable and could result in a default or acceleration of our other indebtedness with cross-default provisions. If this occurs, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the ABL Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWe may not be able to refinance or renew our indebtedness, including the senior notes and the ABL Facility, or be able to borrow under the ABL Facility or other future credit facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nLoans under the ABL Facility will mature on January 14, 2021. We may not be able to renew or refinance the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, including the senior secured notes, on substantially similar terms, or at all. We may have to pay additional fees and expenses that we might not have to pay under normal circumstances, and we may have to agree to terms that could increase the cost of our debt structure. If we are unable to renew or refinance the ABL Facility, the senior notes or our other indebtedness on terms which are not materially less favorable than the terms currently available to us or obtain alternative or additional financing arrangements, we may not be able to repay the ABL Facility, the senior notes or certain of our other indebtedness, which may result in a default under other indebtedness.\n- 15-\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure (continued)\nWe may not be able to refinance or renew our indebtedness, including the senior notes and the ABL Facility, or be able to borrow under the ABL Facility or other future credit facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. (continued)\nWe may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the ABL Facility, the senior secured first lien notes and the senior secured second lien notes, on or before maturity. Additionally, to the extent permitted under the agreement governing the ABL Facility and indentures governing the senior secured first lien notes and the senior secured second lien notes, we may repurchase, repay or tender for our bank debt, senior secured first lien notes and the senior secured second lien notes or other debt, which may place pressure on future cash requirements to the extent that the debt repurchased, repaid or tendered cannot be redrawn.\nRisks Related to Global Financial and Credit Markets\nVolatility and disruption of global financial and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access financing and expose us to unexpected risks.\nGlobal financial and credit markets expose us to a variety of risks as we fund our business with a combination of cash from operations, short-term seasonal credit lines, the ABL Facility, long-term debt securities and customer advances. We have financed our non-U.S. operations with uncommitted unsecured short-term seasonal lines of credit at the local level. These local operating lines typically extend for a term of up to one year and are typically uncommitted in that the lenders have the right to cease making loans and demand repayment of loans at any time. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $427.3 million drawn and outstanding on short-term foreign seasonal lines and a maximum borrowing capacity under these lines and the ABL Facility totaling $800.0 million subject to limitations under the ABL Facility. Changes in the global financial and credit markets could create uncertainty as to whether local seasonal lines will continue to be available to finance our non-U.S. operations to the extent or on terms similar to what has been available in the past and whether repayment of existing loans under these lines will be demanded prior to maturity. To the extent that local seasonal lines cease to be available at levels necessary to finance our non-U.S. operations or we are required to repay loans under the lines prior to maturity, we may be required to seek alternative financing sources beyond our existing committed sources of funding. Based on the current financial and credit markets, we cannot assure you that such alternative funding will be available to us on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or at all. In the event that we may be required to support our non-U.S. operations by borrowing U.S. dollars under the ABL Facility, we may be exposed to additional currency exchange risk that we may be unable to successfully hedge. Further, there is additional risk that certain banks that are lenders under seasonal lines could be unable to meet contractually obligated borrowing requests in the future if their financial condition were to deteriorate. In addition, we maintain deposit accounts with numerous financial institutions around the world in amounts that exceed applicable governmental deposit insurance levels. While we actively monitor our deposit relationships, we are subject to risk of loss in the event of the unanticipated failure of a financial institution in which we maintain deposits, which loss could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nDerivative transactions may expose us to potential losses and counterparty risk.\nWe may, from time to time, enter into certain derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges are reported as income, and accordingly could materially affect our reported income in any period. In addition, the counterparties to these derivative transactions may be financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we would be subject to risks that these counterparties default under these transactions. In some of these transactions, our exposure to counterparty credit risk may not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions over the last few years have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including bankruptcy. If one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our derivative transactions not secured by any collateral becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we would become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties.\nRisks Relating to the Tobacco Industry\nReductions in demand for consumer tobacco products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe tobacco industry, both in the United States and abroad, continues to face a number of issues that may reduce the consumption of cigarettes and adversely affect our business, sales volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThese issues, some of which are more fully discussed below, include:\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions seeking to ascribe to tobacco product manufacturers liability for adverse health effects associated with smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke;\n\u2022\nsmoking and health litigation against tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022\nincreased consumer acceptance of electronic cigarettes;\n\u2022\ntax increases on consumer tobacco products;\n- 16-\nRisks Relating to the Tobacco Industry (continued)\nReductions in demand for consumer tobacco products could adversely affect our results of operations. (continued)\n\u2022\ncurrent and potential actions by state attorneys general to enforce the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement, or MSA, between state governments in the United States and tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022\ngovernmental and private bans and restrictions on smoking;\n\u2022\nactual and proposed price controls and restrictions on imports in certain jurisdictions outside the United States;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on tobacco product manufacturing, marketing, advertising and sales;\n\u2022\nthe diminishing social acceptance of smoking;\n\u2022\nincreased pressure from anti-smoking groups;\n\u2022\nother tobacco product legislation that may be considered by Congress, the states, municipalities and other countries; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of consolidation among multinational cigarette manufacturers.\nTobacco product manufacturer litigation may reduce demand for our products and services.\nOur primary customers, the leading cigarette manufacturers, have faced thousands of lawsuits brought throughout the United States and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world. These lawsuits have been brought by different types of plaintiffs, including: (1) individuals and classes of individuals alleging personal injury and/or misleading advertising; (2) governments (including governmental and quasi-governmental entities in the United States and abroad) seeking recovery of health care costs allegedly caused by cigarette smoking; and (3) other groups seeking recovery of health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking, including third-party health care payors, such as unions and health maintenance organizations. Damages claimed in some of the smoking and health cases have ranged into the billions of dollars. There have been many jury verdicts for plaintiffs in tobacco product litigation over the past several years. Additional plaintiffs continue to file lawsuits. The effects of the previous and current lawsuits on our customers could reduce their demand for tobacco from us.\nLegislation and regulatory and other governmental initiatives could impose burdensome restrictions on the tobacco industry and reduce consumption of consumer tobacco products and demand for our services.\nThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, extends the authority of the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to regulate tobacco products. This act authorizes the FDA to adopt product standards for tobacco products, including the level of nicotine yield and the reduction or elimination of other constituents of the products, along with provisions for the testing of products against these standards. The act imposes further restrictions on advertising of tobacco products, authorizes the FDA to limit the sales of tobacco products to face-to-face transactions permitting the verification of the age of the purchaser, authorizes a study to determine whether the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products should be increased and requires submission of reports from manufacturers of tobacco products to the FDA regarding product ingredients and other matters, including reports on health, toxicological, behavioral, or physiologic effects of tobacco products and their constituents. The act also mandates warning labels and requires packaging to indicate the percentage of domestically grown tobacco and foreign grown tobacco included in the product. The FDA has adopted regulations under the act establishing requirements for the sale, distribution and marketing of cigarettes, as well as package warnings and advertising limitations.\nIn addition, the act directs the FDA to promulgate regulations requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, preproduction design validation, packing, and storage of a tobacco product conform to current good manufacturing practice. Regulations under the act do not apply to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a manufacturer of tobacco products, or to the producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco suppliers, tobacco warehouses, and tobacco supplier cooperatives unless those entities are controlled by a tobacco product manufacturer, but do apply to our U.S. cut rag processing facility with respect to covered tobacco products.\nIn May 2016, the FDA finalized regulations, which became effective in August 2016, that extend its regulatory authority under the act to tobacco products not previously covered by its regulations, including vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, electronic cigarettes (or, e-cigarettes), e-pipes, and other types of electronic nicotine delivery systems, including e-liquids used in these devices, as well as pipe tobacco and cigars (including little cigars and cigarillos), and future novel tobacco products. These regulations require manufacturers of these additional tobacco products to, among other things submit an application and obtain FDA authorization to market a new tobacco product; register establishment(s) and submit product listing to FDA; submit listing of ingredients; submit information on harmful and potentially harmful constituents; submit tobacco health documents; not introduce into interstate commerce modified-risk tobacco products (e.g., products with label, labeling, or advertising representing that they\nreduce risk or are less harmful compared to other tobacco products on the market) without an FDA order; and include the required warning statement on packaging and advertisements. These regulations will extend to certain of our operations that had not previously been subject to the act, including the processing of pipe tobacco and tobacco for little cigars and cigarillos at our U.S. cut rag processing facility, and to joint ventures and subsidiaries that develop, produce and sell consumable e-liquids. In addition, the May 2016 regulations make these additional tobacco products subject to certain existing restrictions on the sale of cigarettes, including restrictions prohibiting sale to individuals under 18 years of age. In addition, in finalizing the May 2016 regulations, the FDA announced that it intends in the future to issue a proposed product standard that would, if finalized, eliminate characterizing flavors in all cigars, including cigarillos and little cigars.\n- 17-\nRisks Relating to the Tobacco Industry (continued)\nLegislation and regulatory and other governmental initiatives could impose burdensome restrictions on the tobacco industry and reduce consumption of consumer tobacco products and demand for our services. (continued)\nThe full impact of the act, including the May 2016 regulations and any future regulatory action to implement the act, is uncertain. However, if the effect of the act and FDA regulations under the act is a significant reduction in consumption of tobacco products, it could materially adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nReports with respect to the harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years, and the sale, promotion and use of cigarettes continue to be subject to increasing governmental regulation. Since 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have released a number of reports linking cigarette smoking with a broad range of health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic lung disease, and recommending various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. More recent reports focus upon the addictive nature of cigarettes, the effects of smoking cessation, the decrease in smoking in the United States, the economic and regulatory aspects of smoking in the Western Hemisphere, and cigarette smoking by adolescents, particularly the addictive nature of cigarette smoking in adolescence. Numerous state and municipal governments have taken and others may take actions to diminish the social acceptance of smoking of tobacco products, including banning smoking in certain public and private locations.\nA number of foreign nations also have taken steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion, to increase taxes on cigarettes and to discourage cigarette smoking. In some cases, such restrictions are more onerous than those in the United States. For example, advertising and promotion of cigarettes has been banned or severely restricted for a number of years in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Singapore and other countries. Further, in February 2005, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) treaty, the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (\u201cFCTC\u201d), entered into force. This treaty, which is binding on 181 nations as of March 31, 2018, requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would require, among other things, specific actions to prevent youth smoking; restrict or prohibit tobacco product marketing; inform the public about the health consequences of smoking and the benefits of quitting; regulate the content of tobacco products; impose new package warning requirements including the use of pictorial or graphic images; eliminate cigarette smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes; restrict smoking in public places; increase and harmonize cigarette excise taxes; abolish duty-free tobacco sales; and permit and encourage litigation against tobacco product manufacturers.\nDue to the present regulatory and legislative environment, a substantial risk exists that past growth trends in tobacco product sales may not continue and that existing sales may decline. A significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for tobacco products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGovernment actions can have a significant effect on the sourcing of tobacco. If some of the current efforts are successful, we could have difficulty obtaining sufficient tobacco to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nThe WHO, through the FCTC, created a formal study group to identify and assess crop diversification initiatives and alternatives\nto leaf tobacco growing in countries whose economies depend upon tobacco production. The study group began its work in February 2007. In its initial report published later that year, the study group indicated that the FCTC did not aim to phase out tobacco growing, but the study group's focus on alternatives to tobacco crops was in preparation for its anticipated eventual decrease in demand resulting from the FCTC's other tobacco control initiatives.\nIf the objective of the FCTC study group were to change to seek to eliminate or significantly reduce leaf tobacco production and certain countries were to partner with the study group in pursuing this objective, we could encounter difficulty in sourcing leaf tobacco to fill customer requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation, and natural resource management, could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight of industry activities, which may lead to increased levels of expenditures for environmental controls, land use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers, and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business generate carbon emissions. Regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed in certain countries in which we operate. These may include limitations on such emissions, taxes or emission allowance fees on such emissions, various restrictions on industrial operations, and other measures that could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production, and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products. These actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been, and continue to be, subject to governmental investigations into, and litigation concerning, leaf tobacco industry buying and other payment practices.\nThe leaf tobacco industry, from time to time, has been the subject of government investigations regarding trade practices. For example, we were the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice into certain\nbuying practices alleged to have occurred in the industry, we were named defendants in an antitrust class action litigation alleging a conspiracy to rig bids in the tobacco auction markets, and we were the subject of an administrative investigation into certain\n- 18-\ntobacco buying and selling practices alleged to have occurred within the leaf tobacco industry in some countries within the European Union, including Spain, Italy, Greece and potentially other countries.", "PERMNO": 29867, "SIC": 5190, "TIC": "PYXSQ"}
