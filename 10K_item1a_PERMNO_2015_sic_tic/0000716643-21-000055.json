{"cik": "716643", "company": "REGIS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-08-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Delta variant, and the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that has spread globally. COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations. The pandemic may affect the health and welfare of our stylist community, customers, franchise partners or headquarters personnel. As of the date of this filing, our salons across essentially all geographies are allowed to be open; however, states may again decide to require the closure of salons as the level of COVID-19 positive cases continues to fluctuate, as we have already seen in Canada. Each time we are required to close and re-open salons, we will continue to experience the risks and business impacts described here, and further requirements to again close salons or limit and/or modify services or operations may exacerbate these impacts.\nThe continuing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, including the changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, macroeconomic consequences and market reactions thereto, makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and to develop strategies to resume and/or continue operations, to generate growth, or to achieve our initial objectives for fiscal year 2022.\nIn addition, some of our franchisees, many of whom were in the early stages of developing their businesses prior to the onset of the pandemic, have chosen, or may choose, not to resume operation of their salons and/or are facing challenges rehiring employees, reestablishing operations with their landlords and other vendors, and attracting customers back to their salons. As a result, many of our franchisees requested reductions or other modifications to their royalty payments or other amounts due to us, which may be critical to their ability to reestablish operations, and they may simply be unable or unwilling to make lease, royalty or other payments to us and may be unable to continue to operate or may need to close their salons. The removal or reduction of these payments, including the added expense associated with closed locations where we may have residual lease liability, has continued, and is expected to continue, to adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. Customers and employees have been cautious about returning to personal service providers, and we and our franchisees are incurring substantial additional costs to ensure the safety of our employees and customers. Furthermore, as a result of the pandemic, many of our customers have themselves experienced adverse financial impacts, including loss of disposable income, which may limit their spending on personal care, including purchasing of beauty products, or have identified other means for hair care. The trend of increased remote work and utilization of advanced video-conferencing technology has led to a less-formal work environment, which could impact the frequency of our hair care services. In addition, COVID-19 may cause additional workers' compensation claims and customer claims associated with the pandemic. Regarding support for our franchisees, the pandemic could impact workers at our headquarters and/or compromise the performance of our technology center in Fremont, California.\nAs a result, COVID-19 has negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our revenue, increase the cost of salon operations, increase our investment in safety equipment and potentially expose us to additional liability, the combination of which will reduce our profitability, including the profitability of our franchisees. In addition, we retain a residual real estate lease liability of $603.4 million for company-owned and nearly all franchise salons. The combination of the revenue reduction, obligations we ultimately owe to landlords, and other costs both related and unrelated to COVID-19 could significantly reduce or exhaust our available liquidity over time and limit our ability to access liquidity sources.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we currently anticipate a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. The disruption to the global economy and to our business, along with a sustained decline in our stock price, may lead to triggering events that may indicate that the carrying value of certain assets, including accounts receivables, long-lived assets, intangibles, and goodwill, may not be recoverable. Assessing goodwill for impairment requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors, can be difficult to predict.\nCOVID-19, and the volatile local, regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, including government mandates, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results, certain litigation or regulatory risks or the value of our salon brands in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nCOVID-19 may impact the operations of our key suppliers, including our merchandise, personal protective equipment (PPE) and technology suppliers.\nWe depend upon the support of a small number of critical suppliers, including our merchandise, PPE, and technology providers, such as our third-party point-of-sale system supplier. We have experienced limited disruption in operations from these suppliers. The continuing impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to two new merchandising distributors may pose additional disruptions in our supply chain or in the availability of products and services, or could increase the prices we pay to our suppliers, which could result in a material impact to our own operations.\nConsumer shopping trends and changes in manufacturer choice of distribution channels may negatively affect both service and product revenues.\nOur salons are partly dependent on the volume of traffic around their locations in order to generate both service and product revenues. Customer traffic may be adversely affected by changing consumer shopping trends that favor alternative shopping locations, such as the internet. In recent years, we have experienced substantial declines in traffic in some shopping malls and traffic patterns at those salons affect our potential product sales revenues and impact the health of our brands.\nIn addition, we are experiencing a proliferation of alternative channels of distribution, such as blow dry bars, booth rental facilities, discount brick-and-mortar and online professional products retailers, as well as manufacturers selling direct to consumers online, which may negatively affect our product and service revenue. Also, product manufacturers may decide to utilize these other distribution channels to a larger extent than in the past and they generally have the right to terminate relationships with us with little advance notice. These trends could reduce the volume of traffic around our salons, and in turn, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nChanges in regulatory and statutory laws, such as increases in the minimum wage and changes that make collective bargaining easier, and the costs of compliance and non-compliance with such laws, may result in increased costs to our business.\nWith 5,917 locations and approximately 2,446 employees worldwide, our financial results can be adversely impacted by regulatory or statutory changes in laws. Due to the number of people we or our franchisees employ, laws that increase minimum wage rates, employment taxes, overtime requirements or costs to provide employee benefits or administration may result in additional costs to our Company.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and revenues.\nIn our U.S. markets, numerous laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels can affect our business. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretations, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or a prohibition on the operation of our salons.\nA number of U.S. states, Canadian provinces, and municipalities in which we do business with have recently increased, or are considering increasing, the minimum wage, with increases generally phased over several years depending upon the size of the employer. Increases in minimum wages and overtime pay result in an increase in our costs, and our ability to offset these increases through price increases may be limited. In fact, increases in minimum wages have increased our costs over the last five years. In addition, a growing number of states, provinces and municipalities have passed, or are considering passing, requirements for paid sick leave, family leave, predictive scheduling (which imposes penalties for changing an employee's shift as it nears), and other requirements that increase the administrative complexity of managing our workforce. Finally, changes in labor laws, such as recent legislation in Ontario and Alberta that was designed to facilitate union organizing, could increase the likelihood of some of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, it would have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIncreases in minimum wages, administrative requirements and unionization could also have an adverse effect on the performance of our franchisees, especially if the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) treats our franchisees as \"joint employers\" with us or if our franchisees are classified as large employers under minimum wage statutes because of their affiliations with us. In addition, we must comply with state employment laws, including the California Labor Code, which has stringent requirements and penalties for non-compliance.\nVarious state and federal laws govern our relationships with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties. A franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Also, under the franchise business model, we may face claims and liabilities based on vicarious liability, joint-employer liability or other theories or liabilities. All such legal actions could not only result in changes to laws and interpretations, which could make it more difficult to appropriately support our franchisees and, consequently, impact our performance, but could also result in expensive litigation with our franchisees, third parties or government agencies, which could adversely affect both our profits and our important relationships with our franchisees. In addition, other regulatory or legal developments may result in changes to laws or to the franchisee/franchisor relationship that could negatively impact the franchise business model and, accordingly, our profits.\nIn addition to employment and franchise laws, we are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those affecting public companies, product manufacturing and sale and those governing the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Compliance with new, complex, and changing laws may cause our expenses to increase. In addition, any non-compliance with laws or regulations could result in penalties, fines, product recalls and enforcement actions or otherwise restrict our ability to market certain products or attract or retain employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the general economic environment may impact our business and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S., Canadian and U.K.'s economies have an impact on our business. General economic factors that are beyond our control, such as recession, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, energy costs, unemployment trends, extreme weather patterns, viruses, pandemics, stay-at-home orders and other casualty events that influence consumer confidence and spending, may impact our business. In particular, visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by increases in unemployment rates and decreases in discretionary income levels.\nChanges in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns may impact our revenue.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely manner to changes in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns. If we do not timely identify and properly respond to evolving trends and changing consumer demands for hair care or services, our sales may decline. As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in remote work and schooling, which reduces traffic in downtowns, city centers, and other business districts where our salons are located and reduces our revenue. Furthermore, we may accumulate additional inventory and be required to mark down unsold inventory to prices that are lower than normal prices, which could adversely impact our margins and could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating Risks\nTo date we have been successful in selling our company-owned salons to franchise owners and we are re-engineering our corporate and field infrastructure to support a fully-franchised portfolio, which involves risks to our financial condition and results of operations in both our company-owned and franchise portfolios.\nWe have been successful in selling our company-owned salons to franchise owners and, as a result, our inability to re-engineer the infrastructure and reduce our costs in time and in amounts necessary to effectively support a fully-franchised salon portfolio may reduce the anticipated economic benefit of the transformation in the near term.\nWe are now substantially dependent on franchise royalties and the overall success of our franchisees' salons. It customarily takes new franchisees time to develop their salons and increase their sales. Further, a number of our historically successful and more experienced franchisees are onboarding new salon operations or recovering from the impacts of COVID-19. This could adversely impact our revenue and profitability during this next stage of our transformation. In order to support and enhance our franchisees' businesses, we may need to invest in certain unanticipated new capabilities and/or services and we will need to determine the appropriate amount of investment to optimize the success of our franchisees, while ensuring that the level of investment supports our expected return on those investments. If we are not able to identify the right level of support and effectively deliver those resources to our franchisees, our results of operations and business may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our transition to a fully-franchised model may expose us to additional legal, compliance and operational risks specific to this different business model, including the business failure of unproven new salon owners.\nWe are moving away from our wholesale distribution model to third-party preferred supplier arrangements.\nWe are exiting the wholesale distribution model and have entered into preferred supplier agreements with two suppliers. This change will reduce our future revenue and we may incur significant costs related to the transition. In addition, if our new suppliers are unable to source the products at the prices expected by our franchisees, our franchisees' profitability and our profitability may be adversely impacted. Further, economic instability and other impactful events and circumstances in the regions in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of our suppliers, our suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards, product safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of products from our suppliers and their manufacturers to our salons, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the areas in which they are located are beyond our control.\nIt is important for us and our franchisees to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders.\nGuest loyalty is strongly dependent upon the stylists who serve our guests and the customer experience in our salons. Qualified, trained stylists are key to a memorable guest experience that creates loyal customers. In order to profitably grow our business, it is important for our salons to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders and to adequately staff our salons. Because the salon industry is highly fragmented and comprised of many independent operators, the market for stylists is typically highly competitive. In addition, labor shortages, increases in minimum wage requirements may impact the number of stylists considering careers outside the beauty industry. In most markets, we and our franchisees have experienced a shortage of qualified stylists or a reduction in the hours stylist will work. Offering competitive wages, benefits, education, and training programs are important elements to attracting and retaining qualified stylists. In addition, due to challenges facing the for-profit education industry, cosmetology schools have experienced declines in enrollment, revenues, and profitability in recent years. If the cosmetology school industry sustains further declines in enrollment or some schools close entirely, or if stylists leave the beauty industry, we expect that we and our franchisees would have increased difficulty staffing our salons in some markets. In addition, we have observed that some stylists are not comfortable coming back to the salon environment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the enhanced unemployment amounts provided by the federal government during the COVID-19 pandemic, in some cases, decreases stylists' incentive to come back to work or return to their full workload. If our salons are not successful in attracting, training and retaining stylists or in staffing salons, our same-store sales or the performance of our franchise business could experience periods of volatility or sales could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends in part on the success of our franchisees, which operate independently.\nAs of June 30, 2021, approximately 95.3% of our salons were franchised locations. We derive revenues associated with our franchised locations primarily from royalties and fees. Our financial results are therefore substantially dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. As a franchise business, we are dependent on our franchisees.\nWe have limited control over how our franchisees' businesses are operated. Though we have established operational standards and guidelines, franchisees own, operate, and oversee the daily operations of their salon, including employee-related matters and pricing. If franchisees do not successfully operate their salons in compliance with our standards, our brand reputation and image could be harmed, and our financial results could be affected. We could experience greater risks as the scale of our franchised salons increases. Further, some franchise owners may not successfully execute the rebranding and/or turnaround of under-performing salons that we have transferred to them, particularly in the post-COVID environment.\nIn addition, our franchisees are subject to the same general economic risks as our Company, and their results are influenced by competition for both guests and stylists, market trends, price competition and disruptions in their markets and business operations due to public health issues, including pandemics, severe weather and other external events. Like us, they rely on external vendors for some critical functions and to protect their company data. They may also be limited in their ability to open new locations by an inability to secure adequate financing, especially because many of them are small businesses with much more limited access to financing than our Company, by the limited supply of favorable real estate for new salon locations, or by government-mandated restrictions on salon operations due to COVID-19 or other pandemics. They may also experience financial distress as a result of over-leveraging, which could negatively affect our operating results due to delayed or non-payments to us. The bankruptcy, default, abandonment, or other default or breach by or of a franchisee could also expose us to liability under leases, which are generally sub-leased by us to our franchisees.\nA deterioration in the financial results of our franchisees, a failure of our franchisees to renew their franchise agreements or closure of locations could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments and fees. We also must continue to attract qualified franchisees and work with them to make their businesses successful.\nIn addition, challenges in supporting our expanding franchise system could cause our operating results to suffer. If we are unable to effectively select and train new franchisees and support our growing franchisee base, it could affect our brand standards, cause disputes between us and our franchisees, and potentially lead to material liabilities.\nOur business is dependent on franchisees continuing to operate. If a franchisee exits the franchise system, we need to recruit an existing or new franchisee to run that salon location or our salon count would decline and our revenues would decline. A decline in salon count could also reduce the value of our brands. Additionally, we are dependent on our franchisees to grow their business in order for our business to grow. However, franchisees may not have access to capital, labor, etc., to support their growth.\nWe may face challenges operating the salons that TBG transferred back to us, and our inability to operate them successfully, close them, or transfer these salons to new ownership could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 31, 2019, we re-acquired certain assets that were used in the operation of the mall-based salon business in the United States and Canada for which we had residual real estate lease liability from our original sale of the salons to TBG. The transfer was consummated in connection with an assignment for the benefit of creditors by TBG. The assets acquired in connection with the salon reacquisition are, in the aggregate, unprofitable and the total lease liability related to the salons is approximately $9 million as of June 30, 2021. We are attempting to renegotiate these lease obligations and re-franchise certain salons; however, the outcome of those negotiations is currently uncertain. In addition to the salons, we assumed limited liabilities for certain employee benefit-related payments. In connection with the reacquisition of the salons, we also terminated certain other agreements with TBG for which we had already recorded a full reserve against the promissory notes evidencing TBG's obligations to us.\nWhile we believe the salons transferred back to us have been able to continue operations without any significant disruptions so far, except for the impacts arising out of COVID-19, these salons have experienced significant changes in recent years. As a result, there is a risk of increased levels of employee attrition, customer losses, and supplier interruption. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of the employee base, particularly our stylists, as well as fruition of other risks could adversely affect our results of operations and could diminish the value of the salons in any future transfer of the ownership of these salons to new ownership as part of our continued commitment to converting to a fully-franchised model. If we are not able to successfully operate these salons, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to cover the lease liabilities for these salons. As a result, we may be compelled to close certain salons or sell the assets at depressed values. In the meantime, we expect that our operation of these salons may adversely impact our results of operations. Our inability to successfully operate the salons or transfer them to new stable ownership, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nData security and data privacy compliance requirements could increase our costs, and cybersecurity incidents could result in the compromise of potentially sensitive information about our guests, franchisees, employees, vendors or Company and expose us to business disruption, negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe normal operations of our business and our investments in technology involve processing, transmitting and storing potentially sensitive personal information about our guests, employees, franchisees, vendors and our Company, all of which require the appropriate and secure utilization of such information and subjects us to increased focus regarding our data security compliance. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware, designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations (and their third-party vendors) are constantly evolving and high-profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive information have occurred at a number of large U.S. companies in recent years. Furthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the U.S. and abroad, including requirements for varying levels of customer notification in the event of a data breach. These laws are changing rapidly and vary among jurisdictions. We will continue our efforts to meet any applicable privacy and data security obligations; however, it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase our costs. We rely on commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing, transmitting, and storing of sensitive information. As this risk of cyber-attacks increases, our related insurance premiums may also increase. Despite the security measures and processes we have in place, our efforts (and those of our third-party vendors), to protect sensitive guest, employee, franchisee, vendor, and Company information may not be successful in preventing a breach in our systems or detecting and responding to a breach on a timely basis. As a result of a security incident or breach in our systems, our systems could be interrupted or damaged, and/or sensitive information could be accessed by third parties. If that occurred, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to stop visiting our salons altogether or our franchisees could exit the system due to lack of confidence. Such events could also lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies' obligations to protect sensitive data becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could potentially subject us to fines, penalties, other regulatory sanctions, or lawsuits with the possibility of substantial damages. The costs to remediate security incidents or breaches that may occur could be material. Also, as cyber criminals become more frequent, intense, and sophisticated, the costs of proactive defensive measures may increase. Furthermore, while our franchisees are independently responsible for data security at their franchised salon locations, a security incident or breach at a franchised salon location could negatively affect public perception of our brands. More broadly, our incident response preparedness and disaster recovery planning efforts may be inadequate or ill-suited for a security incident and we could suffer disruption of operations or adverse effects to our operating results.\nOur ability to franchise our company-owned SmartStyle salons and successfully operate this business is dependent on our relationship with Walmart.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had 1,757 SmartStyle or Cost Cutters salons within Walmart locations. Walmart is our largest landlord, and we believe we are Walmart's largest tenant. Our business within each of those 1,757 salons relies primarily on the traffic of visitors to the Walmart location, so our success is tied to Walmart's success in bringing shoppers into their stores. We have limited control over the locations and markets in which we open new SmartStyle locations, as we only have potential opportunities in locations offered to us by Walmart. Furthermore, Walmart has the right to close up to 100 of our salons per year for any reason, upon payment of certain penalties, to terminate lease agreements for breach, such as if we failed to conform with required operating hours, subject to a notice and cure period, and to terminate the lease if the Walmart store is closed. In fiscal year 2017, we began franchising SmartStyle salons. Future franchising activity will require, and be limited, by the approval of Walmart on a location-by-location basis. Walmart may not give its approval to franchise some or all of our company-owned salons. Further, Walmart may attempt to impose changes to the terms and conditions of our agreements, which may be contrary to our economic interests. Operating SmartStyle salons adds complexity in overseeing franchise compliance and coordination with Walmart.\nOur future growth and profitability may depend, in part, on our ability to build awareness and drive traffic with advertising and marketing efforts and on delivering a quality guest experience to drive repeat visits to our salons.\nOur future growth and profitability may depend on the effectiveness, efficiency and spending levels of our marketing and advertising efforts to drive awareness and traffic to our salons. In addition, delivering a quality guest experience is crucial to drive repeat visits to our salons. We are developing our marketing and advertising strategies, including national and local campaigns, to build awareness, drive interest, consideration and traffic to our salons. We are also focusing on improving guest experiences to provide brand differentiation and preference as well as ensure our guests' needs are met. If our marketing, advertising, and improved guest experience efforts do not generate sufficient customer traffic and repeat visits to our company-owned and franchise-owned salons, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our future growth and profitability may depend on the effectiveness, efficiency and spending levels of our marketing and advertising efforts to drive awareness and traffic to our salons. In addition, delivering a quality guest experience is crucial to drive repeat visits to our salons. We are developing our marketing and advertising strategies, including national and local campaigns, to build awareness and drive interest, consideration and traffic to our salons. We are also focusing on improving guest experiences to provide brand differentiation and preference, and to ensure our guests' needs are met. If our marketing, advertising, and improved guest experience efforts do not generate sufficient customer traffic and repeat visits to our salons, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands, our customers' connection to our brands and a positive relationship with our franchisees. Declining franchisee revenue reduces the advertising funds available to invest in the brands and a decline in the Company's investment in its brands could reduce brand awareness and the overall value of our brands. Brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity, including via social media or if they result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationships with our franchisees, our growth strategies, our development efforts or the ordinary course of our, or our franchisees' business. Other incidents may arise from events that may be beyond our control and may damage our brands, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their employees relating to health, safety, welfare or otherwise, litigation and claims, security breaches or other fraudulent activities associated with our back-office management or payment systems, and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Consumer demand for our products and services and our brands' value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products or services. This could result in lower sales and, ultimately, lower royalty income, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. If we experience an interruption in their operation, our results of operations may be affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to collect daily sales information and guest demographics, generate payroll information, monitor salon performance, manage salon staffing and payroll costs, and other functions. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacker attempts, security breaches and natural disasters. In addition, some of our management information systems are currently developed and maintained by external vendors, and some are outdated or limited functionality exists that are not owned by us or not exclusively provided by us. These management information systems may require upgrades or replacements periodically, which involve implementation and other operational risks. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, or to provide an affordable long-term solution, could disrupt our business operations and result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue and reputational damage. Further, if our external vendors fail to adequately provide technical support for any one of our key existing management information systems or if new or updated components are not integrated smoothly, we could experience service disruptions that could result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses, decrease our revenues and generally harm our business, reputation and brands. Also, any such conduct with respect to our franchisees could also result in litigation.\nWe rely on external vendors for products and services critical to our operations.\nWe rely on external vendors for the manufacture, supply and distribution of our owned brand products, other retail products we sell, and products we use during salon services, such as color and chemical treatments. We also rely on external vendors for various services critical to our operations and the security of certain Company data. Our dependence upon vendors exposes us to operational, reputational, financial and compliance risk.\nIf our product offerings do not meet our guests' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, and exposure to legal and reputational risk. All our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products and packages we buy, for either use on a guest during a service or resale to the public, comply with all safety and quality standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns or mislabeling could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities.\nOur vendors are also responsible for the security of certain Company data, as discussed above. If one of our key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products and services, or their systems fail, or are compromised or the quality of their systems deteriorate, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial loss.\nThe use of social media may have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nOur reputation is critical to our ability to compete and succeed. However, our reputation may be damaged by negative publicity on social media or other channels regarding the quality of products or services we provide. There has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, which allow individuals to be heard by a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative or false commentary regarding us or the products or services we offer may be posted on social media platforms at any time. Customers value readily available information and may act on information without further investigation or regard to its accuracy. The harm to our reputation may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Our reputation may also be damaged by factors that are mostly or entirely out of our control, including actions by a franchisee or a franchisee's employee.\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction, to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms could adversely affect our business, financial condition and revenues.\nFailure to simplify and standardize our operating processes across our brands could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe expect standardization of operating processes across our brands, marketing and products to enable us to simplify our operating model and decrease our costs and believe failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to grow revenue and realize further efficiencies within our results of operations.\nOur enterprise risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor the risks that we face. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for assessing and managing known risks, compliance with applicable laws and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in all market environments or against all types of risk in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs, the performance and value of our business could be adversely affected.\nInsurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by, or made available to, us in order to manage certain types of risks, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, retentions, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses, or if any of our insurance policies or programs are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe franchise agreements require each franchisee to maintain specified insurance coverages and levels. Certain extraordinary hazards, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to franchisees may not be made on a timely basis. Any such loss or delay in payment could have a material and adverse effect on a franchisee's ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise agreement, including its ability to make royalty payments.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nWe have made significant investments in company-owned technology, including point-of-sale and salon management system that may not yield results on the timing or amounts we expect.\nInvestments made in company-owned technology, including our internally developed point-of-sale and salon management system, Opensalon\u00ae Pro, may not yield the profitable results in the timeframe or in amounts that we anticipate. This new system also increases our susceptibility to data breaches, which could erode franchisee trust and materially impact the business. We expect to make the technology a required brand standard in all of our franchise-owned salons, which may result in litigation from our franchisees. Additionally, we entered into a transition services arrangement with our former point-of-sale and salon management system supplier to facilitate the transition of our remaining salons to Opensalon Pro. If the supplier is unable to perform or the transition is delayed, our results may be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the covenants in our existing financing arrangement, we may not be able to access our existing revolving credit facility, and we may face an accelerated obligation to repay our indebtedness.\nIf we fail to comply with our existing financing arrangements, such a failure may cause a default under our financing arrangement, which could limit our ability to obtain new replacement financing or additional financing under our existing credit facility, require us to pay higher levels of interest or accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness. COVID-19 or other significant business disruptions could ultimately impair our ability to comply with the liquidity covenant, which could preclude our ability to access our credit facility or accelerate our debt repayment obligation, which is secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company's assets.\nOur existing credit facility expires in March 2023 and we may not be able to re-finance or re-finance at a similar rate.\nIn March 2023, our existing debt is due and management expects to re-finance the debt prior to the expiration date. Uncertainty in the business, including the impact of COVID-19, may reduce our borrowing options and increase the interest rate. An increase to the rate or a decrease to the facility may impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and may materially impact our operations. Additionally, the Company may need to look to other sources of financing, including using the Company's At-The-Market (ATM) offering. Use of the ATM or other equity offerings may be dilutive to shareholders.\nIf our capital investments in developing new technology-enabled capabilities and improving current technology infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are currently making, and expect to continue to make, strategic investments in technology to improve guest experiences and improve our back-office systems, including without limitation, our Opensalon mobile application and platform that we launched in 2019 and our Opensalon Pro salon management system that we launched in August 2020. These investments might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired return and could expose us to additional legal and compliance risks. Furthermore, some of our technology capabilities and developments involve third-party partnerships that we are dependent on. If these partnerships are unsuccessful, the technology-enabled capabilities may not fully achieve their anticipated returns. In addition, if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property rights resulting from our investments, the value received from those investments may be eroded, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Among other things, targeting the wrong investment opportunities, failing to successfully meet our strategic objectives when making the correct investments, being unable to make new concepts scalable or achieving appropriate market or franchisee adoption, and/or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPremature termination of franchise agreements can cause losses.\nOur franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances, such as failure of a franchisee to cure a default, monetary or otherwise, a franchisee bankruptcy, voluntary termination, or abandonment of the franchise. If terminations occur for these or other reasons, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims, which could cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses and/or to take back and operate such salons as company-owned salons. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the franchise agreement. In addition, with many of our brands, we remain liable under the lease and, therefore, will be obligated to pay rent or enter into a settlement with the landlord, and we may not be made whole by the franchisee. A significant loss of franchisee agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business.\nEmpire Education Group may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell to the other owner our 55% ownership stake in Empire Education Group (EEG), an operator of accredited cosmetology schools. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval before it can close, and there is no guarantee that the regulatory approval will occur, which has been delayed, in part, due to COVID-19. Due to poor financial performance of EEG, we fully impaired the investment in prior years. If the transaction does not close as anticipated and EEG is unsuccessful in executing its business plan, or if economic, regulatory and other factors, including declines in enrollment, revenue and profitability continue for the for-profit secondary education market, our financial results may be affected by certain potential liabilities related to this investment. The transaction is expected to close in fiscal year 2022, at which time we expect to record an immaterial non-operating gain.\nFailure to control costs may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our cost of product, labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating lease costs, other store expenses, or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving increased profitability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are not able to successfully compete in our business markets, our financial results may be affected.\nCompetition on a market-by-market basis remains challenging as many smaller chain competitors are franchise systems with local operating strength in certain markets and the hair salon industry, as a whole, is fragmented and highly competitive for customers, stylists and prime locations. Therefore, our ability to attract guests, raise prices and secure suitable locations in certain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition. Our strategies for competing are complicated by the fact that we have multiple brands in multiple segments, which compete on different factors. We also face significant competition for prime real estate, particularly in strip malls. We compete for lease locations not only with other hair salons, but with a wide variety of businesses looking for similar square footage and high-quality locations. If we are unable to successfully compete, we may lose market share and our ability to grow same-store sales and increase our revenue and earnings may be impaired.\nCorporate Structure and Governance Risks\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of key personnel, including our management team and others throughout our Company. We are also dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, for whom we compete with other companies both inside and outside our industry. We may be required to increase wages and/or benefits to attract and retain qualified personnel or risk considerable turnover. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted by the unexpected loss of any of our management team or other key personnel, or more generally if we fail to identify, recruit, train and/or retain talented personnel. In addition, our business may be harmed if we lose too many individuals with institutional knowledge.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent or detect material misstatement due to fraud, which could reduce investor confidence and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be materially misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies from occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, reduce investor confidence, cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns, payroll taxes and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and payroll tax accruals. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these examinations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and employment taxes. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period or periods where that determination is made. Also, in the future, our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or the outcome of income examinations.\nLitigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation, proceedings or claims, including possible fines and penalties, could have an adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may be inadequate to cover actual losses.\nFrom time-to-time in the ordinary course of our business operations, we are subject to litigation, including potential class action and single-plaintiff litigation, arbitration and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could require significant time commitments from our management team and result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which may cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and revenues. We establish accruals for potential liabilities arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liabilities are probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter or in the aggregate. Any resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings as well as claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition or revenues.", "PERMNO": 76711, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "RGS"}
