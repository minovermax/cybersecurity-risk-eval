You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISK FACTORS SUMMARY\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Below please find a summary of the principal risks we face. These risks are discussed more fully below.\n\u2022\nOur ability to develop, manufacture and obtain required regulatory approvals for a car of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale is unproven.\n\u2022\nWe are substantially reliant on our relationships with OEMs, suppliers and service providers for the parts and components in our vehicles, as well as for the manufacture of our initial vehicles. If any of these OEMs, suppliers or service partners choose to not do business with us, then we would have significant difficulty in procuring and producing our vehicles and our business prospects would be significantly harmed.\n\u2022\nOur relationship with one or more OEMs and automotive suppliers is integral to our platform procurement and manufacturing plan, but we do not have any binding commitments from an OEM or automotive supplier to participate in a platform sharing arrangement or manufacturing activities and we may not be able to obtain such commitments. We therefore are seeking alternative arrangements with a number of OEMs, component suppliers, and manufacturers, which we may not be successful in obtaining.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to contract with OEMs or suppliers on platform sharing and manufacturing of our vehicles, we would need to develop our own platform and manufacturing facilities, which may not be feasible and, if feasible at all, would significantly increase our capital expenditure and would significantly delay production of our vehicles.\n\u2022\nManufacturing in collaboration with partners is subject to risks.\n\u2022\nThere are complex software and technology systems that need to be developed in coordination with vendors and suppliers in order to reach production for our electric vehicles, and there can be no assurance such systems will be successfully developed.\n\u2022\nWe may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture, regulatory approval, launch and financing of our vehicles, which could harm our business and prospects.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner and at prices and volumes acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results.\n\u2022\nIf any of our suppliers become economically distressed or go bankrupt, we may be required to provide substantial financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of components or materials, which could increase our costs, affect our liquidity or cause production disruptions.\n\u2022\nOur vehicles will make use of lithium-ion\nbattery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.\n\u2022\nWe have a limited operating history and face significant challenges as a new entrant into the automotive industry. Fisker vehicles are in development and we do not expect our first vehicle to be produced until the fourth quarter of 2022, at the earliest, if at all.\n\u2022\nWe are an early stage company with a history of losses, and expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nOur EMaaS business model has yet to be tested and any failure to commercialize our strategic plans would have an adverse effect on our operating results and business, harm our reputation and could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\n\u2022\nOur operating and financial results forecast relies in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions or analyses prove to be incorrect, our actual operating results may be materially different from our forecasted results.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the supply and demand for our vehicles, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our business and hinder our ability to generate revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience delays.\n\u2022\nWe could experience cost increases or disruptions in supply of raw materials or other components used in our vehicles. If we are unable to establish an arrangement for the sustainable supply of batteries for our vehicles, our business would be materially and adversely harmed.\n\u2022\nIf our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market, and sell or lease our electric vehicles could be harmed.\n\u2022\nOur services may not be generally accepted by our users. If we are unable to provide quality customer service, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022\nThe automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry.\n\u2022\nThe automotive industry and its technology are rapidly evolving and may be subject to unforeseen changes. Developments in alternative technologies, including but not limited to hydrogen, may adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles.\n\u2022\nReservations for our vehicles are cancellable.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to risks associated with autonomous driving technology.\n\u2022\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which we may apply. As a result, our business and prospects may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nInsufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nOur distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult.\n\u2022\nWe may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.\n\u2022\nWe will initially depend on revenue generated from a single model and in the foreseeable future will be significantly dependent on a limited number of models.\n\u2022\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Henrik Fisker, our Chief Executive Officer.\n\u2022\nOur business plans require a significant amount of capital. In addition, our future capital needs may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities that may dilute our stockholders or introduce covenants that may restrict our operations or our ability to pay dividends.\n\u2022\nFailure of information security and privacy concerns could subject us to penalties, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impact our ability to effectively provide our services.\n\u2022\nWe face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics, including the recent COVID 19 pandemic, and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\n\u2022\nOur patent applications may not issue as patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 former employers.\n\u2022\nOur vehicles are subject to motor vehicle standards and the failure to satisfy such mandated safety standards would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and unfavorable changes to, or our failure to comply with, these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\n\u2022\nThe dual class structure of our Common Stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with Henrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta, our co-founders, members of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\n\u2022\nHenrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta are married to each other. The separation or divorce of the couple in the future could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders and future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industries\nOur ability to develop, manufacture and obtain required regulatory approvals for a car of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale is unproven.\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell or lease our electric vehicles. Initially, we plan to manufacture vehicles in collaboration with one or more automotive component and engineering services suppliers, including large original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) or tier-one\nautomotive suppliers. We recently entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Magna, an industry-leading OEM, but we have not yet executed definitive supply or manufacturing agreements with any OEM or tier-one\nautomotive supplier for the supply of parts for production of the Fisker Ocean, or any of our other future vehicle offerings. If we are unable to negotiate and finalize such supply and manufacturing agreements with an OEM or a tier-one\nautomotive supplier, we will not be able to produce any vehicles and will not be able to generate any revenue, or the vehicles may become more expensive to deliver with a higher bill of materials, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nThe continued development and the ability to start manufacturing our vehicles, including the Fisker Ocean, are and will be subject to risks, including with respect to:\n\u2022\nOur ability to secure necessary funding;\n\u2022\nOur ability to negotiate and execute definitive agreements with our various suppliers for hardware, software, or services necessary to engineer or manufacture our vehicles;\n\u2022\nOur ability to accurately manufacture vehicles within specified design tolerances;\n\u2022\nobtaining required regulatory approvals and certifications;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental, safety, and similar regulations;\n\u2022\nsecuring necessary components, services, or licenses on acceptable terms and in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndelays by us in delivering final component designs to our suppliers;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract, recruit, hire, retain and train skilled employees;\n\u2022\nquality controls that prove to be ineffective or inefficient;\n\u2022\ndelays or disruptions in our supply chain including raw material supplies;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain arrangements on reasonable terms with its manufacturing partners and suppliers, engineering service providers, delivery partners, and after sales service providers; and\n\u2022\nother delays, backlog in manufacturing and research and development of new models, and cost overruns.\nOur ability to develop, manufacture and obtain required regulatory approvals for a vehicle of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale is unproven, and the business plan is still evolving. We may be required to introduce new vehicle models and enhanced versions of existing models. To date, we have limited experience, as a company, designing, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling or leasing our electric vehicles and therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to meet customer expectations. Any failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are substantially reliant on our relationships with OEMs, suppliers and service providers for the parts and components in our vehicles, as well as for the manufacture of our initial vehicles. If any of these OEMs, suppliers or service partners choose to not do business with us, then we would have significant difficulty in procuring and producing our vehicles and our business prospects would be significantly harmed.\nWe have entered into a number of non-binding\nagreements with third parties in order to implement our asset-light business model and will need to enter into definitive agreements with one or more OEMs and suppliers in order to produce the Fisker Ocean and other vehicles in a manner contemplated by our business plan. Furthermore, we have explored and intend to secure alternative suppliers and providers for many of the most material aspects of our business model.\nCollaboration with third parties for the manufacturing of vehicles is subject to risks with respect to operations that are outside our control. We could experience delays to the extent our current or future partners do not continue doing business with us, meet agreed upon timelines, experience capacity constraints or otherwise are unable to deliver components or manufacture vehicles as expected. There is risk of potential disputes with partners, and we could be affected by adverse publicity related to our partners whether or not such publicity is related to their collaboration with us. Our ability to successfully build a premium brand could also be adversely affected by perceptions about the quality of our partners\u2019 vehicles or other vehicles manufactured by the same partner. In addition, although we intend to be involved in material decisions in the supply chain and manufacturing process, given that we also rely on our partners to meet our quality standards, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain high quality standards.\nWe may in the future enter into strategic alliances, including joint ventures or minority equity investments, with various third parties to further our business purpose. These alliances could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance\nby the third party, and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nTo sell or lease Fisker vehicles as currently contemplated, we will need to enter into certain additional agreements and arrangements that are not currently in place. These include entering into definitive agreements with third party service partners for fleet management, vehicle storage, dockside collection, mobile fleet servicing, financing and end of lease collections. If we are unable to enter into such definitive agreements, or if we are only able to do so on terms that are unfavorable to us, we may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nOur relationship with one or more OEMs and automotive suppliers is integral to our platform procurement and manufacturing plan, but we do not have any binding commitments from an OEM or automotive supplier to participate in a platform sharing arrangement or manufacturing activities and we may not be able to obtain such commitments. We therefore are seeking alternative arrangements with a number of OEMs, component suppliers, and manufacturers, which we may not be successful in obtaining.\nTo manufacture our vehicles as currently contemplated, we will need to enter into definitive agreements and arrangements that are not currently in place. Although we (i) have recently entered into a Collaborative Agreement with Magna setting forth certain terms for the development of a full electric vehicle and (ii) have a historic working relationship with VW to source the Modularer E-Antriebs-Baukasten (\u201cMEB\u201d) platform, including the Fisker Ocean prototype built on the MEB platform by IDG, we do not have a definitive agreement with Magna, VW or any other OEM to use a platform and commercially manufacture our vehicles, and as a result, we may not be able to implement our business strategy in the timeframe anticipated, or at all. If we are unable to enter into definitive agreements or are only able to do so on terms that are unfavorable to us, we may not be able to timely identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, and consequently, we may not be able to fully carry out our business plans. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on our statements about our production plans or their feasibility in the timeframe anticipated, or at all.\nIf we are unable to contract with OEMs or suppliers on platform sharing and manufacturing of our vehicles, we would need to develop our own platform and manufacturing facilities, which may not be feasible and, if feasible at all, would significantly increase our capital expenditure and would significantly delay production of our vehicles.\nWe may be unable to enter into definitive agreements with OEMs and suppliers for platform sharing and manufacturing on terms and conditions acceptable to us and therefore we may need to contract with other third parties or establish our own production capacity. There can be no assurance that in such event that we would be able to partner with other third parties or establish our own production capacity to meet our needs on acceptable terms, or at all. The expense and time required to complete any transition and to assure that vehicles manufactured at facilities of new third-party partners comply with our quality standards and regulatory requirements would likely be greater than currently anticipated. If we need to develop our own manufacturing and production capabilities, which may not be feasible, it would significantly increase our capital expenditures and would significantly delay production of our vehicles. This may require that we attempt to raise or borrow money, which may not be successful. Also, it may require that we change the anticipated pricing of our vehicles, which would adversely affect our margins and cash flows. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nManufacturing in collaboration with partners is subject to risks.\nOur business model relies on outsourced manufacturing of our vehicles. The cost of tooling a manufacturing facility with a collaboration partner is high, but such cost will not be known until we enter into a vehicle manufacturing agreement. Collaboration with third parties to manufacture vehicles is subject to risks that are outside of our control. We could experience delays if our partners do not meet agreed upon timelines or experience capacity constraints. There is risk of potential disputes with partners, which could stop or slow vehicle production, and we could be affected by adverse publicity related to our partners, whether or not such\npublicity is related to such third parties\u2019 collaboration with us. Our ability to successfully build a premium brand could also be adversely affected by perceptions about the quality of our partners\u2019 products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will not deviate from agreed-upon quality standards.\nWe may be unable to enter into agreements with manufacturers on terms and conditions acceptable to us and therefore we may need to contract with other third parties or significantly add to our own production capacity. We may not be able to engage other third parties or establish or expand our own production capacity to meet our needs on acceptable terms, or at all. The expense and time required to adequately complete any transition may be greater than anticipated. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThere are complex software and technology systems that need to be developed in coordination with vendors and suppliers in order to reach production for our electric vehicles, and there can be no assurance such systems will be successfully developed.\nFisker vehicles will use a substantial amount of third-party and in-house\nsoftware codes and complex hardware to operate. The development of such advanced technologies are inherently complex, and we will need to coordinate with our vendors and suppliers in order to reach production for our electric vehicles. Defects and errors may be revealed over time and our control over the performance of third-party services and systems may be limited. Thus, our potential inability to develop the necessary software and technology systems may harm our competitive position.\nWe are relying on third-party suppliers to develop a number of emerging technologies for use in our products, including lithium ion battery technology. These technologies are not today, and may not ever be, commercially viable. There can be no assurances that our suppliers will be able to meet the technological requirements, production timing, and volume requirements to support our business plan. In addition, the technology may not comply with the cost, performance useful life and warranty characteristics we anticipate in our business plan. As a result, our business plan could be significantly impacted and we may incur significant liabilities under warranty claims which could adversely affect our business, prospects, and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture, regulatory approval, launch and financing of our vehicles, which could harm our business and prospects.\nAny delay in the financing, design, manufacture, regulatory approval or launch of our vehicles, including entering into agreements for platform sharing, supply of component parts, and manufacturing, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results and could cause liquidity constraints. Vehicle manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture and commercial release of new products. To the extent we delay the launch of our vehicles, our growth prospects could be adversely affected as we may fail to establish or grow our market share. We rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of the key components and materials used in our vehicles. To the extent our suppliers experience any delays in providing us with or developing necessary components, we could experience delays in delivering on our timelines.\nPrior to mass production of the Fisker Ocean, we will need the vehicle to be fully designed and engineered and be approved for sale according to differing requirements, including but not limited to regulatory requirements, in the different geographies we intend to launch our vehicles. If we encounter delays in any of these matters, we may consequently delay our deliveries of the Fisker Ocean.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner and at prices and volumes acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects and operating results.\nWhile we plan to obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, many of the components used in our vehicles will be purchased by us from a single source. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term (or at all) at prices or quality levels that are acceptable to us. In addition, we could experience delays if our suppliers do not meet agreed upon timelines or experience capacity constraints.\nAny disruption in the supply of components, whether or not from a single source supplier, could temporarily disrupt production of our vehicles until an alternative supplier is able to supply the required material. Changes in business conditions, unforeseen circumstances, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf any of our suppliers become economically distressed or go bankrupt, we may be required to provide substantial financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of components or materials, which could increase our costs, affect our liquidity or cause production disruptions.\nWe expect to purchase various types of equipment, raw materials and manufactured component parts from our suppliers. If these suppliers experience substantial financial difficulties, cease operations, or otherwise face business disruptions, we may be required to provide substantial financial support to ensure supply continuity or would have to take other measures to ensure components and materials remain available. Any disruption could affect our ability to deliver vehicles and could increase our costs and negatively affect our liquidity and financial performance.\nOur vehicles will make use of lithium-ion\nbattery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.\nThe battery packs within our vehicles will make use of lithium-ion\ncells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion\ncells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion\ncells. While the battery pack is designed to contain any single cell\u2019s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, once our vehicles are commercially available, a field or testing failure of battery packs in our vehicles could occur, which could result in bodily injury or death and could subject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive and could harm our brand image. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion\ncells for automotive applications, the social and environmental impacts of cobalt mining, or any future incident involving lithium-ion\ncells, such as a vehicle or other fire, could seriously harm our business and reputation.\nWe have a limited operating history and faces significant challenges as a new entrant into the automotive industry. Fisker vehicles are in development and we do not expect our first vehicle to be produced until the fourth quarter of 2022, at the earliest, if at all.\nFisker was incorporated in September 2016 and we have a short operating history in the automobile industry, which is continuously evolving. We have no experience as an organization in high volume manufacturing of the planned electric vehicles. We cannot assure you that we or our partners will be able to develop efficient, automated, cost-efficient manufacturing capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supplies that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards,\nas well as the production volumes, required to successfully mass market the Fisker Ocean and future vehicles. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and significant challenges we face as a new entrant into our industry, including, among other things, with respect to our ability to:\n\u2022\ndesign and produce safe, reliable and quality vehicles on an ongoing basis;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nbuild a well-recognized and respected brand;\n\u2022\nestablish and expand our customer base;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully market not just our vehicles but also our other services, including our Flexee lease and other services we intend to provide;\n\u2022\nproperly price our services, including our charging solutions, financing and lease options, and successfully anticipate the take-rate and usage of such services by users;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully service our vehicles after sales and maintain a good flow of spare parts and customer goodwill;\n\u2022\nimprove and maintain our operational efficiency;\n\u2022\nmaintain a reliable, secure, high-performance and scalable technology infrastructure;\n\u2022\npredict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses;\n\u2022\nattract, retain and motivate talented employees;\n\u2022\nanticipate trends that may emerge and affect our business;\n\u2022\nanticipate and adapt to changing market conditions, including technological developments and changes in competitive landscape; and\n\u2022\nnavigate an evolving and complex regulatory environment.\nIf we fail to adequately address any or all of these risks and challenges, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are an early stage company with a history of losses, and expects to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred a net loss since our inception. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of our vehicles. Even if we are able to successfully develop and sell or lease our vehicles, there can be no assurance that we will be commercially successful.\nWe expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be significantly higher in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture our vehicles; build up inventories of parts and components for our vehicles; increase our sales and marketing activities, including opening new Fisker Experience Centers; develop our distribution infrastructure; and increases our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. We may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenues, which would further increase our losses.\nOur EMaaS business model has yet to be tested and any failure to commercialize our strategic plans would have an adverse effect on our operating results and business, harm our reputation and could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nInvestors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by a new enterprise, many of which are beyond our control, including substantial risks and expenses while establishing or entering new markets, setting\nup operations and undertaking marketing activities. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of these risks, expenses, complications, delays, and the competitive environment in which we operate. There is, therefore, nothing at this time upon which to base an assumption that our EMaaS business model will prove successful, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue, raise additional capital or operate profitably. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early commercial stage companies, including scaling up our infrastructure and headcount, and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties or delays in connection with our growth. In addition, as a result of the capital-intensive nature of our business, it can be expected to continue to sustain substantial operating expenses without generating sufficient revenues to cover expenditures. Any investment in our\u2019 company is therefore highly speculative and could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nOur operating and financial results forecast relies in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by Fisker. If these assumptions or analyses prove to be incorrect, Fisker\u2019s actual operating results may be materially different from its forecasted results.\nThe projected financial and operating information appearing elsewhere in this report reflect current estimates of future performance. Whether actual operating and financial results and business developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions as reflected in our forecast depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nwhether we can obtain sufficient capital to sustain and grow our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage its growth;\n\u2022\nwhether we can manage relationships with key suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs of new and existing marketing and promotional efforts;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including from established and future competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain existing key management, to integrate recent hires and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe overall strength and stability of domestic and international economies;\n\u2022\nregulatory, legislative and political changes; and\n\u2022\nconsumer spending habits.\nUnfavorable changes in any of these or other factors, most of which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the supply and demand for our vehicles, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our business and hinder our ability to generate revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience delays.\nIt is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. We will be required to provide forecasts of our demand to our suppliers several months prior to the scheduled delivery of products to our prospective customers. Currently, there is no historical basis for making judgments on the demand for our vehicles or our ability to develop, manufacture, and deliver vehicles, or our profitability in the future. If we overestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have excess inventory, which indirectly would increase our costs. If we underestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt\nmanufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues. In addition, lead times for materials and components that our suppliers order may vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. If we fail to order sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, the delivery of vehicles to our customers could be delayed, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe could experience cost increases or disruptions in supply of raw materials or other components used in our vehicles. If we are unable to establish an arrangement for the sustainable supply of batteries for our vehicles, our business would be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant costs related to procuring raw materials required to manufacture and assemble our vehicles. We expect to use various raw materials in our vehicles including, steel, recycled rubber, recycled polyester, carpeting from fishing nets and bottles recycled from ocean waste. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control. Our business also depends on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles. We are exposed to multiple risks relating to availability and pricing of quality lithium-ion\nbattery cells.\nFurthermore, currency fluctuations, tariffs or shortages in petroleum and other economic or political conditions may result in significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins. In addition, a growth in popularity of electric vehicles without a significant expansion in battery cell production capacity could result in shortages, which would result in increased costs in raw materials to us or impact of prospects.\nOur limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment.\nYou must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early stage company with a limited operating history. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. We have a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business, operating results and prospects. It is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected. The projected financial information appearing elsewhere in this report was prepared by management and reflects current estimates of future performance.\nIf our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market, and sell or lease our electric vehicles could be harmed.\nOnce production commences, our vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair, recalls, and design changes. Our vehicles will use a substantial amount of software code to operate and software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced. We have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our systems and vehicles. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. If any of our vehicles fail to perform as expected, we may need to delay deliveries or initiate product recalls, which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects, and results of operations.\nOur services may not be generally accepted by our users. If we are unable to provide quality customer service, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur servicing may primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, they will initially have limited experience in servicing\nFisker vehicles. There can be no assurance that our service arrangements will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we and our partners will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles Fisker deliver increases.\nIn addition, if we are unable to roll out and establish a widespread service network that complies with applicable laws, user satisfaction could be adversely affected, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our reputation and thus our sales, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry.\nBoth the automobile industry generally, and the electric vehicle segment in particular, are highly competitive, and we will be competing for sales with both ICE vehicles and other EVs. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of our products, including our electric vehicles. We expect competition for electric vehicles to intensify due to increased demand and a regulatory push for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization, and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service, and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nThe automotive industry and its technology are rapidly evolving and may be subject to unforeseen changes. Developments in alternative technologies, including but not limited to hydrogen, may adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles.\nWe may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology or alternatives to electricity as a fuel source and, as a result, our competitiveness may suffer. Developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells, or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the ICE, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to successfully react to changes in existing technologies could materially harm our competitive position and growth prospects.\nReservations for our vehicles are cancellable.\nDeposits paid to reserve the Fisker Ocean SUVs are cancellable by the customer until the customer enters into a lease or purchase agreement. Because all of our reservations are cancellable, it is possible that a significant number of customers who submitted reservations for the Fisker Ocean may not purchase vehicles.\nThe potentially long wait from the time a reservation is made until the time the vehicle is delivered, and any delays beyond expected wait times, could also impact user decisions on whether to ultimately make a purchase. Any cancellations could harm our financial condition, business, prospects, and operating results.\nWe may be subject to risks associated with autonomous driving technology.\nOur vehicles will be designed with connectivity for future installation of an autonomous hardware suite and our plans to partner with a third-party software provider in the future to implement autonomous capabilities. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify a third party to provide the necessary hardware and software to enable autonomous capabilities in an acceptable timeframe, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Autonomous driving technologies are subject to risks and there have been accidents and fatalities associated with such technologies. The safety of such technologies depends in part on drive interactions, and drivers may not be accustomed to using or adapting to such technologies. To the extent accidents associated with our autonomous\ndriving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, negative publicity, government scrutiny, and further regulation. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur future growth is dependent on the demand for, and upon consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt, electric vehicles.\nOur future growth is dependent on the demand for, and upon consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt electric vehicles, and even if electric vehicles become more mainstream, consumers choosing us over other EV manufacturers. Demand for electric vehicles may be affected by factors directly impacting automobile prices or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, the demand for our vehicles and services will highly depend upon the adoption by consumers of new energy vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. The market for new energy vehicles is still rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, competitive pricing and competitive factors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, and changing consumer demands and behaviors.\n\u2022\nOther factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include:\n\u2022\nperceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety, design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles, whether or not such vehicles are produced by us or other manufacturers;\n\u2022\nrange anxiety;\n\u2022\nthe availability of new energy vehicles, including plug-in\nhybrid electric vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe availability of service and charging stations for electric vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe environmental consciousness of consumers, and their adoption of EVs;\n\u2022\nperceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel; and\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic factors.\nAny of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase electric vehicles in general, and Fisker electric vehicles in particular. If the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develop more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be affected.\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny reduction, elimination, or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, or the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle or other reasons, may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel and electric vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWhile certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production, alternative fuel and electric vehicles have been available in the past, there is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future. If current tax incentives are not available in the future, our financial position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which it may apply. As a result, our business and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe may apply for federal and state grants, loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of alternative fuel and electric vehicles and related technologies. We anticipate that in the future there will be new opportunities for it to apply for grants, loans and other incentives from the United States, state and foreign governments. Our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The application process for these funds and other incentives will likely be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that it will be successful in obtaining any of these additional grants, loans and other incentives. If we are not successful in obtaining any of these additional incentives and we are unable to find alternative sources of funding to meet our planned capital needs, our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our future growth effectively, we may not be able to market and sell or lease our vehicles successfully.\nWe intend to expand our operations significantly, which will require hiring, retaining and training new personnel, controlling expenses, establishing facilities and experience centers, and implementing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes. In addition, because our electric vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional ICE vehicles, individuals with sufficient training in electric vehicles may not be available to be hired, and we will need to expend significant time and expense training employees it hires. We also require sufficient talent in additional areas such as software development. Furthermore, as we are a relatively young company, our ability to train and integrate new employees into its operations may not meet the growing demands of our business which may affect our ability to grow. Any failure to effectively manage our growth could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nInsufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOnce our cars are in production, it will need to maintain warranty reserves to cover warranty-related claims. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses. There can be no assurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims.\nWe may not succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening our brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of its vehicles and components and its business, revenues and prospects.\nOur business and prospects heavily depend on its ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Fisker brand. If we are not able to establish, maintain and strengthen its brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Fisker brand will depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening its brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in the United States, Japan, the European Union and China, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult.\nOur distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult. Our distribution model is not common in the automotive industry today. Our plans to conduct vehicle sales directly to users rather than through dealerships, primarily through its Flexee App and Fisker Experience Centers. This model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and, with limited exceptions, unproven, and subjects us to substantial risk. For example, we will not be able to utilize long established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase sales volume. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well established distribution channels. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. If we are unable to achieve this, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial results and results of operations. There are substantial automotive franchise laws in place in many geographies in the world and we might be exposed to significant franchise dealer litigation risks.\nWe may face regulatory limitations on its ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell its electric vehicles.\nSome states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer\nsales model. The application of these state laws to our operations may be difficult to predict. Laws in some states may limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators.\nIn addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our anticipated sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or dealerships that we can operate.\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will initially depend on revenue generated from a single model and in the foreseeable future will be significantly dependent on a limited number of models.\nWe will initially depend on revenue generated from a single vehicle model and in the foreseeable future will be significantly dependent on a limited number of models. Historically, automobile customers have come to expect a variety of vehicle models offered in a manufacturer\u2019s fleet and new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. Given that for the foreseeable future our business will depend on a single or limited number of models, to the extent a particular model is not well-received by the market, our sales volume, business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nDoing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business.\nOur business plan includes operations in international markets, including initial manufacturing and supply activities in Europe, initial sales in North America and Europe, and eventual expansion into other international markets. Conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources. If Fisker fails to\ncoordinate and manage these activities effectively, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. International sales entail a variety of risks, including currency exchange fluctuations, challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, tariffs and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which Fisker sells its products and services, difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other trade barriers, laws and business practices favoring local companies, political and economic instability, difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights, and restrictions resulting in delivery delays and significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws.\nFisker is highly dependent on the services of Henrik Fisker, its Chief Executive Officer.\nFisker is highly dependent on the services of Henrik Fisker, its co-founder\nand Chief Executive Officer, and, together with his wife, its Chief Financial Officer, its largest stockholder. Mr. Fisker is the source of many, if not most, of the ideas and execution driving Fisker. If Mr. Fisker were to discontinue his service to Fisker due to death, disability or any other reason, Fisker would be significantly disadvantaged.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our executive officers, key employees and qualified personnel, and our operations may be severely disrupted if we lost their services.\nOur success depends substantially on the continued efforts of our executive officers, key employees and qualified personnel, and our operations may be severely disrupted if we lost their services. As we build our brand and becomes more well known, the risk that competitors or other companies may poach our talent increases. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these personnel could seriously harm our business and prospects.\nOur business may be adversely affected by labor and union activities.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. We may also directly and indirectly depend upon other companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19\npandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the recent pandemic of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19.\nThe impact of COVID-19,\nincluding changes in consumer and business behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy and led to reduced economic activity. The spread of COVID-19\nhas also created a disruption in the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, and has led to a global decrease in vehicle sales in markets around the world.\nThe pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home\nor shelter-in-place\norders, and business shutdowns. For example, employees at our headquarters located in Manhattan Beach, California, are currently subject to a stay-at-home\norder from the state government. These measures may adversely impact our employees and operations and the operations of its customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners, and may negatively impact our sales and marketing activities. In addition, various aspects of our business cannot be conducted remotely. These measures by government authorities may remain in place for a significant period of time and they are likely to continue to adversely affect our manufacturing plans, sales and marketing activities, business and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19\nhas caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, recommending that all non-essential\npersonnel work from home and cancellation or reduction of physical participation in sales activities, meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine is in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners. There is no certainty that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, social distancing, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, our operations will be impacted.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic impacts our business, prospects and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activities can resume. Even after the COVID-19\npandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to its business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nSpecifically, difficult macroeconomic conditions, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income, increased and prolonged unemployment, or a decline in consumer confidence as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our vehicles. Under difficult economic conditions, potential customers may seek to reduce spending by forgoing our vehicles for other traditional options or may choose to keep their existing vehicles, and cancel reservations.\nThere are no comparable recent events that may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19\nand a pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19\npandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain.\nOur business plans require a significant amount of capital. In addition, our future capital needs may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities that may dilute our stockholders or introduce covenants that may restrict our operations or our ability to pay dividends.\nWe expect our capital expenditures to continue to be significant in the foreseeable future as it expands our business, and that our level of capital expenditures will be significantly affected by user demand for our products and services. The fact that we have a limited operating history means we have limited historical data on the demand for our products and services. As a result, our future capital requirements may be uncertain and actual capital requirements may be different from those it currently anticipates. We may need to seek equity or debt financing to finance a portion of our capital expenditures. Such financing might not be available to us in a timely manner or on terms that are acceptable, or at all.\nOur ability to obtain the necessary financing to carry out our business plan is subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions and investor acceptance of our EMaaS business model. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of such financing unattractive or unavailable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we will have to significantly reduce our spending, delay or cancel our planned activities or substantially change our corporate structure. We might not be able to obtain any funding, and we might not have sufficient resources to conduct our business as projected, both of which could mean that we would be forced to curtail or discontinue our operations.\nIn addition, our future capital needs and other business reasons could require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could dilute our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations or our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIf we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\nFailure of information security and privacy concerns could subject us to penalties, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe expect to face significant challenges with respect to information security and privacy, including the storage, transmission and sharing of confidential information. We will transmit and store confidential and private information of our customers, such as personal information, including names, accounts, user IDs and passwords, and payment or transaction related information.\nWe have adopted strict information security policies and deployed advanced measures to implement the policies, including, among others, advanced encryption technologies, and plans to continue to deploy additional measurers as we grow. However, advances in technology, an increased level of sophistication and diversity of our products and services, an increased level of expertise of hackers, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or others can still result in a compromise or breach of the measures that it uses. If we are unable to protect our systems, and hence the information stored in our systems, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction, such problems or security breaches could cause a loss, give rise to our liabilities to the owners of confidential information or even subject it to fines and penalties. In addition, complying with various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require it to change our business practices, including our data practices, in a manner adverse to our business.\nIn addition, we will need to comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018 and the State of California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under the GDPR) and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks.\nCompliance with any additional laws and regulations could be expensive, and may place restrictions on the conduct of our business and the manner in which we interact with our customers. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations could also result in regulatory enforcement actions against us, and misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, and damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nSignificant capital and other resources may be required to protect against information security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches or to comply with our privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations. The resources required may increase over time as the methods used by hackers and others engaged in online criminal activities are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. Any failure or perceived failure by us to prevent information security breaches or to comply with privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, could cause our customers to lose trust in us and could expose us to legal claims. Any perception by the public that online transactions or the privacy of user information are becoming increasingly unsafe or vulnerable to attacks could inhibit the growth of online retail and other online services generally, which may reduce the number of orders we receive.\nWe retain certain information about our users and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws.\nWe intend to use our vehicles\u2019 electronic systems to log information about each vehicle\u2019s use, such as charge time, battery usage, mileage and driving behavior, in order to aid us in vehicle diagnostics, repair and maintenance, as well as to help us customize and optimize the driving and riding experience. Our users may object to the use of this data, which may harm our business. Possession and use of our users\u2019 driving behavior and data in conducting our business may subject us to legislative and regulatory burdens in the United States and other jurisdictions that could require notification of any data breach, restrict our use of such information, and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers. If users allege that we have improperly released or disclosed their personal information, we could face legal claims and reputational damage. We may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy, consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations. If third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our users, we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve these problems.\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles\u2019 systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business.\nOur vehicles will contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles will be outfitted with built-in\ndata connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of our vehicles. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent cybersecurity breaches or unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our vehicles and their systems, and intends to implement additional security measures as necessary. However, hackers may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, vehicles and systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles\u2019 functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Vulnerabilities could be identified in the future and our remediation efforts may not be successful. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles, their systems or data are capable of being \u201chacked,\u201d could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impact our ability to effectively provide our services.\nWe plan to outfit our vehicles with in-vehicle\nservices and functionality that utilize data connectivity to monitor performance and timely capture opportunities for cost-saving preventative maintenance. The availability and effectiveness of our services depend on the continued operation of information technology and communications systems, which we have yet to develop. Our systems will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, fire, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Our data centers could also be subject to break-ins,\nsabotage and intentional acts of vandalism causing potential disruptions. Some of our systems will not be fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Any problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our vehicles are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in our business or the failure of our systems.\nWe face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\nOur facilities or operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars, health epidemics (as more fully described in the risk factor \u201cWe face risks related to health\nepidemics,\nincluding the recent COVID\npandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations\n\u201d located elsewhere in these Risk Factors), and other calamities. Although we have servers that are hosted in an offsite location, our backup system does not capture data on a real-time basis and we may be unable to recover certain data in the event of a server failure. We cannot assure you that any backup systems will be adequate to protect us from the effects of fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins,\nwar, riots, terrorist attacks or similar events. Any of the foregoing events may give rise to interruptions, breakdowns, system failures, technology platform failures or internet failures, which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware as well as adversely affect our ability to provide services.\nWe may need to defend us against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompanies, organizations, or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell, leasing or market our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive communications from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their rights and urge us to take licenses. Our applications and uses of trademarks relating to our design, software or artificial intelligence technologies could be found to infringe upon existing trademark ownership and rights. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or leasing, incorporating certain components into, or using vehicles or offering goods or services that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages;\n\u2022\nseek a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nredesign our vehicles or other goods or services; or\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how),\nemployee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, trademarks, intellectual property licenses, and other contractual rights to establish and protect our rights in its technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or seek court declarations that they do not infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and the steps we have taken or will take will prevent misappropriation. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.\nPatent, trademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world. A number of foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nTherefore, our intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the United States. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which, would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur patent applications may not issue as patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\nWe cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter to which we have filed a particular patent application, or if we are the first party to file such a patent application. If another party has filed a patent application for the same subject matter as we have, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application. Further, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, our competitors may design around our issued patents, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\nAs our patents may expire and may not be extended, our patent applications may not be granted and our patent rights may be contested, circumvented, invalidated or limited in scope, our patent rights may not protect it effectively. In particular, we may not be able to prevent others from developing or exploiting competing technologies, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be granted patents pursuant to our pending applications. Even if our patent applications succeed and we are issued patents in accordance with them, we are still uncertain whether these patents will be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with meaningful protection or competitive advantages. The claims under any patents that issue from our patent applications may not be broad enough to prevent others from developing technologies that are similar or that achieve results similar to ours. The intellectual property rights of others could also bar us from licensing and exploiting any patents that issue from our pending applications. Numerous patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the fields in which we have developed and are developing our technology. These patents and patent applications might have priority over our patent applications and could subject our patent applications to invalidation. Finally, in addition to those who may claim priority, any of our existing or pending patents may also be challenged by others on the basis that they are otherwise invalid or unenforceable.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed by other automotive companies or by suppliers to automotive companies. We may be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or our work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and demand on management resources.\nOur vehicles are subject to motor vehicle standards and the failure to satisfy such mandated safety standards would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAll vehicles sold must comply with international, federal, and state motor vehicle safety standards. In the United States, vehicles that meet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are certified under the federal\nregulations. Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. Failure by us to have the Fisker Ocean or any future model electric vehicle satisfy motor vehicle standards would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and unfavorable changes to, or our failure to comply with, these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nOur electric vehicles, and the sale of motor vehicles in general, are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We expect to incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations.\nTo the extent the laws change, our vehicles may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell or lease vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will face risks associated with potential international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business.\nWe will face risks associated with any potential international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We anticipate having international operations and subsidiaries that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. We have no experience to date selling or leasing and servicing our vehicles internationally and such expansion would require us to make significant expenditures, including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities, in advance of generating any revenue. We will be subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell or lease our EVs and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u2022\nconforming our vehicles to various international regulatory requirements where our vehicles are sold which requirements may change over time;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon it in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any foreign currency swap or other hedging activities we undertake;\n\u2022\nUnited States and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\n\u2022\nforeign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and\n\u2022\nthe strength of international economies.\nIf we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nOur business could be adversely affected by trade tariffs or other trade barriers.\nIn recent years, both China and the United States have each imposed tariffs indicating the potential for further trade barriers. These tariffs may escalate a nascent trade war between China and the United States. Tariffs could potentially impact our raw material prices and impact any plans to sell vehicles in China. In addition, these developments could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, even those without merit, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given it has limited field experience of our vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates, which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. Any insurance coverage might not be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy.\nWe are or will be subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws, and non-compliance\nwith such laws can subject us to administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nWe are or will be subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we conduct or in the future may conduct activities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. The FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to a \u201cforeign official\u201d for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. The U.K. Bribery Act also prohibits non-governmental\n\u201ccommercial\u201d bribery and soliciting or accepting bribes. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations may not be sufficient and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, and business partners could engage in improper conduct for which we may be held responsible.\nNon-compliance\nwith anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering or financial and economic sanctions laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition, changes in economic sanctions laws in the future could adversely impact our business and investments in its shares.\nWe may face legal challenges in one or more states attempting to sell or lease directly to customers which could materially adversely affect our costs.\nOur business model includes the direct sale of vehicles to individual customers. Most, if not all, states require a license to sell or lease vehicles within the state. Many states prohibit manufacturers from directly selling or leasing vehicles to customers. In other states, manufacturers must operate a physical dealership within the state to deliver vehicles to customers. As a result, we may not be able to sell or lease directly to customers in each state in the United States.\nWe are currently not registered as a dealer in any state. In many states, it is unclear if, as a manufacturer, we will be able to obtain permission to sell or lease and deliver vehicles directly to customers. For customers residing in states in which we will not be allowed to sell, lease or deliver vehicles, we may have to arrange alternate methods of delivery of vehicles. This could include delivering vehicles to adjacent or nearby states in which we are allowed to directly sell or lease and ship vehicles, and arranging for the customer to transport the vehicles to their home states. These workarounds could add significant complexity, and as a result, costs, to our business.\nWe will need to improve our operational and financial systems to support our expected growth, increasingly complex business arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition and any inability to do so will adversely affect our billing and reporting.\nTo manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we will need to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on manual operations. Any inability to do so will affect our billing and reporting. Our current and planned systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth. Delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, cause harm to our reputation and brand and could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting.\nWe may need to reclassify our warrants from stockholders\u2019 equity to a liability.\nFor purposes of preparing the Company\u2019s financial statements, we have accounted for our Public Warrants and Private Warrants as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit). Differences in accounting practice exist in the interpretation and application of accounting principles related to determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity\u2019s own stock, and the alternative view would result in the presentation of the fair value of the warrants as a liability that is subsequently remeasured through earnings. If the SEC disagrees with our interpretation whereby we treat our warrants as a component of stockholders equity, we may be required to restate our financial statements in this Annual Report to reclassify warrants from stockholders\u2019 equity to non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and to recognize a loss in our statement of operations. Accordingly, if this alternative method of accounting were applied it would have the effect of materially reducing our stockholder\u2019s equity and materially increasing our non-current liabilities and our losses in our statement of operations for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, a restatement of our financials could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls.\nFailure to build our finance infrastructure and improve our accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies.\nAs a public company, we will operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the regulations of the NYSE, the rules and regulations of the SEC, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. Commencing with our fiscal year ending the year after the Business Combination is completed, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Form 10-K\nfiling for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have never been required to test our internal controls within a specified period and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner.\nWe anticipate that the process of building our accounting and financial functions and infrastructure will require significant additional professional fees, internal costs and management efforts. We expect that we will need to implement a new internal system to combine and streamline the management of our financial, accounting, human resources and other functions. However, such a system would likely require us to complete many processes and procedures for the effective use of the system or to run our business using the system, which may result in substantial costs. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using such a system could adversely affect our controls and harm our business. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention. In addition, we may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a chosen judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation requires to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or, if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, another federal or state court situated in the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.\nIn March 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court issued a decision in Salzburg et al. v. Sciabacucchi\n, which found that an exclusive forum provision providing for claims under the Securities Act to be brought in federal court is facially valid under Delaware law. It is unclear whether this decision will be appealed, or what the final outcome of this case will be. We intend to enforce this provision, but we do not know whether courts in other jurisdictions will agree with this decision or enforce it.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business, operating results and financial condition.\nCharter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of Fisker. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control;\n\u2022\nMr. Fisker and Dr. Gupta hold sufficient voting power to control voting for election of directors and amend our Certificate of Incorporation;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies on its Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our Bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least two-thirds\nof the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) govern Fisker. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with Fisker for a certain period of time without the consent of its Board of Directors.\nThese and other provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Class A Common Stock and result in the market price of Class A Common Stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our Bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving Fisker in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful;\n\u2022\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n\u2022\nWe will be required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n\u2022\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our Bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against Fisker or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our Board of Directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification;\n\u2022\nthe rights conferred in our Bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n\u2022\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nOur management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nOur executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage our transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the combined company. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for the combined company to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the United States may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nThe dual class structure of our Common Stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with Henrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta, our co-founders,\nmembers of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nShares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (\u201cClass B Common Stock\u201d) have 10 votes per share, while shares of our Class A Common Stock have one vote per share. Henrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta, Fisker\u2019s co-founders,\nmembers of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock. Accordingly, Mr. Fisker and Dr. Gupta will hold approximately 92.2% of the voting power of Fisker\u2019s capital stock on an outstanding basis and will be able to control matters submitted to its stockholders for approval, including the election of directors,\namendments of its organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Mr. Fisker and Dr. Gupta may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of Fisker, could deprive its stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of Fisker, and might ultimately affect the market price of shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur dual class structure may depress the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A Common Stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500, pursuant to which companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock are excluded. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our Common Stock may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause Fisker to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices or any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could adversely affect the value and trading market of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules, and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies. To the extent we utilize any of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. We do not currently intend to rely on the exemptions afforded to controlled companies at this time.\nSo long as more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of Fisker is held by an individual, a group or another company, we will qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NYSE rules. Upon the completion of the Business Combination, Henrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta control a majority of the voting power of Fisker\u2019s outstanding capital stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NYSE rules. As a controlled company, we are be exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including those that would otherwise require our Board of Directors to have a majority of independent directors and require that we either establish compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or otherwise ensure that the compensation of our executive officers and nominees for directors are determined or recommended to the Board of Directors by the independent members of the Board of Directors. While we do not currently intend to rely on any of these exemptions, we will be entitled to do so for as long as we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d and to the extent we rely on one or more of these exemptions, holders of our capital stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nHenrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta are married to each other. The separation or divorce of the couple in the future could adversely affect our business.\nHenrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta, Fisker\u2019s co-founders,\nmembers of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, are married to each other. They are two of our executive officers and are a vital part of our operations. If they were to become separated or divorced or could otherwise not amicably work with each other, one or both of them may decide to cease his or her employment with Fisker or it could negatively impact our working environment. Alternatively, their work performance may not be satisfactory if they become preoccupied with issues relating to their personal situation. In these cases, our business could be materially harmed.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders and future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares of our Class A Common Stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. All outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock previously held by the pre-Business\nCombination public stockholders at the completion of the Merger and a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock issued as merger consideration in the Merger are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares of our Class A Common Stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which are subject to restrictions under the Securities Act.\nIn connection with the completion of the Merger, we entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement with our Former Sponsor, Spartan Energy Acquisition Sponsor LLC, Magna, Henrik Fisker, Dr. Geeta Gupta and certain former stockholders of Legacy Fisker, pursuant to which we agreed to register for resale and granted certain other registration rights with respect to certain shares of Class A Common Stock held by our Former Sponsor, Magna, Henrik Fisker and Dr Geeta Gupta and their respective permitted transferees, in addition to the warrants originally issued in a private placement to our Former Sponsor in connection with the Company\u2019s initial public offering and the up to 9.36 million shares of our Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants. We also registered for resale the 50 million shares of our Class A Common Stock (the \u201cPIPE shares\u201d) issued in a private placement that closed immediately prior to the Merger and the 18.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of our publicly held warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock. In accordance with the foregoing, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1\nunder the Securities Act, which registration statement was declared effective on December 12, 2020, to register the resale of up to 133.78 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, including 50 million PIPE shares and 18.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding publicly held warrants. Shares of Class A Common Stock sold under such registration statement can be freely sold in the public market. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have also filed a registration statement on Form S-8\nunder the Securities Act to register shares of our Class A Common Stock that may be issued under our equity incentive plans from time to time, as well as any shares of our Class A Common Stock underlying outstanding options and restricted stock units that have been granted to our directors, executive officers and other employees, all of which are subject to time-vesting conditions. Shares registered under this registration statement will be available for sale in the public market upon issuance subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options, as well as Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates.\nOur Former Sponsor and our former board members agreed not to transfer, assign or sell certain founder shares held by each of them until one year after the date of the Closing or earlier if, subsequent to the Business Combination, (i) the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading\nday period commencing at least 150 days after the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company\u2019s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common Stock for cash, securities or other property. However, following the expiration of such lock-up,\nthe Former Sponsor and its permitted transferees will not be restricted from selling such securities, other than by applicable securities laws.\nWe are unable to predict the effect that these sales, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A Common Stock. If holders of these shares sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline significantly and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change\nnet operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. The limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period. If we have experienced an ownership change at any time since our incorporation, we may already be subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our existing NOLs and other tax attributes to offset taxable income or tax liability. In addition, the Business Combination and future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, even if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to use our pre-change\nNOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income or tax liability may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us.\nChanges to applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew laws and policy relating to taxes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), and certain provisions of the Tax Act may adversely affect us. Changes under the Tax Act include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate income tax rate decrease to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017 and the elimination of carrybacks of net operating losses. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), which modified the Tax Act, U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. The Tax Act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, and is subject to interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and IRS, any of which could mitigate or increase certain adverse effects of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation. Generally, future changes in applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE could result in a delisting of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf, after listing, we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, the NYSE may take steps to delist our Class A Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Class A Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by it to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our Class A Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock, prevent our Class A Common Stock from dropping below the NYSE minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance\nwith NYSE\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Currently, we do not have any analyst coverage and may not\nobtain analyst coverage in the future. In the event we obtain analyst coverage, we will not have any control over such analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover Fisker downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Fisker company or fail to regularly publish reports on Fisker, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nThe issuance of shares of our Class A Common Stock upon exercise of our outstanding warrants would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of March 22, 2021, warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 10.66 million shares of our Class A Common Stock were outstanding and exercisable. The exercise price of these warrants are $11.50 per share in the case of the public warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering and $0.01 per share in the case of the Magna Warrants. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to holders of our Class A Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. However, there is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nOn March 19, 2021, we issued a press release announcing the redemption of all of our outstanding warrants (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d) to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock that were issued under the Warrant Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2018, by and between the Company (f/k/a Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp., Inc.) and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent (the \u201cWarrant Agreement\u201d), as part of the units sold in our initial public offering. In accordance with Section 3.3.1(b) of the Warrant Agreement, our board of directors has elected to require that, following delivery of this notice of redemption, all Public Warrants be exercised only on a cashless basis. Warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock that were issued under the Warrant Agreement in a private placement simultaneously with our initial public offering and are still held by the initial holders thereof or their permitted transferees are not subject to the notice of redemption.", "PERMNO": 18184, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SPAQ"}
