{"cik": "1171825", "company": "CIT GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe operation of our business, and the economic and regulatory climate in the U.S. and other regions of the world involve various elements of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making a decision whether to invest in the Company. This is a discussion of the risks that we believe are material to our business and does not include all risks, material or immaterial, that may possibly affect our business. Any of the following risks, and additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nIf the assumptions and analyses underlying our strategy and business plan, including with respect to market conditions, capital and liquidity, business strategy, and operations are incorrect, we may be unsuccessful in executing our strategy and business plan.\nA number of strategic issues affect our business, including how we allocate our capital and liquidity, our business strategy, our funding models, and the quality and efficiency of operations. We developed our strategy and business plan based upon certain assumptions, analyses, and financial forecasts, including with respect to our capital levels, funding model, credit ratings, revenue growth, earnings, interest margins, expense levels, cash flow, credit losses, liquidity and financing sources, lines of business and geographic scope, acquisitions and divestitures, equipment residual values, capital expenditures, retention of key employees, and the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions. Financial forecasts are inherently subject to many uncertainties and are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. Accordingly, our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from what we have forecast. If we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives effectively, we may need to refine, supplement, or modify our business plan and strategy in significant ways. If we are unable to fully implement our business plan and strategy, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from acquiring a business or assets or from disposing of a business or assets, which may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nAs part of our strategy and business plan, we may consider engaging in business or asset acquisitions or sales to manage our business, the products and services we offer, and our asset levels, credit exposures, or liquidity position. There are a number of risks inherent in acquisition and sale transactions, including the risk that we fail to identify or acquire key businesses or assets, that we fail to complete a pending transaction, that we fail to sell a business or assets that are considered non-strategic or high risk, that we overpay for an acquisition or receive inadequate consideration for a disposition, or that we fail to properly integrate an acquired company or to realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction. We acquired IMB HoldCo LLC and its subsidiary, OneWest Bank, N.A., in 2015 and two businesses, Nacco and Direct Capital, in 2014. We sold our equipment financing portfolio in the U.K. in January 2016; equipment financing portfolios in Mexico and Brazil in 2015; and our student lending portfolio, small business lending portfolio, and various financing portfolios in Europe, Asia, and Latin America in 2014. We are currently looking at strategic alternatives for our Commercial Aerospace business, which may be structured as a spin-off or sale, and we have transferred our financings in Canada and China into assets held for sale.\nIn engaging in business acquisitions, CIT may decide to pay a premium over book and market values to complete the transaction, which may result in some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share. If CIT uses substantial cash or other liquid assets or incurs substantial debt to acquire a business or assets, we could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures. CIT used a combination of cash ($1.9 billion) and common stock (30.9 million shares valued at $1.5 billion) to complete the OneWest Transaction. Integrating the operations of an acquired entity can be difficult. Prior to completing the OneWest Transaction, CIT and OneWest Bank had different policies, procedures, and processes, including accounting, credit and other risk and reporting policies, and utilized different systems, which are requiring significant time, cost, and effort to integrate. As a result, CIT may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. CIT may also be exposed to other risks inherent in an acquisition, including the risk of unknown or contingent liabilities, changes in our credit, liquidity, interest rate or other risk profiles, potential asset quality issues, potential disruption of our existing business and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, possible loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business, and the risk that certain items were not accounted for properly by the seller in accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards. If we fail to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product scope, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition, or if we are unable to adequately integrate the acquired business, or experience unexpected costs, changes in our risk profile, or disruption to our business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCIT must generally receive regulatory approval before it can acquire a bank or BHC or for any acquisition in which the assets acquired exceeds $10 billion. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approval may be granted. We may be required to sell assets or business units as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. If CIT fails to close a pending transaction for any reason, including failure to obtain either regulatory approvals or shareholder approval, CIT may be exposed to potential disruption of our business, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, risk from a failure to diversify our business and products, and increased expenses without a commensurate increase in revenues.\nAs a result of economic cycles and other factors, the value of certain asset classes may fluctuate and decline below their historic\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 23\ncost. If CIT is holding such businesses or asset classes, we may not recover our carrying value if we sell such businesses or assets or we may end up with a higher risk exposure to specific customers, industries, asset classes, or geographic regions than we have targeted. In addition, potential purchasers may be unwilling to pay an amount equal to the face value of a loan or lease if the purchaser is concerned about the quality of our credit underwriting. Potential purchasers may also be unwilling to pay adequate consideration for a business or assets depending on the nature of any financial, legal, or tax structures of the business, the regulatory or geographic exposure of the business, the projected growth rate of the business, or the size or nature of its outstanding commitments. These transactions, if completed, may reduce the size of our business and we may not be able to replace the lending and leasing activity associated with these businesses. As a result, future disposition of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur losses on loans, securities and other acquired assets of OneWest Bank that are materially greater than reflected in our fair value adjustments.\nWe accounted for the OneWest Transaction under the purchase method of accounting, recording the acquired assets and liabilities of OneWest Bank at fair value. All PCI loans acquired in the OneWest Transaction were recorded at fair value based on the present value of their expected cash flows. We estimated cash flows using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models using assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We may not realize the estimated cash flows or fair value of these loans. In addition, although the difference between the pre-acquisition carrying value of the credit-impaired loans and their expected cash flows - the \u201cnon-accretable difference\u201d - is available to absorb future charge-offs, we may be required to increase our allowance for credit losses and related provision expense because of subsequent additional deterioration in these loans.\nCompetition from both traditional competitors and new market entrants may adversely affect our market share, profitability, and returns.\nOur markets are highly competitive and are characterized by competitive factors that vary based upon product and geographic region. We have a wide variety of competitors that include captive and independent finance companies, commercial banks and thrift institutions, industrial banks, community banks, leasing companies, hedge funds, insurance companies, mortgage companies, manufacturers and vendors.\nWe compete on the basis of pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits and the pricing for equipment leases), product terms and structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology in the delivery of products and services to our customers is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction.\nIf we are unable to address the competitive pressures that we face, we could lose market share. On the other hand, if we meet those competitive pressures, it is possible that we could incur significant additional expense, experience lower returns due to compressed net finance revenue, and/or incur increased losses due to less rigorous risk standards.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nIf we fail to maintain sufficient capital or adequate liquidity to meet regulatory capital guidelines, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNew and evolving capital and liquidity standards will have a significant effect on banks and BHCs. The Basel III Final Rule issued by the federal banking agencies requires BHCs and insured depository institutions to maintain more and higher quality capital than in the past. In addition, the federal banking agencies created a standardized minimum liquidity requirement for large and internationally active banking organizations, referred to as the \u201cliquidity coverage ratio\u201d, or \u201cLCR\u201d. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies are also expected to issue a rule implementing the net stable funding ratio, or \u201cNSFR\u201d, called for by the Basel III Final Framework. If we incur future losses that reduce our capital levels or affect our liquidity, we may fail to maintain our regulatory capital or our liquidity above regulatory minimums and at economically satisfactory levels. The new capital standards could require CIT to maintain more and higher quality capital than previously expected and could limit our business activities (including lending) and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions, to diversify our capital structure, or to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. The new liquidity standards could also require CIT to hold higher levels of short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets. If we fail to maintain the appropriate capital levels or adequate liquidity, we could become subject to a variety of formal or informal enforcement actions, which may include restrictions on our business activities, including limiting lending and leasing activities, limiting the expansion of our business, either organically or through acquisitions, requiring the raising of additional capital, which may be dilutive to shareholders, or requiring prior regulatory approval before taking certain actions, such as payment of dividends or otherwise returning capital to shareholders. If we are unable to meet any of these capital or liquidity standards, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate liquidity or to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our obligations as they come due, whether due to a downgrade in our credit ratings or for any other reasons, it could materially adversely affect our future business operations.\nCIT\u2019s liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. Our liquidity, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets or fund our activities through bank deposits, could be affected by a number of factors, including market conditions, our capital structure and capital levels, our credit ratings, and the performance of our business. An adverse change in any of those factors, and particularly a downgrade in our credit ratings, could negatively affect CIT\u2019s liquidity and competitive position, increase our funding costs, or limit our access to the capital markets or deposit markets. Further, an adverse change in the performance of our business could have a negative impact on our operating cash flow. CIT\u2019s credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n24 CIT ANNUAL REPORT\nrating agencies, which consider a number of factors, including CIT\u2019s own financial strength, performance, prospects, and operations, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase our current ratings, which currently are not investment grade at the holding company level. If we experience a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity, or fail to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our obligations, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully expand our sources of deposits at CIT Bank.\nCIT Bank currently has a branch network with 70 branches, which offer a variety of deposit products. However, CIT also must rely on its online bank, brokered deposits, and certain deposit sweep accounts to raise additional deposits. Our ability to raise deposits and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is dependent on CIT Bank\u2019s capital levels. Federal banking law generally prohibits a bank from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits, unless the bank is well-capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the FDIC. There are also restrictions on interest rates that may be paid by banks that are less than well capitalized, under which such a bank generally may not pay an interest rate on any deposit of more than 75 basis points over the national rate published by the FDIC, unless the FDIC determines that the bank is operating in a high-rate area. Continued expansion of CIT Bank\u2019s retail online banking platform to diversify the types of deposits that it accepts may require significant time, effort, and expense to implement. We are likely to face significant competition for deposits from larger BHCs who are similarly seeking larger and more stable pools of funding. If CIT Bank fails to expand and diversify its deposit-taking capability, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be restricted from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.\nCIT is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, including CIT Bank, and relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for a significant portion of its cash flow. Federal banking laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that CIT Bank can pay. BHCs with assets in excess of $50 billion must develop and submit to the FRB for review an annual capital plan detailing their plans for the payment of dividends on their common or preferred stock or the repurchase of common stock. If our capital plan were not approved or if we do not satisfy applicable capital requirements, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted. We cannot determine whether the FRBNY will object to future capital returns.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe could be adversely affected by the additional enhanced prudential supervision requirements applicable to large banking organizations due to the acquisition of IMB Holdco LLC and OneWest Bank.\nWhen we acquired IMB Holdco LLC and its subsidiary, OneWest Bank we exceeded the $50 billion threshold and became subject to the FRB\u2019s enhanced prudential standards applicable to BHC\u2019s with an average of $50 billion or more of assets for the prior four quarters. There are a number of regulations that are now applicable to us that are not applicable to smaller banking organizations, including but not limited to enhanced rules on capital plans and stress testing, enhanced governance standards, liquidity stress testing and enhanced reporting requirements, and a requirement to develop a resolution plan. Each of these rules will require CIT to dedicate significant time, effort, and expense to comply with the enhanced standards and requirements. If we fail to develop at a reasonable cost the systems and processes necessary to comply with the enhanced standards and requirements imposed by these rules, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to significant government regulation and supervision and we could be adversely affected by banking or other regulations, including new regulations or changes in existing regulations or the application thereof.\nThe financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. We are subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision of the FRB, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements. In addition, CIT Bank is subject to supervision by the OCC, including risk-based capital requirements and information reporting requirements. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and is not intended to protect debt and equity security holders. If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements applicable to bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to undertake certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain activities or acquisitions. In addition, our banking regulators have significant discretion in the examination and enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations, and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions, or may require us to maintain more capital.\nProposals for legislation to further regulate, restrict, and tax certain financial services activities are continually being introduced in the United States Congress and in state legislatures. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was adopted in 2010, constitutes the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial services regulation in decades, including provisions affecting, among other things, (i) corporate governance and executive compensation of companies whose securities are registered with the SEC, (ii) FDIC insurance assessments based on asset levels rather than deposits, (iii) minimum capital levels for BHCs, (iv) derivatives activities, proprietary trading, and private investment funds offered by financial institutions, and (v) the regulation of large financial institutions. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established additional regulatory bodies, including the FSOC, which is charged with identifying systemic risks, promoting stronger financial regulation, and identifying those non-bank companies that are \u201csystemically important\u201d, and the CFPB, which has broad authority to establish a federal regulatory framework for consumer financial protection. The agencies regulating the financial services industry periodically adopt changes to their regulations and are still finalizing regulations to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. In recent\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 25\nyears, regulators have increased significantly the level and scope of their supervision and regulation of the financial services industry. We are unable to predict the form or nature of any future changes to statutes or regulation, including the interpretation or implementation thereof. Such increased supervision and regulation could significantly affect our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner, restrict the type of activities in which we are permitted to engage, or subject us to stricter and more conservative capital, leverage, liquidity, and risk management standards. Any such action could have a substantial impact on us, significantly increase our costs, limit our growth opportunities, affect our strategies and business operations and increase our capital requirements, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Aerospace, Rail, Maritime, and other equipment financing operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In the U.S., our equipment leasing operations, including for aircraft, railcars, ships, and other equipment, are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards promulgated by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Association of American Railroads, the Maritime Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2015, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d) and Transport Canada (\u201cTC\u201d) each released final rules establishing enhanced design and performance criteria for tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid and requiring retrofitting of existing tank cars to meet the enhanced standards within a specified time frame. In addition, the U.S. Congress enacted the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (\u201cFAST Act\u201d), which, among other things, expanded the scope of tank cars classified as carrying flammable liquids, added additional design and performance criteria for tank cars in flammable service, and required additional studies of certain criteria established by PHMSA and TC. In addition, state agencies regulate some aspects of rail and maritime operations with respect to health and safety matters not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business operations and our equipment leasing portfolios may be adversely impacted by rules and regulations promulgated by governmental and industry agencies, which could require substantial modification, maintenance, or refurbishment of our aircraft, railcars, ships, or other equipment, or potentially make such equipment inoperable or obsolete. Violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.\nWe are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, and may from time to time be involved in government investigations and inquiries, related to the conduct of our business, the results of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nWe are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, and may from time to time be involved in government investigations and inquiries, relating to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of our business (collectively, \u201cLitigation\u201d). We are also at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to Litigation they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. It is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of Litigation matters, particularly when such matters are in their early stages or where the claimants seek indeterminate damages. We cannot state with certainty what the eventual outcome of the pending Litigation will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines, or penalties related to each pending matter will be, if any. The actual results of resolving Litigation matters may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved, or judgments may be rendered, or fines or penalties assessed in matters for which we have no reserves. Adverse judgments, fines or penalties in one or more Litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretations of such laws and regulations\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have business operations. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. Changes to the tax laws, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our net income.\nIt is difficult to predict whether changes to the U.S. tax laws and regulations will occur within the next few years. Governments\u2019 need for additional revenue makes it likely that there will be continued proposals to change tax rules in ways that could increase our effective tax rate. In addition, such changes could include a widening of the corporate tax base by including earnings from international operations. Such changes to the tax laws could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.\nConversely, should the tax laws be amended to reduce our effective tax rate, the value of our remaining deferred tax asset would decline resulting in a charge to our net income during the period in which the amendment is enacted. In addition, the value assigned to our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income. If we are not able to do so at the rates currently projected, we may need to increase our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge recorded to net income.\nThese changes could affect our regulatory capital ratios as calculated in accordance with the Basel III Final Rule. The exact impact is dependent upon the effects an amendment has on our net deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards, versus our net deferred tax assets related to temporary timing differences, as the former is a deduction from capital (the numerator to the ratios), while the latter is included in risk-weighted assets (the denominator). See \u201cRegulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements\u201d section of Item 1. Business Overview for further discussion regarding the impact of deferred tax assets on regulatory capital.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n26 CIT ANNUAL REPORT\nOur investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe invest in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy resources. Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. We are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside of our control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed. If we are unable to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe previously originated and securitized and currently service reverse mortgages, which subjects us to additional risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe previously originated and securitized and currently service reverse mortgages. The reverse mortgage business is subject to substantial risks, including market, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational and legal risks. A reverse mortgage is a loan available to seniors aged 62 or older that allows homeowners to borrow money against the value of their home. We depend on our ability to securitize reverse mortgages, subsequent draws, mortgage insurance premiums and servicing fees, and would be adversely affected if our ability to access the securitization market were to be limited. Defaults on reverse mortgages leading to foreclosures may occur if borrowers fail to meet maintenance obligations, such as payment of taxes or home insurance premiums, or fail to meet requirements to occupy the premises. An increase in foreclosure rates may increase our cost of servicing. We may become subject to negative publicity if defaults on reverse mortgages lead to foreclosures or evictions of senior homeowners.\nAs a reverse mortgage servicer, we are responsible for funding any payments due to borrowers in a timely manner, remitting to credit owners interest accrued, paying for interest shortfalls, and funding advances such as taxes and home insurance premiums. During any period in which a borrower is not making required real estate tax and property insurance premium payments, we may be required under servicing agreements to advance our own funds to pay property taxes, insurance premiums, legal expenses and other protective advances. We also may be required to advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties. In certain situations, our contractual obligations may require us to make certain advances for which we may not be reimbursed. In addition, if a mortgage loan serviced by us defaults or becomes delinquent, the repayment to us of the advance may be delayed until the mortgage loan is repaid or refinanced or liquidation occurs. A delay in collecting advances may adversely affect our liquidity, and a failure to be reimbursed for advances could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Advances are typically recovered upon weekly or monthly reimbursement or from securitization in the market. We could receive requests for advances in excess of amounts we are able to fund, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity. All of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to reverse mortgage programs operated by the FHA, HUD or the government-sponsored enterprises, or a loss of our approved status under such programs, could adversely affect our reverse mortgage division.\nThe mortgage industry, including both forward mortgages and reverse mortgages, is largely dependent upon the FHA, HUD and government-sponsored enterprises, like the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d). There can be no guarantee that any or all of these entities will continue to participate in the mortgage industry, including forward mortgages and reverse mortgages, or that they will not make material changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to the mortgage industry. For example, the FHA has issued regulations since January 1, 2013 governing its reverse mortgage program that impact initial mortgage insurance premiums and principal limit factors, impose restrictions on the amount of funds that senior borrowers may draw down at closing and during the first 12 months after closing, and will require a financial assessment for all borrowers to ensure that they have the capacity and willingness to meet their financial obligations and the terms of the reverse mortgage. In addition, the changes require borrowers to set aside a portion of the loan proceeds they receive at closing (or withhold a portion of monthly loan disbursements) for the payment of property taxes and homeowners insurance based on the results of the financial assessment. Similarly, the CFPB has issued new rules for mortgage origination and mortgage servicing. Both the origination and servicing rules create new private rights of action for consumers against lenders and servicers in the event of certain violations.\nAdditionally, two GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) are currently in conservatorship, with their primary regulator acting as a conservator. We cannot predict when or if the conservatorships will end or whether, as a result of legislative or regulatory action, there will be any associated changes to the structure of these GSEs or the housing finance industry more generally, including, but not limited to, changes to the structure of these GSEs or the housing finance industry more generally, including, but not limited to, changes to the relationship among these GSEs, the government and the private markets. The effects of any such reform on our business and financial results are uncertain.\nAny material changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to our residential mortgage business could have a material adverse effect on our overall business and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 27\nIf we are determined to be liable with respect to interest curtailment obligations or \u201ccompensatory fees\u201d on both forward mortgages and reverse mortgages arising out of servicing errors, and we are required to record incremental charges for such amounts, there may be an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have originated and securitized, as well as acquired through multiple portfolio purchases, both forward mortgages and reverse mortgages for which we have retained the servicing rights. Certain of these mortgage loans are insured and guaranteed by the FHA, which is administered by HUD. FHA regulations provide that servicers must meet a series of event-specific timeframes during the default, foreclosure, conveyance, and mortgage insurance claim cycles. Failure to timely meet any processing deadline may stop the accrual of debenture interest otherwise payable in satisfaction of a claim under the FHA mortgage insurance contract and the servicer may be responsible to HUD for debenture interest that is not self-curtailed or for making the credit owner whole for any interest curtailed by HUD due to not meeting the required event-specific timeframes. The penalty HUD applies for failure to meet the foreclosure timeline is curtailment of interest from the date of failure (e.g. the date to take the first legal action in the foreclosure process is missed) to the claims settlement date, which might be months or years after the missed deadline.\nAs a servicer of forward residential mortgage loans and reverse mortgage loans owned by the GSEs, the servicing guides provide that servicers may become liable for so-called \u201ccompensatory fees\u201d for certain delays in completing the foreclosure process with respect to defaulted loans. The compensatory fee formula represents the pass-through interest rate multiplied by the unpaid principal balance multiplied by the number of days of purported servicer delay (i.e. beyond the allowable time frame established by the GSEs) which might be months or years depending on the state and jurisdiction. If we are required to record incremental charges for interest curtailment obligations or for compensatory fees, there may be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCredit and Market Risks\nWe could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.\nCIT\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. CIT has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, private equity funds, and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could affect market liquidity and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose CIT to credit risk in the event of default by its counterparty or client. In addition, CIT\u2019s credit risk may be impacted if the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to CIT. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect, possibly materially, CIT.\nOur Commercial Aerospace business is concentrated by industry and our retail banking business is concentrated geographically, and any downturn in the aerospace industry or in the geographic area of our retail banking business may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our business is diversified by customer, industry, and geography. However, although our Commercial Aerospace business is diversified by customer and geography, it is concentrated in one industry and represents over 20% of our financing and leasing assets. If there is a significant downturn in commercial air travel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur retail banking business is primarily concentrated within our retail branch network, which is located in Southern California. Although our other businesses are national in scope, these other businesses also have a presence within the Southern California geographic market. Adverse conditions in the Southern California geographic market, such as inflation, unemployment, recession, natural disasters, or other factors beyond our control, could impact the ability of borrowers in Southern California to repay their loans, decrease the value of the collateral securing loans in Southern California, or affect the ability of our customers in Southern California to continue conducting business with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate.\nThe quality of our financing and leasing assets depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. We maintain a consolidated allowance for loan losses on our financing and leasing assets to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. The amount of our allowance reflects management\u2019s judgment of losses inherent in the portfolio. However, the economic environment is dynamic, and our portfolio credit quality could decline in the future.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not keep pace with changes in the credit-worthiness of our customers or in collateral values. If the credit quality of our customer base declines, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes significantly, if we are unable to collect the full amount on accounts receivable taken as collateral, or if the value of equipment, real estate, or other collateral deteriorates significantly, our allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition to customer credit risk associated with loans and leases, we are exposed to other forms of credit risk, including counterparties to our derivative transactions, loan sales, syndications and equipment purchases. These counterparties include other financial institutions, manufacturers, and our customers. If our credit underwriting processes or credit risk judgments fail to adequately identify or assess such risks, or if the credit quality of our derivative counterparties, customers, manufacturers, or other parties with which we conduct business materially deteriorates, we may be exposed to credit risk related losses that may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n28 CIT ANNUAL REPORT\nWe may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment we lease to our customers.\nOur financing and leasing assets include a significant portion of leased equipment, including but not limited to aircraft, railcars and locomotives, technology and office equipment, and medical equipment. The realization of equipment values (residual values) during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element in the profitability of our leasing business. At the inception of each lease, we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the end of the lease term or end of the equipment\u2019s estimated useful life.\nIf the market value of leased equipment decreases at a rate greater than we projected, whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence, unusual wear and tear on the equipment, excessive use of the equipment, recession or other adverse economic conditions, including a significant decrease in the shipment of oil, coal, or other commodities or goods due to changing market conditions, or other factors, it could adversely affect the current values or the residual values of such equipment.\nFurther, certain equipment residual values, including commercial aerospace residuals, are dependent on the manufacturers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 warranties, reputation, and other factors, including market liquidity. Residual values for certain equipment, including aerospace, rail, and medical equipment, may also be affected by changes in laws or regulations that mandate design changes or additional safety features. For example, new regulations issued by the PHMSA in the U.S. and TC in Canada in 2015, and supplemented by the FAST Act in the U.S., will require us to retrofit a significant portion of our tank cars over the next several years in order to continue leasing those tank cars for the transport of crude oil. In addition, we may not realize the full market value of equipment if we are required to sell it to meet liquidity needs or for other reasons outside of the ordinary course of business. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will realize our estimated residual values for equipment.\nThe degree of residual realization risk varies by transaction type. Capital leases bear the least risk because contractual payments usually cover approximately 90% of the equipment\u2019s cost at the inception of the lease. Operating leases have a higher degree of risk because a smaller percentage of the equipment\u2019s value is covered by contractual cash flows over the term of the lease. A significant portion of our leasing portfolios are comprised of operating leases, which increase our residual realization risk.\nInvestment in and revenues from our foreign operations are subject to various risks and requirements associated with transacting business in foreign countries.\nAn economic recession or downturn, increased competition, or business disruption associated with the political or regulatory environments in the international markets in which we operate could adversely affect us.\nIn addition, our foreign operations generally conduct business in foreign currencies, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These exposures, if not effectively hedged could have a material adverse effect on our investment in international operations and the level of international revenues that we generate from international financing and leasing transactions. Reported results from our operations in foreign countries may fluctuate from period to period due to exchange rate movements in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly exchange rate movements in the Canadian dollar, which is our largest non-U.S. exposure.\nForeign countries have various compliance requirements for financial statement audits and tax filings, which are required in order to obtain and maintain licenses to transact business and may be different in some respects from GAAP in the U.S. or the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. If we are unable to properly complete and file our statutory audit reports or tax filings, regulators or tax authorities in the applicable jurisdiction may restrict our ability to do business.\nFurthermore, our international operations could expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trade sanction laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other federal statutes. Under trade sanction laws, the government may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities with sanctioned parties or in sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. If any of the risks described above materialize, it could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nThese laws also prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with government entities and have contracts in countries known to experience corruption. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or associates that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. Our employees, consultants, sales agents, or associates may engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by significant changes in interest rates.\nWe rely on borrowed money from deposits, secured debt, and unsecured debt to fund our business. We derive the bulk of our income from net finance revenue, which is the difference between interest and rental income on our financing and leasing assets and interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, depreciation on our operating lease equipment and maintenance and other operating lease expenses. Prevailing economic conditions, the trade, fiscal, and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affects our net finance revenue. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 29\nsecurities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions.\nAlthough interest rates are currently lower than usual, any significant decrease in market interest rates may result in a change in net interest margin and net finance revenue. A substantial portion of our loans and other financing products, as well as our deposits and other borrowings, bear interest at floating interest rates. If interest rates increase, monthly interest obligations owed by our customers to us will also increase, as will our own interest expense. Demand for our loans or other financing products may decrease as interest rates rise or if interest rates are expected to rise in the future. In addition, if prevailing interest rates increase, some of our customers may not be able to make the increased interest payments or refinance their balloon and bullet payment transactions, resulting in payment defaults and loan impairments. Conversely, if interest rates remain low, our interest expense may decrease, but our customers may refinance the loans they have with us at lower interest rates, or with others, leading to lower revenues. As interest rates rise and fall over time, any significant change in market rates may result in a decrease in net finance revenue, particularly if the interest rates we pay on our deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates we charge our customers do not change in unison, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates can reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale, and can make our mortgage banking revenue volatile from quarter to quarter, which can reduce our earnings.\nWe have a portfolio of mortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), which is the right to service a mortgage loan - collect principal, interest and escrow amounts - for a fee, which we retained after selling or securitizing mortgage loans that we originated or purchased. We initially carry our MSRs at fair value, measured by the present value of the estimated future net servicing income, which includes assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Changes in interest rates can affect the prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. As interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgages by refinancing at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of MSRs can decrease. Each quarter we evaluate the fair value of our MSRs, and decreases in fair value below amortized cost will reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. Even if interest rates fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or increase only modestly due to economic conditions or a weak or deteriorating housing market, which may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs\u2019 value caused by lower rates.\nWe may be adversely affected by deterioration in economic conditions that is general in scope or affects specific industries, products or geographic areas.\nGiven the high percentage of our financing and leasing assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and leases, and the importance of lending and leasing to our overall business, weak economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Prolonged economic weakness or other adverse economic or financial developments in the U.S. or global economies in general, or affecting specific industries, geographic locations and/or products, would likely adversely impact credit quality as borrowers may fail to meet their debt payment obligations, particularly customers with highly leveraged loans. Adverse economic conditions have in the past and could in the future result in declines in collateral values, which also decreases our ability to fund against collateral. This would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The value to us of other assets such as investment securities, most of which are debt securities or other financial instruments supported by loans, similarly would be negatively impacted by widespread decreases in credit quality resulting from a weakening of the economy. Accordingly, higher credit and collateral related losses and decreases in the value of financial instruments could impact our financial position or operating results.\nAside from a general economic downturn, a downturn in certain industries may result in reduced demand for products that we finance in that industry or negatively impact collection and asset recovery efforts. Decreased demand for the products of various manufacturing customers due to recession may adversely affect their ability to repay their loans and leases with us. Similarly, a decrease in the level of airline passenger traffic or a decline in railroad shipping volumes may adversely affect our aerospace and rail businesses, the value of our aircraft and rail assets, and the ability of our lessees to make lease payments. Further, a decrease in prices or reduced demand for certain raw materials or bulk products, such as oil, coal, or steel, may result in a significant decrease in gross revenues and profits of our borrowers and lessees or a decrease in demand for certain types of equipment for the production, processing and transport of such raw materials or bulk products, including certain specialized railcars, which may adversely affect the ability of our customers to make payments on their loans and leases and the value of our rail assets and other leased equipment.\nWe are also affected by the economic and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in reaction to economic conditions. Changes in monetary policies of the FRB and non-U.S. central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds for lending, capital raising, and investment activities, and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, such changes may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict.\nOperational Risks\nRevenue growth from new business initiatives and expense reductions from efficiency improvements may not be achieved.\nAs part of its ongoing business, CIT from time to time enters into new business initiatives. In addition, CIT from time to time has targeted certain expense reductions in its business. The new business initiatives may not be successful in increasing revenue, whether due to significant levels of competition, lack of demand for services, lack of name recognition or a record of prior performance, or otherwise, or may require higher expenditures than anticipated to generate new business volume. The expense initiatives may not reduce expenses as much as anticipated, whether\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n30 CIT ANNUAL REPORT\ndue to delays in implementation, higher than expected or unanticipated costs of implementation, increased costs for new regulatory obligations, or for other reasons. If CIT is unable to achieve the anticipated revenue growth from its new business initiatives or the projected expense reductions from efficiency improvements, its results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, it could result in a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements.\nManagement of CIT is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. If we identify material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal controls, or if material weaknesses or other deficiencies exist that we fail to identify, our risk will be increased that a material misstatement to our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any such potential material misstatement, if not prevented or detected, could require us to restate previously released financial statements and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards or interpretations could materially impact our reported earnings and financial condition.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory agencies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of CIT\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, potentially resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings.\nIf the models that we use in our business are poorly designed, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely if their perception is that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nIt could adversely affect our business if we fail to retain and/or attract skilled employees.\nOur business and results of operations will depend in part upon our ability to retain and attract highly skilled and qualified executive officers and management, financial, compliance, technical, marketing, sales, and support employees. Competition for qualified executive officers and employees can be challenging, and CIT cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining such individuals. This competition can lead to increased expenses in many areas. If we fail to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees, it could materially adversely affect our ability to compete and it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully operate our business or to meet our operations, risk management, compliance, regulatory, funding and financial reporting requirements.\nWe and our subsidiaries are party to various financing arrangements, commercial contracts and other arrangements that under certain circumstances give, or in some cases may give, the counterparty the ability to exercise rights and remedies under such arrangements which, if exercised, may have material adverse consequences.\nWe and our subsidiaries are party to various financing arrangements, commercial contracts and other arrangements, such as securitization transactions, derivatives transactions, funding facilities, and agreements to purchase or sell loans, leases or other assets, that give, or in some cases may give, the counterparty the ability to exercise rights and remedies upon the occurrence of certain events. Such events may include a material adverse effect or material adverse change (or similar event), a breach of representations or warranties, a failure to disclose material information, a breach of covenants, certain insolvency events, a default under certain specified other obligations, or a failure to comply with certain financial covenants. The counterparty could have the ability, depending on the arrangement, to, among other things, require early repayment of amounts owed by us or our subsidiaries and in some cases payment of penalty amounts, or require the repurchase of assets previously sold to the counterparty. Additionally, a default under financing arrangements or derivatives transactions that exceed a certain size threshold in the aggregate may also cause a cross-default under instruments governing our other financing arrangements or derivatives transactions. If the ability of any counterparty to exercise such rights and remedies is triggered and we are unsuccessful in avoiding or minimizing the adverse consequences discussed above, such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liability or claims for negligence, property damage, or personal injury when we take title to properties or lease certain equipment.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate that contains or was used in the manufacture or processing of hazardous materials, or that is subject to other hazardous risks. In addition, we may lease equipment to our customers that is used to mine, develop, process, or transport hazardous materials. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities or claims for negligence, property damage, or personal injury with respect to these properties or equipment. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 31\nfor property damage, personal injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, accidents or other hazardous risks, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site or equipment involved in a hazardous incident, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination, property damage, personal injury or other hazardous risks emanating from the property or related to the equipment. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities or claims for negligence, property damage, or personal injury, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our systems, employees, and certain third party vendors and service providers in conducting our operations, and certain failures, including internal or external fraud, operational errors, systems malfunctions, disasters, or terrorist activities, could materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical and recordkeeping errors, and computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Our businesses depend on our ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. If any of our operational, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. We are similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or intentional sabotage or fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. Third parties with which we do business, including vendors that provide internet access, portfolio servicing, deposit products, or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns, failures, or capacity constraints of their own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or cause financial loss, potential liability to clients, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage, or regulatory intervention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural or man-made disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or tornados, disease pandemics, or events arising from local or regional politics, including terrorist acts or international hostilities. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to clients and loss or liability to us. In addition, there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The computer systems and network systems we and others use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may arise in both our internally developed systems and the systems of third-party hardware, software, and service providers. In addition, our computer systems and network infrastructure present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking, computer viruses, or identity theft. Any such failure could affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance. The adverse impact of disasters, terrorist activities, or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and if we are unable to implement new or upgraded technology when required, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introduction of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. If we are unable to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow us to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by information security breaches or cyber security attacks.\nInformation security risks for large financial institutions such as CIT have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. Our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of CIT\u2019s or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, or otherwise disrupt CIT\u2019s or its customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nIn recent years, there have been several well-publicized attacks on retailers and financial services companies in which the perpetrators gained unauthorized access to confidential information and customer data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks, phishing, or other means. There have also been a series of apparently related denial of service attacks on large financial services companies. In a denial of service attack, hackers flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n32 CIT ANNUAL REPORT\nextended periods of time. We recently experienced denial of service attacks that targeted a third party service provider that provides software and customer services with respect to our online deposit taking activities, which resulted in temporary disruptions in customers\u2019 ability to perform online banking transactions, although no customer data was lost or compromised. Even if not directed at CIT specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.\nSince January 1, 2013, we have not experienced any material information security breaches involving either proprietary or customer information. However, if we experience cyber attacks or other information security breaches in the future, either the Company or its customers may suffer material losses. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of CIT and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our online banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 93150, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CIT"}
