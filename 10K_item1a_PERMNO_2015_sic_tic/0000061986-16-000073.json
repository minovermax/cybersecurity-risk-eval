RISK FACTORS\nThe following are risk factors identified by management that if any events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR PROPOSED SEPARATION OF OUR CRANES AND FOODSERVICE BUSINESSES BY SPIN-OFF\nThe proposed separation of our cranes business and foodservice business is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, has required and may continue to require significant time and attention of our management, and may have a material adverse effect on us whether or not it is completed.\nOn January 29, 2015, we disclosed that our board of directors approved a plan to pursue a separation of our cranes business and foodservice business into two independent, publicly-traded companies through a Spin-Off. The proposed separation is subject to customary conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of legal opinions concerning the tax-free nature of the transaction and final approval by our board of directors. In addition, unanticipated developments or changes in the macroeconomic environment, credit markets and equity markets, as well as other market conditions, may impact the plan to effect the proposed Spin-Off. For these and other reasons, we may not complete the Spin-Off as expected during the first quarter of 2016, or at all.\nWhether or not we complete the Spin-Off, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences as a result of pursuing the Spin-Off, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nexecution of the proposed Spin-Off will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract management from the operation of our businesses and the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nour employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the Spin-Off;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay significant costs and expenses relating to the Spin-Off, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, whether or not it is completed; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the Spin-Off or fail to complete it on a timely basis.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nAlthough we believe that separating our Foodservice business from our Crane business by means of the Spin-Off will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to us and our shareholders, the Spin-Off may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate, and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits. In addition, we will incur one-time costs and ongoing costs in connection with, or as a result of, the Spin-Off, including costs of operating as independent, publicly-traded companies that the two businesses will no longer be able to share. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize. If we do not realize the intended benefits of the Spin-Off or if our costs exceed our estimates, the company could suffer a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Spin-Off of is completed, the trading price of our common stock will decline.\nWe expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the Spin-Off, which will only represent the value of our cranes business, to be significantly lower than immediately prior to the Spin-Off because the trading price for our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our foodservice business.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, the aggregate value of your common stock of (a) the company and (b) MFS may be less than the aggregate value at which the company's common stock might have traded had the Spin-Off not occurred.\nThe common stock of (a) the company and (b) the MFS that you may hold following the Spin-Off may collectively trade at an aggregate value less than the value at which the company's common stock might have traded had the Spin-Off not occurred due to, among other factors, the expected or actual future performance of either the company or MFS as a separate, independent company and the future shareholder base and market for the company's common stock and the shares of MFS.\nThere could be significant liability if the Spin-Off is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nA condition to the Spin-Off is our receipt of an opinion from our legal counsel substantially to the effect that the Spin-Off and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to us and our shareholders under Section 355, 368 and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cTax Code\u201d), except to the extent of any cash our shareholders receive in lieu of fractional shares of the common stock of MFS. Any such opinion is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the Spin-Off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings made by us regarding the past and future conduct of the cranes and foodservice businesses and other matters, which, if incomplete, incorrect or not satisfied, could alter the conclusions of the party giving such opinion.\nIf the Spin-Off and certain related transactions are ultimately determined to be taxable, the Spin-Off could be treated as a taxable dividend to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and our shareholders could incur significant federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of our common stock exceeds our tax basis in such stock on the date of the Spin-Off. Moreover, while in some instances, based upon agreements we expect to enter into governing the Spin-Off, MFS will be required to indemnify us for certain taxes related to the Spin-Off, such agreements are not binding on the IRS and, as a legal matter, we are jointly and severally liable for any U.S. federal consolidated income taxes (and certain state and local income taxes) imposed on us or MFS for the taxable year of the Spin-Off and for prior taxable years.\nAfter the Spin-Off, certain of our directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership of MFS and relationships with the directors and officers of MFS.\nCertain of the persons we expect to be our executive officers and directors following the Spin-Off will have professional relationships with persons will be the executive officers, directors or employees of MFS following the Spin-Off. In addition, because of their ownership of our common stock, following the Spin-Off, certain of our directors and executive officers will own common stock in the foodservice, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. These relationships and financial interests may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and MFS. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between MFS and the company regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Spin-Off and the relationship thereafter between the companies.\nPotential liabilities may arise under fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws and legal capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn the event that, following the Spin-Off, any entity involved in the Spin-Off fails to pay its creditors or enters insolvency proceedings, the transactions related to the Spin-Off may be challenged under U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws, as well as legal capital requirements governing distributions and similar transactions. If a court were to determine under these laws that, (a) at the time of the Spin-Off, the entity in question (1) was insolvent; (2) was rendered insolvent by reason of the Spin-Off; (3) had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital; (4) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured; or (b) the transaction in question failed to satisfy applicable legal capital requirements, the court could determine that the Spin-Off was voidable, in whole or in part. Subject to various defenses, the court could then require us or other recipients of value in connection with the Spin-Off (potentially including our shareholders as recipients of shares of the common stock of MFS in connection with the Spin-Off), as the case may be, to turn over value to other entities involved in the Spin-Off and contemplated transactions for the benefit of unpaid creditors. The measure of insolvency and applicable legal capital requirements will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nSales of our products are cyclical and/or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors can have a material adverse effect on us.\nHistorically, sales of products that we manufacture and sell have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the demand for our Crane products is cyclical and is impacted by the strength of the economy generally, the availability of financing and other factors, including crude oil prices, that may have\nan effect on the level of construction activity on an international, national or regional basis. During periods of expansion in construction activity, we generally have benefited from increased demand for our products. Conversely, during recessionary periods, we have been adversely affected by reduced demand for our products. In addition, the strength of the economy generally may affect the rates of expansion, consolidation, renovation and equipment replacement within the restaurant, lodging, convenience store and healthcare industries, which may affect the performance of our Foodservice segment. Furthermore, any future economic recession may impact leveraged companies, such as Manitowoc, more than competing companies with less leverage and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducts in our Crane segment also depend in part on federal, state, local and foreign governmental spending and appropriations, including infrastructure, security and defense outlays. Reductions in governmental spending can reduce demand for our products, which in turn can affect our performance. Weather conditions can substantially affect our Foodservice segment, as relatively cool summer weather and cooler-than-normal weather in hot climates tend to decrease sales of ice and beverage dispensers. Our sales depend in part upon our customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently adjust to market conditions, among other potential adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we could fail to deliver on planned results, fall short of analyst and investor expectations, incur high fixed costs, and/or fail to benefit from higher than expected customer demand resulting in loss of market share.\nOur operational results are dependent on how well we can scale our manufacturing capacity and resources to the level of our customers\u2019 demand.\nWe operate in industries that require manufacturers to make highly efficient use of manufacturing capacity. Insufficient or excess capacity threatens our ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose us to liabilities related to contract commitments. Adapting or modifying our capacity is difficult, as modifications take substantial time to execute and, in some cases, may require regulatory approval. Additionally, delivering product during process or facility modifications requires special coordination. The cost and resources required to adapt our capacity, such as through facility acquisitions, facility closings, or process moves between facilities, may negate any planned cost reductions or may result in costly delays, product quality issues or material shortages, all of which could adversely affect our operational results and our reputation with our customers.\nPrice increases in some materials and sources of supply could affect our profitability.\nWe use large amounts of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper and electronic controls, among other items, in the manufacture of our products. Occasionally, market prices of some of our key raw materials increase significantly. If in the future we are not able to reduce product costs in other areas or pass raw material price increases on to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers - including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies or other natural disasters - may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nTo better manage our exposures to certain commodity price fluctuations, we regularly hedge our commodity exposures through financial markets. Through this hedging program we fix the future price for a portion of these commodities utilized in the production of our products. To the extent that our hedging is not successful in fixing commodity prices that are favorable in comparison to market prices at the time of purchase, we would experience a negative impact on our profit margins compared to the margins we would have realized if these price commitments were not in place, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon our ability to attract and retain key executives, managers and skilled personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have an adverse effect, at least in the short to medium term, on significant aspects of our business, including strategic planning and product development. Generally, our key employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our key officers and employees and the risks may increase as a result of or following the Spin-Off. If certain subject-matter experts or employees with specialized skills move to employment elsewhere, we will incur significant costs in hiring, training, developing and retaining their replacements.\nBecause we participate in industries that are highly competitive, our net sales and profits could decline as we respond to competition.\nWe sell most of our products in highly competitive industries. We compete in each of those industries based on product design, quality of products, quality and responsiveness of product support services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. We cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not accept them, our results would be negatively affected.\nOur products must be kept current to meet our customers\u2019 needs. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products on an on-going basis, and we invest significantly in the research and development of new products. If we do not successfully develop innovative products, it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products and satisfy regulatory requirements, and our sales and results would suffer.\nIf we do not meet customers\u2019 product quality and reliability standards/expectations, we may experience increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers' decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share, loss of revenue, reduced profitability, an increase in warranty costs and/or damage to our reputation.\nProduct quality and reliability are determined in part by factors that are not entirely within our control. We depend on our suppliers for parts and components that meet our standards. If our suppliers fail to meet those standards, we may not be able to deliver the quality of products that our customers expect, which may impair revenue and our reputation and lead to higher warranty costs.\nWe provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months with certain equipment having longer term warranties. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our customers rely on financing with third parties to purchase our products, and we may incur expenses associated with our assistance to customers in securing third party financing.\nA portion of our sales is financed by third-party finance companies on behalf of our customers. The availability of financing from third parties is affected by general economic conditions, the creditworthiness of our customers and the estimated residual value of our equipment. In certain transactions we provide residual value guarantees and buyback commitments to our customers or the third-party financial institutions. Deterioration in the credit quality of our customers or the overall health of the banking industry could negatively impact our customer\u2019s ability to obtain the resources needed to make purchases of our equipment or their ability to obtain third-party financing. In addition, if the actual value of the equipment for which we have provided a residual value guaranty declines below the amount of our guaranty, we may incur additional costs, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant manufacturing and sales of our products outside of the United States, which may present additional risks to our business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 46%, 50% and 51%, respectively, of our net sales were attributable to products sold outside of the United States. Expanding the company\u2019s international sales is part of our growth strategy. International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, military, religious and economic\ninstability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs, the impact of foreign government regulations, the effects of income and withholding tax, governmental expropriation, and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with our international sales, manufacturing and the integration of new facilities that could cause loss of revenue or increased cost. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate and currency devaluations of various foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products, especially our crane products. Certain of our businesses also have experienced claims relating to past asbestos exposure. Neither we nor our affiliates have to date incurred material costs related to these asbestos claims. We vigorously defend ourselves against current claims and intend to do so against future claims. However, a substantial increase in the number of claims that are made against us or the amounts of any judgments or settlements could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur patents, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our businesses. Although we intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Third parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs and in a diversion of our resources. In addition, if a third party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations and profitability could suffer if we experience problems with labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 11,000 people and had labor agreements with 13 local unions in North America. A large majority of our European employees belong to European trade unions. We have three trade unions in China and one trade union in India. During 2015, three of our union contracts expired and were successfully renegotiated without incident. In 2016, six union contracts will expire. Any significant labor relations issues could have an adverse effect our operations, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur leverage may impair our operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt was $1,413.6 million as compared to consolidated debt of $1,523.5 million as of December 31, 2014, including the value of related interest rate hedging instruments. If the Spin-Off is completed, on March 4, 2016, as currently planned, we expect to incur substantial indebtedness in connection with the Spin-Off, including $260 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.75% senior secured second lien notes due 2021 and as much as $225 million in borrowings under a new asset-based credit facility, as well as capital leases and other debt. We also expect to enter into a securitization facility pursuant to which we can securities our trade receivables. If the Spin-Off is completed, we plan to use the proceeds from these new debt facilities, together with the proceeds of a cash dividend paid by MFS to us, to repay or otherwise terminate our currently existing debt facilities.\nThe combined nature of our enterprise, including both the cranes and foodservice businesses, has historically enabled us to assist with working capital requirements on a short-term basis and provided other financial support functions. After the Spin-Off, we will not be able to rely on MFS\u2019s earnings, assets or cash flows, and we will be responsible for servicing our own debt, obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and paying dividends.\nIn addition, our debt could have important consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest rather than to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate.\nThe agreements governing our debt include covenants that restrict, among other matters, our ability to incur additional debt; pay dividends on or repurchase our equity; make investments; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. Certain of our debt facilities require or will require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants may also require that we take disadvantageous actions, including reducing spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. Our substantial leverage could also put us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. We cannot be certain that we will meet any future financial tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests. See additional discussion in Notes 13, \u201cDebt,\u201d and 27, \u201cSubsequent Events,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we default under our debt agreements, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and could proceed against any collateral securing the debt. Under those circumstances, in the absence of readily-available refinancing on favorable terms, we might elect or be compelled to enter bankruptcy proceedings, in which case our shareholders could lose the entire value of their investment in our common stock.\nAn inability to successfully manage the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system in our Crane segment could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system in the Crane segment. This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Should the system not be implemented successfully and within budget, or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could be disruptive and adversely affect our operations and results of operations, including the ability of the company to report accurate and timely financial results.\nWe are exposed to the risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe expect to incur in the future indebtedness that accrues interest at a variable rate, including a new asset-based credit facility. Increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions or dividends. In such cases we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but hedging our exposure carries the risk that we may forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates were to change in our favor. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy is guaranteed to completely insulate us from the risks associated with such fluctuations.\nAdditionally, some of our operations are or will be conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries will be reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, which are stated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between many of these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Such fluctuations may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nWe also incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a transaction using a different currency than its functional currency. We attempt to reduce currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a material transaction using a different currency than its functional currency by:\n\u2022\nmatching cash flows and payments in the same currency;\n\u2022\ndirect foreign currency borrowing; and\n\u2022\nentering into foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes.\nHowever, we may not be able to hedge this risk completely or at an acceptable cost, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nChanges to tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.\nTax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations. We regularly undergo tax audits in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination\nwith respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments.\nOur business and/or reputation could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nCertain of our shareholders have publicly or privately expressed views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters that may not be fully aligned with our own. Responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nActivist shareholders have made, and may in the future make, strategic proposals, suggestions, or requests for changes concerning the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations, or other matters. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any consequences arising from these actions, and any such consequences may impact the value of our securities.\nEnvironmental liabilities that may arise in the future could be material to us.\nOur operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. As a result, we are involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental and health and safety matters, and have in the past and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures relating to such matters.\nWe cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities, or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, compliance costs and/or penalties that could be material. Further, environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they may have upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our internal and external data centers, cloud services, and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure would compromise our networks and/or that of our partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and/or cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to recover from natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control, such as natural or manmade disasters, national emergencies, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, war or terrorist activities that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders. In addition, we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers, and, even if our facilities were not directly affected by such events, we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers. Such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. We cannot assure you that we will have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, customs, export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violation of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\nIn recent years, governments in both the U.S. and Europe have implemented or proposed regulations governing the use of certain minerals, including tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (\u201cconflict minerals\u201d). In the U.S., SEC rules require disclosures related to the use of conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC-reporting company, that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries in central Africa. In the European Union, proposed regulations would require similar disclosures, and may encompass other geographic regions outside of central Africa.\nThese disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of our products. Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to conclusively verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are \u201cconflict free,\u201d we may face reputational challenges with our customers or investors. Furthermore, we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as \u201cconflict free,\u201d which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Finally, because European regulations have not yet been finalized, it is difficult for us to determine whether and how we will establish a compliance program. For all of these reasons, we could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, and face equally significant costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.", "PERMNO": 51263, "SIC": 3530, "TIC": "MTW"}
