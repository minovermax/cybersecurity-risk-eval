{"cik": "1634447", "company": "Jensyn Acquisition Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those specific to the Company that we currently believe have the potential to be material, but they may not be the only ones we face. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Investors are advised to consider these factors along with the other information included in this Annual Report and to review any additional risks discussed in our filings with the SEC.\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nWe are a development stage company with no operating history and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nBecause we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to complete our initial Business Combination with one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a Business Combination and may be unable to complete our Business Combination. If we fail to complete our Business Combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\nIf we are unable to consummate our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait until after July 2, 2019 before receiving distributions from the Trust Account.\nWe will have until July 2, 2019 to consummate our initial Business Combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless we consummate our initial Business Combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert their shares. Only after the expiration of this full time period will holders of our Common Stock be entitled to distributions from the Trust Account if we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination. Accordingly, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate their investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed Business Combination.\nStockholders will have an opportunity to vote upon the Peck Electric Business Combination; however, if we pursue a Business Combination other than the Peck Electric Business Combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, in each case subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Accordingly, it is possible that we will consummate our initial Business Combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of the Business Combination. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. For instance, Nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any Business Combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a Business Combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such Business Combination instead of conducting a tender offer.\nOur public stockholders will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.\nSince the remaining net proceeds of the Public Offering are intended to be used to complete our initial Business Combination, we may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, since we had net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,001 upon the closing of our Public Offering and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would, for example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months of the effective date of the initial registration statement and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, our Units became immediately tradable, we are entitled to withdraw certain amounts from the funds held in the Trust Account prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination and we have a longer period of time to complete such a Business Combination than we would if we were subject to Rule 419.\nIf we determine to change our acquisition criteria or guidelines, many of our previously disclosed acquisition criteria and guidelines would no longer apply.\nThe proposed Peck Electric Business Combination is except as for size, generally consistent with our previously disclosed acquisition criteria and guidelines. If we seek to pursue a Business Combination other than the Peck Electric Business Combination, we could seek to deviate from our previously disclosed acquisition criteria and guidelines although we have no current intention to do so. For instance, as required by Nasdaq, we currently anticipate structuring a Business Combination with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value that is at least equal to 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter\u2019s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a letter of intent or definitive agreement for a Business Combination. However, we could be delisted from Nasdaq and therefore no longer be required to meet this requirement. Furthermore, there are numerous agreements between us and our affiliates that could be amended between the parties without approval of public stockholders. In such event, many of the acquisition criteria and guidelines set forth in this Annual Report (such as the voting, transfer and liquidation restrictions agreed to by the holders of the Insider Shares described in the prospectus associated with the Public Offering, the indemnification obligations of our insiders described below and the obligations of our insiders to pay the cost of liquidation if the funds held outside the Trust Account are insufficient for such purposes) may no longer apply.\nIf we deviate from our previously disclosed acquisition criteria or guidelines, holders of our securities may have rescission rights or may bring an action for damages against us or we could be subject to civil or criminal actions taken by governmental authorities.\nThe proposed Peck Electric Business Combination is except as for size, generally consistent with our previously disclosed acquisition criteria and guidelines. If we were to pursue a different Business Combination and elect to deviate from our previously disclosed acquisition criteria or guidelines, each person who purchased Units in the Public Offering and still held such securities upon learning of the facts relating to the deviation may seek rescission of the purchase of the Units he or she acquired in the Public Offering (under which a successful claimant has the right to receive the total amount paid for his or her securities pursuant to an allegedly deficient prospectus, plus interest and less any income earned on the securities, in exchange for surrender of the securities) or bring an action for damages against us (compensation for loss on an investment caused by alleged material misrepresentations or omissions in the sale of a security). In such event, we could also be subject to civil or criminal actions taken by governmental authorities. For instance, the SEC can seek injunctions under Section 20(b) of the Securities Act if it believes a violation under the Securities Act has occurred or is imminent. The SEC can also seek civil penalties under Sections 20(d) and 24 if a party has violated the Securities Act or an injunctive action taken by the SEC or if a party willfully, in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Furthermore, Section 20 allows the SEC to refer matters to the attorney general to bring criminal penalties against an issuer.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock to complete our initial Business Combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of up to 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. As of March 20, 2019, there were approximately 10,039,818 authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock available for issuance (after appropriate reservation for the issuance of the shares (i) underlying the public rights and private rights issuable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, (ii) issuable upon exercise of the public warrants and private warrants, and (iii) underlying the unit purchase option being issued to Chardan and/or its designees). Although we have no commitment as of the date of this Annual Report other than our obligations under the Share Exchange Agreement, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of Common Stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination of Common Stock and preferred stock, to complete our initial Business Combination. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock:\n\u25cf may significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in our securities;\n\u25cf may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of Common Stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of Common Stock;\n\u25cf may cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of Common Stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of Common Stock.\nIf the Peck Electric Business Combination is consummated, we will issue at least 3,234,501 shares of our common stock to the Peck Stockholders, representing approximately 59% of our outstanding shares upon the completion of the transaction.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a Business Combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this Annual Report to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our Business Combination. However, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u25cf default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;\n\u25cf our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; and\n\u25cf limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe will be limited to the funds held outside of the Trust Account to fund our search for target businesses and to complete our initial business combination.\nOf the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement offering, $85,000 was initially available to us outside the Trust Account to fund our working capital requirements. Although we may use interest earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account to pay any tax obligations we may owe, interest earned on funds in the Trust Account may not be used to meet our working capital obligations. Accordingly, if we use all of the funds held outside of the Trust Account, we may not have sufficient funds available with which to structure, negotiate or close our initial Business Combination. In such event, we would need to borrow additional funds from our insiders, officers or directors to operate or may be forced to liquidate. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary, we may be forced to cease searching for a target business and may be unable to complete our initial Business Combination.\nWe may not have sufficient working capital to cover our operating expenses.\nFollowing the consummation of the Public Offering and after paying offering related expenses, the amounts available to us to pay our operating expenses have consisted primarily of the approximately $1,295,220 of loans and advances from our insiders and a related party, $700,000 that was paid to us by Oneness Global to fund transaction expenses in connection with the proposed business combination with Oneness Global and $248,000 loaned to us by Riverside Merchant Partners, LLC to fund expenses in connection with the Peck Electric Business Combination, and $85,000 from the Public Offering and Private Placement initially held outside of the Trust Account. Additionally, we have delayed payment of a significant portion of the $10,000 monthly fee payable to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC as a result of a determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial Business Combination, with any such unpaid amount accruing without interest and becoming due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial Business Combination. However, the amounts available to us, even if we continue to not pay the $10,000 monthly fee to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2018, we had only $30,929 of funds held outside the trust. As a result, we will need to borrow funds from our insiders, officers or directors or from third parties to continue to operate. Our Principal Shareholders and Special Advisors have agreed to loan us up to $1,700,000 in the aggregate, however if we are unable to obtain the necessary funds, we may be forced to cease searching for a target business and liquidate without completing our initial Business Combination.\nReimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and Business Combinations, could reduce the funds available to us to consummate a Business Combination. In addition, an indemnification claim by one or more of our officers and directors in the event that any of them are sued in their capacity as an officer or director could also reduce the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account.\nWe reimburse our insiders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets for a Business Combination. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, that, to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the Trust Account and the interest income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account that may be released to us, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial Business Combination. In addition, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law, we may be required to indemnify our officers and directors in the event that any of them are sued in their capacity as an officer or director. We have also entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and under Delaware law. In the event that we reimburse our insiders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates for out-of-pocket expenses prior to the consummation of a Business Combination or are required to indemnify any of our officers or directors pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of incorporation, Delaware law, or the indemnity agreements that we have entered into with them, we would use funds available to us outside of the Trust Account. Any reduction in the funds available to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to locate and investigate prospective target businesses and to structure, negotiate, conduct due diligence in connection with or consummate our initial Business Combination.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than approximately $11.20.\nOur placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the Trust Account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period, our insiders have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or prospective target business does not execute such a waiver. However, our insiders may not be able to meet such obligation as we have not required our insiders to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that our insiders will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, our insiders will not be liable to our public stockholders if they should fail to satisfy their obligations under this agreement and instead will only be liable to us. Therefore, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than the approximately $11.20 per share in trust as of March 20, 2019 due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $11.20.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nIf we have not completed our initial Business Combination by July 2, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of Common Stock and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We may not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nUnlike other blank check companies, our Units are comprised of Common Stock, warrants to purchase one-half of one share of our Common Stock and rights, rather than units comprised of Common Stock and warrants to purchase one share of our Common Stock.\nUnlike other blank check companies that sell units comprised of shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase one share of Common Stock in their initial public offerings, we issued Units comprised of shares of Common Stock, warrants to purchase one-half of one share of our Common Stock and rights automatically entitling the holder to receive one-tenth of a share of Common Stock upon consummation of our initial Business Combination. Neither the rights nor the warrants will have any voting rights and each will expire and be worthless if we do not consummate an initial Business Combination. Furthermore, no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. As a result, unless you acquire at least two warrants, you will not be able to receive a share of Common Stock upon exercise of your warrants. Accordingly, investors in the Public Offering were not issued as many shares as part of their investment as they may have in other blank check company offerings, which may have the effect of limiting the potential upside value of your investment in our company.\nHolders of Rights and Warrants will not have redemption rights if we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period.\nIf we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period and we redeem our outstanding public shares using the funds held in the Trust Account, the Rights and Warrants will expire and holders thereof will not receive any of such proceeds with respect to such Rights and Warrants, respectively.\nIf we pursue a Business Combination other than the Peck Electric Business Combination, we will be unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate.\nAlthough we intend to consummate the Peck Electric Business Combination, if we pursue a different Business Combination, we may consummate our initial Business Combination with a target business in any industry we choose and are not limited to any particular industry or type of business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately consummate our initial Business Combination. To the extent we complete our initial Business Combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. If we complete our initial Business Combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. We may not properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. An investment in our shares may not ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business.\nThe requirement that our initial Business Combination occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination may limit the type and number of companies that we may complete such a Business Combination with.\nPursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter\u2019s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination. Although the Peck Electric Business Combination will meet this test, this restriction may limit the type and number of companies that we may complete a Business Combination with if we pursue a Business Combination other than the Peck Electric Business Combination. If we are unable to locate a target business or businesses that satisfy this fair market value test, we may be forced to liquidate and you will only be entitled to receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account.\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial Business Combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\nWe may structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial Business Combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial Business Combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial Business Combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial Business Combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial Business Combination. None of our officers are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs (although we expect them to devote approximately 10 hours per week to our business) and, accordingly, they will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to their other business activities, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial Business Combination. In addition, we do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\nIf the Peck Electric Business Combination is completed, none of our officers and only two of our directors will remain as officers or directors of Jensyn after the completion of the transaction. If a Business Combination other than the Peck Electric Business Combination is pursued, the role of our key personnel after our initial Business Combination, however, remains to be determined. Although some of our key personnel may serve in senior management or advisory positions following our initial Business Combination, it is likely that most, if not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nOur officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to consummate our initial Business Combination with.\nWe may consummate a Business Combination with a target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. Our officers and directors may not have enough experience or sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding our initial Business Combination.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular Business Combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial Business Combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular Business Combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the completion of our Business Combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the Business Combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the Business Combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the Business Combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nOur insiders, officers, directors and their affiliates may be owed reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses which may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular Business Combination is most advantageous.\nOur insiders, officers, directors and their affiliates may incur out-of-pocket expenses in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and combinations. We have no policy that would prohibit these individuals and their affiliates from negotiating the reimbursement of such expenses by a target business. As a result, the personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nMembers of our management team may have affiliations with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nMembers of our management team may have affiliations with companies, including companies that are engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial Business Combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business. For a more detailed description of the potential conflicts of interest of our management, see the section titled, \u201cManagement - Conflicts of Interest.\u201d\nWe may engage in a Business Combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our executive officers, directors or insiders, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\nIn light of the involvement of our insiders, officers, directors and director nominees with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our insiders, officers, directors and director nominees. Our directors and director nominees also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under \u201cManagement - Conflicts of Interest.\u201d Our insiders, officers, directors and director nominees are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our Business Combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary discussions concerning a Business Combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a Business Combination, such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time), and we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the Business Combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a Business Combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our officers, directors or insiders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the Business Combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\nThe shares beneficially owned by our insiders, officers and directors will not participate in a redemption and, therefore, our insiders, officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial Business Combination.\nOur insiders, officers and directors have waived their right to convert their Insider Shares, Private Units, or to redemption rights with respect to their Insider Shares, Private Units if we are unable to consummate our initial Business Combination. Accordingly, these securities will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial Business Combination. Any Rights and Warrants they hold, like those held by the public, will also be worthless if we do not consummate an initial Business Combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a Business Combination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular Business Combination are appropriate and in our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nIf we are unable to consummate a Business Combination, any loans made by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates would not be repaid, resulting in a potential conflict of interest in determining whether a potential transaction is in our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nIn order to meet our working capital needs, our Principal Shareholders have agreed to loan us up to $1,700,000 in the aggregate. At December 31, 2018, $1,295,220 of such loans were outstanding. The loans are non-interest bearing and will be payable at the consummation of a Business Combination. If we fail to consummate a Business Combination within the required time period, the loans would not be repaid. Consequently, our directors and officers may have a conflict of interest in determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular Business Combination are appropriate and in our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOn March 4, 2019, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that we are not in compliance with Rule IM-5101-2 as a result of not having completed our initial business combination within 36 months of the effective date of our IPO registration statement. We have appealed Nasdaq\u2019s determination to delist our securities from the Nasdaq Capital Market and submitted to Nasdaq a plan for regaining compliance which describes the proposed Business Combination with Peck Electric. A hearing on this matter is scheduled for April 11, 2019. We cannot assure you that our appeal will be successful or that securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future or after the Business Combination. We intend to apply to continue to list our Common Stock on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cPECK\u201d upon the closing of the Peck Electric Business Combination. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. We must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders\u2019 equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 public holders). We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to meet these listing requirements.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may only be able to complete one Business Combination with the proceeds of the Public Offering, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.\nIt is likely we will consummate our initial Business Combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously consummate our initial Business Combination with several target businesses. By consummating a Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several Business Combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u25cf solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or\n\u25cf dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial Business Combination.\nAlternatively, if we determine to simultaneously consummate our initial Business Combination with several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other Business Combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the Business Combination. With multiple Business Combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the target companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable Business Combination or optimize our capital structure.\nIf our initial Business Combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many public stockholders may exercise conversion rights, we may either need to reserve part of the Trust Account for possible payment upon such conversion, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our initial Business Combination. In the event that the Business Combination involves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive Business Combination available to us.\nWe may be unable to consummate an initial Business Combination if a target business requires that we have a certain amount of cash at closing, in which case public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company and wait until our redemption of the public shares to receive a pro rata share of the Trust Account or attempt to sell their shares in the open market.\nA potential target may make it a closing condition to our initial Business Combination that we have a certain amount of cash in excess of the $5,000,001 of net tangible assets we are required to have pursuant to our organizational documents available at the time of closing. If the number of our public stockholders electing to exercise their conversion rights has the effect of reducing the amount of money available to us to consummate an initial Business Combination below such minimum amount required by the target business and we are not able to locate an alternative source of funding, we will not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. In that case, public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company and wait the full 24 months (assuming the period of time to complete a Business Combination has been extended by the full amount) in order to be able to receive a portion of the Trust Account, or attempt to sell their shares in the open market prior to such time, in which case they may receive less than they would have in a liquidation of the Trust Account.\nWe will offer each public stockholder the option to vote in favor of the proposed Business Combination and still seek conversion of his, her or its shares.\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve an initial Business Combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our sponsors, officers or directors) the right to have his, her or its shares of Common Stock converted to cash (subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Annual Report) regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such proposed Business Combination; provided that a stockholder must in fact vote for or against a proposed Business Combination in order to have his, her or its shares of Common Stock converted to cash. If a stockholder fails to vote for or against a proposed Business Combination, that stockholder would not be able to have his, her or its shares of Common Stock so converted. We will consummate our initial Business Combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 after the closing of the Business Combination and a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. At December 31, 2018 our net tangible assets were approximately $4,636,000. We expect that as a result of: a) the net tangible assets acquired as part of a Business Combination, (b) Company liabilities converted to equity, (c) new equity capital raised, or a combination thereof, will result in the net tangible assets of the Company being greater than $5,000,001. Therefore, we could still consummate a proposed Business Combination regardless of the number of common shares redeemed so long as a majority of shares voted at the meeting are voted in favor of the proposed Business Combination. This is different than other similarly structured blank check companies where stockholders are offered the right to convert their shares only when they vote against a proposed Business Combination. This threshold and the ability to seek conversion while voting in favor of a proposed Business Combination may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial Business Combination.\nA public stockholder that fails to vote either in favor of or against a proposed Business Combination will not be able to have his, her or its shares converted to cash.\nIn order for a public stockholder to have his, her or its shares converted to cash in connection with any proposed Business Combination, that public stockholder must vote either in favor of or against a proposed Business Combination. If a public stockholder fails to vote in favor of or against a proposed Business Combination, whether that stockholder abstains from the vote or simply does not vote, that stockholder would not be able to have his, her or its shares of Common Stock so converted to cash in connection with such Business Combination.\nPublic stockholders, together with any affiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup,\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering.\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve an initial Business Combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our insiders, officers or directors) the right to have his, her or its shares of Common Stock converted into cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such public stockholder, or any other person with whom he, she or it is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering. Generally, in this context, a stockholder will be deemed to be acting in concert or as a group with another stockholder when such stockholders agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of our equity securities. Accordingly, if you purchased more than 20% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering and our proposed Business Combination is approved, you will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional shares of Common Stock or sell them in the open market. The value of such additional shares may not appreciate over time following our initial Business Combination, and the market price of our shares of Common Stock may not exceed the per-share conversion price.\nWe may require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of Common Stock in connection with a proposed Business Combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial Business Combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he, she or it is voting for or against such proposed Business Combination, to demand that we convert his, her or its shares of Common Stock into a share of the Trust Account. We may require public stockholders seeking to convert their shares, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option, at least two business days prior to the vote on the initial Business Combination (a tender of shares is always required in connection with a tender offer). In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, this may not be the case. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a public stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of Common Stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed Business Combination is not approved.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of Common Stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above for conversion and such proposed Business Combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed Business Combination until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of Common Stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.\nBecause of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive Business Combination.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Therefore, our ability to compete in consummating our initial Business Combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing a Business Combination with certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination may delay the consummation of a transaction. Additionally, our rights and warrants, and the future dilution they represent (entitling the holders to receive shares of our Common Stock on exercise of the warrants or, with respect to the rights, on consummation of our initial Business Combination), may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial Business Combination.\nOur ability to consummate an attractive Business Combination may be impacted by the market for initial public offerings.\nOur efforts to identify a prospective target business has not been and will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region. If the market for initial public offerings is limited, we believe there will be a greater number of attractive target businesses open to consummating an initial Business Combination with us as a means to achieve publicly held status. Alternatively, if the market for initial public offerings is robust, we believe that there will be fewer attractive target businesses amenable to consummating an initial Business Combination with us to become a public reporting company. Accordingly, during periods with strong public offering markets, it may be more difficult for us to complete an initial Business Combination.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete our initial Business Combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular Business Combination.\nAlthough we believe that the remaining net proceeds of the Public Offering will be sufficient to allow us to consummate a Business Combination, including the Peck Electric Business Combination, the capital requirements for any other possible transaction remain to be determined. If the net proceeds of the Public Offering prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of the Business Combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, or the obligation to convert into cash a significant number of shares of Common Stock, we will be required to seek additional financing. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular Business Combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular Business Combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a Business Combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination.\nIf our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of Common Stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect our initial Business Combination.\nOur insiders are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of the Insider Shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the purchasers of the Private Units and our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the Private Units (and underlying securities of each) and any shares our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us commencing on the date that we consummate our initial Business Combination. The presence of these additional shares of Common Stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate our initial Business Combination or increase the cost of consummating our initial Business Combination with the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a Business Combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities because of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of Common Stock.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial Business Combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities,\neach of which may make it difficult for us to complete our Business Combination.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf registration as an investment company;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading \u201cinvestment securities\u201d constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a Business Combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earlier to occur of either: (i) the completion of our primary business objective, which is a Business Combination; or (ii) absent a Business Combination, our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $11.31 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, assuming Jensyn Capital, LLC contributes an additional $0.30 per share to the Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire worthless.\nThe requirement that we complete our initial Business Combination by July 2, 2019 may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating our initial Business Combination.\nWe have until July 2, 2019 to complete our initial Business Combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a Business Combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a Business Combination, knowing that if we do not complete a Business Combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete a Business Combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time limit referenced above.\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial Business Combination with and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed Business Combination.\nWe plan to seek a fairness opinion. from Primary Capital, LLC, an independent investment banking firm. However, if the Peck Electric Business Combination is not completed, we will only be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial Business Combination with if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our insiders, officers or directors. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain an opinion. Accordingly, investors may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed Business Combination.\nResources could be wasted in researching business combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $11.31 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire worthless.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial Business Combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial Business Combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $11.31 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, assuming that Jensyn Capital, LLC deposits an additional $0.30 per share in the Trust Account, and our public rights and public warrants will expire worthless.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an initial Business Combination.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal control and may require that we have such system of internal control audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management\u2019s evaluation of our system of internal control over financial reporting, although as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of an exemption to this requirement. Peck Electric is not currently subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Following the Peck Electric Business Combination or any other Business Combination, Peck Electric and any other target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal control. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such initial Business Combination.\nOur auditors have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately or on a timely basis. As a result, current and potential stockholders and potential acquisition targets could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm the trading price of our stock and make us less attractive to target companies that we seek to acquire.\nIn connection with its audits of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm identified that we had inadequate control procedures and a lack of supervisory review over the closing process. This control deficiency constitutes a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We plan to take steps to remedy this material weakness in junction with our Business Combination that will provide additional resources.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we would be permitted, and we intend to, omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as described above. We also intend to take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS Act from the requirements to submit say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute votes to our stockholders and we will avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first public sale of Units, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act.\nUntil such time that we lose \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status, it is unclear if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and our stock prices may be more volatile and could cause our stock prices to decline.\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nWe may effect our initial Business Combination with a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business\u2019 home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\n\u25cf rules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\u25cf tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u25cf regulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u25cf challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf cultural and language differences;\n\u25cf employment regulations;\n\u25cf crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\n\u25cf deterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we are unable to do so, our operations may suffer.\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination with a target business located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such target business will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination with a target business located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such target business is domiciled will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. The target business may not be able to enforce any of its material agreements in such jurisdiction and appropriate remedies to enforce its rights under such material agreements may not be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we consummate our initial Business Combination with a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Common Stock and could entrench management.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial Business Combination with some prospective target businesses.\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with any tender offer documents we may use, whether or not that are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may consummate our initial Business Combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16012, "SIC": 1700, "TIC": "PECK"}
