{"cik": "1313275", "company": "BRIGHTCOVE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully review the risk factors described below and those described in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K,\nin evaluating our business. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks related to our business\nWe have a history of losses, we may continue to incur losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have historically incurred significant losses in fiscal years from 2004 through 2020. Though we have not experienced a consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a consolidated net loss of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and a consolidated net loss of $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These losses were due to the substantial investments we made to build our products and services, grow and maintain our business and acquire customers. Key elements of our growth strategy include acquiring new customers and continuing to innovate and build our brand. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future due to expected increased sales and marketing expenses, operations costs, research and development costs and general and administrative costs and, therefore, our operating income may potentially decrease in the foreseeable future. In addition, as a public company we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Furthermore, to the extent that we are successful in increasing our customer base, we will also incur increased expenses because costs associated with generating and supporting customer agreements are generally incurred up front, while revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed term of the agreement. You should not rely upon our recent bookings or revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. We cannot assure you that we will sustain profitability in the future. If we are ultimately unable to continue generating sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets, remain profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, investors could lose their investment.\nSubstantially all of our revenue has historically come from a single product, Video Cloud.\nWe have historically been substantially dependent on revenue from a single product, Video Cloud, and we expect that revenue from Video Cloud will continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenue. Our business would be harmed by a decline in the market for Video Cloud, increased competition in the market for online video platforms, or our failure or inability to provide sufficient investment to support Video Cloud as needed to maintain or grow its competitive position.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe sell our products pursuant to agreements that are generally for annual terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires, and we have experienced losses of customers that elected not to renew, in some cases, for reasons beyond our control. For example, our largest customer during 2020 faced bankruptcy and, as a result, we lost substantially all of the revenue we expected to generate from this customer in 2020. In addition, even if subscriptions are renewed, they may not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms. As a result, our ability to retain our existing customers and grow depends in part on subscription renewals. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers\u2019 renewal rates have and may continue to fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the cost of our services and the cost of services offered by our competitors, a customer\u2019s ability to build a video streaming solution in-house,\nreductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels or the introduction by competitors of attractive features and functionality. If our customer\nretention rate decreases, we may need to increase the rate at which we add new customers in order to maintain and grow our revenue, which may require us to incur significantly higher sales and marketing expenses than we currently anticipate, or our revenue may decline. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed or affected.\nOur long term financial targets are predicated on bookings and revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve, which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nWe are projecting long-term bookings and revenue growth. Our projections are based on the expected growth potential in our premium customer base, as well as the market for on-demand\nsoftware solutions generally. We may not achieve the expected bookings and revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates, if customers do not purchase or renew subscriptions as we expect, and/or if we are not able to deliver products desired by customers and potential customers. Our long-term operating margin improvement targets are predicated on operating leverage as long term revenue increases and improved operating efficiencies from moving to additional cloud-based delivery of services, together with lower cost of goods sold, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue. If operating margins do not improve, our earnings could be adversely affected and the price of our securities could decline.\nThe actual market for our solutions could be significantly smaller than our estimates of our total potential market opportunity, and if customer demand for our services does not meet expectations, our ability to generate revenue and meet our financial targets could be adversely affected.\nWhile we expect strong growth in the markets for our products, it is possible that the growth in some or all of these markets may not meet our expectations, or materialize at all. The methodology on which our estimate of our total potential market opportunity is based includes several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge and customer experience. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our solutions could be significantly smaller than our estimates of our total potential market opportunity. If the customer demand for our services or the adoption rate in our target markets does not meet our expectations, our ability to generate revenue from customers and meet our financial targets could be adversely affected.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of the market for on-demand\nsoftware solutions.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our on-demand\nsolutions. As a result, widespread acceptance and use of the on-demand\nbusiness model is critical to our future growth and success. Under the perpetual or periodic license model for software procurement, users of the software would typically install and operate the applications on their hardware. Because many companies are generally predisposed to maintaining control of their information technology, or IT, systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to the concept of accessing software as a service provided by a third party. In addition, the market for on-demand\nsoftware solutions is still evolving, and competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels to change as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of solutions and different approaches to enable organizations to address their technology needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our products and may be unable to renew existing customer agreements or enter into new customer agreements at the same prices and upon the same terms that we have historically. If the market for on-demand\nsoftware solutions fails to grow, grows more slowly than we currently anticipate or evolves and forces us to reduce the prices we charge for our products, our bookings growth, revenue, gross margin and other operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make them difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly operating results are tied to certain financial and operational metrics that have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance. Our operating results depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. In addition to the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, the following risks could cause our operating results to fluctuate:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nthe rates at which our customers renew;\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenue generated from our customers\u2019 use of our products or services in excess of their committed contractual entitlements;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of costs of new and existing sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of the development and introduction of new product and service offerings by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nimpacts on the national and global economies due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, social upheaval, governmental instability, or public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19\npandemic;\n\u2022\nsystem or service failures (including service failures from third party providers on which we rely), security breaches or network downtime.\nWe operate in a rapidly developing market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\nThe market for our products and services is rapidly developing, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including those related to:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our current and future products and services;\n\u2022\ncustomer renewal rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the market for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with customers or prospective customers that develop in-house\nsolutions instead of purchasing our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully expand our business, especially internationally;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expenses, related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages or security breaches and any associated expenses;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully manage acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nIf we do not manage these risks successfully, our business will be harmed.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our products to customers located outside of the United States, and thus our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe currently maintain offices and have sales personnel in Australia, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Mexico, Philippines, Portugal, Germany, and the United Kingdom, and we intend to expand our international operations. Any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022\nunexpected costs and errors in the localization of our products, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other barriers;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing systems integrators and technology partners;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates that may increase the volatility of our foreign-based revenue;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax (or other tax) systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nuncertain political and economic climates (including, for example, the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, or EU, on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d, which has created economic and political uncertainty in the EU); and\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThese factors may cause our costs of doing business in these geographies to exceed our comparable domestic costs. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. Any negative impact from our international business efforts could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition as a whole.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally left the European Union, or EU, (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), however there was an initial transition period until December 31, 2020 during which EU rules and legislation continued to apply. Since then, the U.K. and the EU have signed a EU-UK\nTrade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, which became provisionally applicable on January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA provides details on how some aspects of the U.K. and EU\u2019s relationship will operate going forwards (including certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues), however there are still many uncertainties. The uncertainties concerning the U.K.\u2019s legal, political and economic relationship with the EU following Brexit may continue to be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations and otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements, whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise.\nThe full effects of Brexit will depend on how the terms of the TCA and any future agreements signed by the U.K. and EU play out in practice. At this time, we therefore cannot predict the impact that Brexit will have on our business. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, which could present new regulatory costs and challenges (including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the U.K. and new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by such uncertainty with potential disruptions to our relationships with existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, all possibly having a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must keep up with rapid technological change to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving industry.\nOur markets are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt quickly to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services and products to evolving industry standards and to improve the performance and reliability of our services and products. To achieve market acceptance for our products, we must effectively anticipate and offer products that meet changing customer demands in a timely manner. Customers may require features and functionality that our current products do not have. If we fail to develop products that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to renew our contracts with existing customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our products will be harmed.\nWe may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of new products and enhancements. The introduction of new products by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could render our existing or future products obsolete.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new features and functionality, enhance our existing products to anticipate and meet customer requirements or sell our products into new markets, our bookings growth, revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition and may be unsuccessful against current and future competitors. If we do not compete effectively, our operating results and future growth could be harmed.\nWe compete with video sharing sites, in-house\nsolutions, online video platforms and certain niche technology providers, as well as larger companies that offer multiple services, including those that may be used as substitute services for our products. Competition is already intense in these markets and, with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to further intensify in the future. In addition, some of our competitors may make acquisitions, be acquired, or enter into strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive service than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions.\nDemand for our services is sensitive to price. Many factors, including our marketing, customer acquisition and technology costs, commoditization of our products and services and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly affect our pricing strategies. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced to engage in price-cutting initiatives, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, operating results and resources.\nWe will likely encounter significant, growing competition in our business from many sources, including portals and digital media retailers, search engines, social networking and consumer-sharing services companies,\nbroadband media distribution platforms, technology suppliers, direct broadcast satellite television service companies and digital and traditional cable systems. Many of our present and likely future competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, technological and other resources than we do. Some of these companies may even choose to offer services competitive with ours at no cost as a strategy to attract or retain customers of their other services. Technological and commercial developments may lead to the increasing commoditization of our products and services, including content delivery and storage, further increasing downward pressure on the prices we can charge. If we are unable to compete successfully with traditional and other emerging providers of competing services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe effects of the COVID-19\npandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19,\nas a pandemic. The COVID-19\npandemic, which has continued to spread and develop new variants in the two years since, and the related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place,\ntravel restrictions, and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours.\nIn March 2020, we temporarily closed each of our global offices and required our employees to work remotely until the summer of 2021. We continued to operate with a remote workforce in 2021, while also carefully opening some of our offices to provide employees with the option of working from an office if they so chose. We continue to monitor and follow local requirements with respect to safety measures in each office location. We also suspended most of our company-related travel, shifted our annual customer conference, internal sales kickoff event, and partner events to virtual-only experiences, and have canceled our participation at other customer and industry events. We may deem it advisable to alter, postpone, or cancel our participation at customer, employee, or industry events in the future. These changes have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the way we operate our business.\nMoreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19\npandemic and its aftermath can affect the rate of spending on software products and the demand for video to support virtual events. This could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our offerings, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, increase pressure for pricing discounts, lengthen payment terms, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, increase customer attrition rates, or attend our events, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance.\nOur operations have also been negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19\npandemic that are not within our control. For example, many cities, counties, states, and even countries have imposed or may impose a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees, partners and customers to limit the spread of COVID-19,\nincluding physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential\nbusiness, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place\norders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. If the COVID-19\npandemic has a substantial impact on the productivity of our employees and partners, or a continued substantial impact on the ability of our employees to execute responsibilities, or a continued and substantial impact on the ability of our customers to purchase our offerings, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19\npandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus (including its variants), the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the disruption caused by such actions, and the\nimpact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.\nTo the extent the COVID-19\npandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nRisks related to our operations\nIf we do not successfully manage the transition associated with the planned retirement of our Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and the appointment of a new CEO, it could be viewed negatively by our customers and shareholders and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nEffective March 28, 2022, Jeff Ray will step down from his position as the Company\u2019s CEO and as a member of the Board and Marc DeBevoise has been appointed in his stead. Mr. Ray will remain with the Company as an advisor, assisting with the leadership transition, until December 31, 2022. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition of our CEO may cause disruption to our business, including to our relationships with customers, vendors and employees.\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our executive officers, senior management team and key technical employees, and the loss of any key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers, senior management team and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Each of our executive officers, senior management team, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of any member of our senior management team or key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and our customer relationships. In addition, because of the nature of our business, the loss of any significant number of our existing engineering, project management and sales personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our business and operations, as well as organizational changes, have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and infrastructure. If we fail to manage these changes effectively and successfully recruit additional highly-qualified employees, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nOur business, headcount and operations have grown, both domestically and internationally, since our inception. In addition, we have seen organizational changes during that time, including the addition of several new members to our senior leadership team in the past several years. This growth and these organizational changes have placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate further growth will be required to address increases in our product and service offerings and continued international expansion. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior leadership team to manage Brightcove effectively. To do so, we must continue to recruit, hire, train, manage and integrate a significant number of qualified managers, technical personnel and employees in specialized roles within our company, including in technology, sales and marketing. If our new employees perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in recruiting, hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or retaining these or our existing employees, our business may suffer.\nIn addition, to manage the expected continued growth of our business, headcount, operations and geographic expansion, we will need to continue to improve our information technology infrastructure, operational, financial and management systems and procedures. Our expected additional headcount and capital investments will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to address any future revenue shortfalls by reducing\nexpenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth we will be unable to successfully execute our business plan, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPotential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and impair our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may continue to consider acquisitions of companies, technologies and products that we believe could accelerate our ability to compete in our core markets or allow us to enter new markets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, products, operations and existing contracts of a target company and realizing the anticipated benefits of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the personnel of a target company;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of a target company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or a target company\u2019s business; and\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nAcquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results.\nWe may experience delays in product and service development, including delays beyond our control, which could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives and hurt our business.\nMany of the problems, delays and expenses we may encounter may be beyond our control. Such problems may include, but are not limited to, problems related to the technical development of our products and services, problems with the infrastructure for the distribution and delivery of online media, including those from third party providers on which we rely, the competitive environment in which we operate, marketing problems, consumer acceptance and costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. Problems, delays or expenses in any of these areas could have a negative impact on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nDelays in the timely design, development, deployment and commercial operation of our product and service offerings, and consequently the achievement of our revenue targets and positive cash flow, could result from a variety of causes, including many causes that are beyond our control. Such delays include, but are not limited to, delays in the integration of new offers into our existing offering, changes to our products and services made to correct or enhance their features, performance or marketability or in response to regulatory developments or otherwise, delays encountered in the development, integration or testing of our products and services and the infrastructure for the distribution and delivery of online media and other systems, unsuccessful commercial launches of new products and services, delays in our ability to obtain financing, insufficient or ineffective marketing efforts and slower-than-anticipated consumer acceptance of our products. Delays in any of these matters could hinder or prevent our achievement of our growth objectives and hurt our business.\nRisks related to our intellectual property and third-parties\nOur business may be adversely affected by third-party claims, including by governmental bodies, regarding the content and advertising distributed through our service.\nWe rely on our customers to secure the rights to redistribute content over the Internet, and we do not screen the content that is distributed through our service. There is no assurance that our customers have licensed all rights necessary for distribution, including Internet distribution. Other parties may claim certain rights in the content of our customers.\nIn the event that our customers do not have the necessary distribution rights related to content, we may be required to cease distributing such content, or we may be subject to lawsuits and claims of damages for infringement of such rights. If these claims arise with frequency, the likelihood of our business being adversely affected would rise significantly. In some cases, we may have rights to indemnification or claims against our customers if they do not have appropriate distribution rights related to specific content items, however there is no assurance that we would be successful in any such claim.\nWe operate an \u201copen\u201d publishing platform and do not screen the content that is distributed through our service. Content may be distributed through our platform that is illegal or unlawful under international, federal, state or local laws or the laws of other countries. In the event that our customers distribute content that is deemed illegal, we would be required to cease distributing such content. We may face lawsuits, claims or even criminal charges for such distribution, and we may be subject to civil, regulatory or criminal sanctions and damages for such distribution. Any such claims or investigations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies providing Internet-related products and services are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims, some of whom have sent letters to and/or filed suit alleging infringement against some of our customers. From time to time, third parties claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. Additionally, the defense or prosecution of claims could be time-consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention away from the execution of our business plan.\nMoreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license from the third party asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all, or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, our affected product or service. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us. An adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products or services to others. Infringement claims asserted against us may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur agreements with customers often include contractual obligations to indemnify them against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. The results of any intellectual property\nlitigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u2022\nredesign those products or services to avoid infringement.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nBecause our business depends substantially on our intellectual property, the protection of our intellectual property rights is important to the success of our business. We rely upon a combination of trademark, patent, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. These afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products, service, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Moreover, policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective. In addition, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our patent rights, trade secrets, trademarks and domain names, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation or proceedings may be very costly and impact our financial performance. We may also incur substantial costs defending against frivolous litigation or be asked to indemnify our customers against the same. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may prove to be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our operating results.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions, as we have less opportunity to have visibility into the development process with respect to acquired technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our technology, business operations and business plans. In order to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, we rely in significant part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors, advisers and customers. These agreements may not be effective to prevent disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. To the extent that our employees and others with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how\nand inventions. Laws regarding trade secret rights in certain\nmarkets in which we operate may afford little or no protection to our trade secrets. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of the technology licensed by us incorporates \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate or use open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our services that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or alterations under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our services that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services.\nThere is no assurance that the current cost of Internet connectivity and network access will not rise with the increasing popularity of online media services.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for our principal connections to the Internet and network access, and to deliver media to consumers. As demand for online media increases, there can be no assurance that Internet and network service providers will continue to price their network access services on reasonable terms. The distribution of online media requires delivery of digital content files and providers of network access and distribution may change their business models and increase their prices significantly, which could slow the widespread adoption of such services. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a reasonable price model in place to allow for the continuous distribution of digital media files. We have limited or no control over the extent to which any of these circumstances may occur, and if network access or distribution prices rise, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.\nFailure of our infrastructure for the distribution and delivery of online media could adversely affect our business.\nOur success as a business depends, in large part, on our ability to provide a consistently high-quality digital experience to consumers via our relationships and infrastructure for the distribution and delivery of online media generally. There is no guarantee that our relationships and infrastructure will not experience problems or other performance issues, which could seriously impair the quality and reliability of our delivery of digital media to end users. For example, we primarily use three content delivery networks, or CDNs, to deliver content to end users. If one or more of these CDNs were to experience sustained technical failures, it could cause delays in our service and we could lose customers. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our customers could experience service outages or service degradation that may subject us to financial penalties and liabilities and result in customer losses. In the past we have, on limited occasions, suffered temporary interruptions of certain aspects of our service, including our customers\u2019 ability to upload new content into our system, our customers\u2019 ability to access administrative control of their accounts, and our ability to deliver content to end users in certain geographic locations. These service interruptions were the results of human error, hardware and software failures or failures of third-party networks. On a limited number of occasions, these\nservice interruptions have required us to provide service credits to customers. We cannot guarantee that service interruptions will not occur again or predict the duration of interruptions of our service or the impact of such interruptions on our customers. Failures and interruptions of our service may impact our reputation, result in our payment of compensation or service credits to our customers, result in loss of customers and adversely affect our financial results and ability to grow our business. In addition, if AWS or our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales or if our delivery capabilities fail, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity or enable alternative delivery capability, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth.\nWe may have difficulty scaling and adapting our existing infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic and storage, technology advances or customer requirements.\nIn the future, advances in technology, increases in traffic and storage, and new customer requirements may require us to change our infrastructure, expand our infrastructure or replace our infrastructure entirely. Scaling and adapting our infrastructure is likely to be complex and require additional technical expertise. If we are required to make any changes to our infrastructure, we may incur substantial costs and experience delays or interruptions in our service. These delays or interruptions may cause customers and partners to become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing service providers. Our failure to accommodate increased traffic and storage, increased costs, inefficiencies or failures to adapt to new technologies or customer requirements and the associated adjustments to our infrastructure could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on software and services licensed from other parties. The loss of software or services from third parties could increase our costs and limit the features available in our products and services.\nComponents of our service and product offerings include various types of software and services licensed from unaffiliated parties. If any of the software or services we license from others or functional equivalents thereof were either no longer available to us or no longer offered on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to either redesign our services and products to function with software or services available from other parties or develop these components ourselves. In either case, the transition to a new service provider or an internally-developed solution could result in increased costs and could result in delays in our product launches and the release of new service and product offerings. Furthermore, we might be forced to temporarily limit the features available in our current or future products and services. If we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these software or service licenses, we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to license and integrate functional equivalents.\nIf our software products contain serious errors or defects, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle claims.\nComplex software applications such as ours often contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Despite internal testing and testing by our customers, our current and future products may contain serious defects, which could result in lost revenue, lost customers, slower growth or a delay in market acceptance.\nSince our customers use our products for critical business applications, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers. They could seek significant compensation from us for the losses they suffer. Although our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations. Even if not successful, a claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to sell our products.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our strategic partners or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer from the unauthorized disclosure of data, unauthorized access to the service and misuse of the service, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs and our business.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators, vendors, and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Cyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency and can include third parties gaining access to employee or customer data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, card skimming code, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. Any significant violations of data privacy or unauthorized disclosure of information could result in the loss of business, litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if a security breach occurs with respect to another software as a service, or SaaS, provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of the SaaS business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones.\nIt is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers, suppliers or other vendors.\nIf any such computer system failure, accident or security breach were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. These cyber-attacks could be carried out by threat actors of all types (including but not limited to nation states, organized crime, other criminal enterprises, individual actors and/or advanced persistent threat groups). In addition, we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors.\nAny security breaches, unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus or similar breach or disruption could result in loss of confidential information, personal data and customer content, damage to our reputation, early termination of our contracts, litigation, regulatory investigations, increased costs or other liabilities. If our security measures, or those of our partners or service providers, are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to confidential information, personal data or customer content, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer or we could incur significant liability. If the measures we have put in place to limit or restrict access to and use of functionality, usage entitlements and support for customers or prospective customers are breached, circumvented or ineffective as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to and use of functionality, usage entitlements and support, our business may suffer or we could incur significant liability and/or costs.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance\nrequirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe use a data center and cloud computing services facilities to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.\nWe manage our services and serve all of our customers from cloud computing services facilities, such as Amazon Web Services, as well as one physical data center facility. While we control the actual computer and storage systems upon which our software runs, and deploy them to these facilities, we do not control the operation or availability of these facilities.\nThe owners of these facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to new facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nAny changes in third-party service levels at these facilities or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to these facilities that affect our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, and cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates.\nThese facilities are vulnerable to damage or service interruption resulting from human error, intentional bad acts, security breaches, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures, global health emergencies such as the COVID-19\npandemic, and similar events. For example, on September 18, 2014, we suffered a service disruption resulting from a distributed denial-of-service\nattack at third-party data center facilities used by us. By September 20, 2014, we had restored the services impacted by the attack. We contacted federal law enforcement authorities regarding the denial-of-service\nattack and cooperated with them. We also conducted an assessment of our internet service providers and data center providers, potential future vulnerability to malicious activity, and the sufficiency of our infrastructure to withstand and recover rapidly from such attacks. While this matter did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not occur again, and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, or vandalism or other misconduct, or a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.\nRisks related to our finances\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency translation losses.\nWe currently have foreign sales denominated in Australian dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros, Japanese yen and New Zealand dollars and may, in the future, have sales denominated in the currencies of additional countries in which we establish or have established sales offices. In addition, we incur a portion of our operating expenses in British pounds sterling, Mexican Pesos, Euros, Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, other foreign currencies. Any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Global economic events, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, have and may continue to significantly impact local economies and the foreign exchange markets, which may increase the risks associated with sales denominated in foreign currencies. We have not previously engaged in foreign currency hedging. If we decide to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we may not be able to hedge effectively due to lack of experience, unreasonable costs or illiquid markets.\nFailure of our customers to pay the amounts owed to us, or to pay such amounts in a timely manner, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf any of our significant customers have insufficient liquidity, we could encounter significant delays or defaults in payments owed to us by such customers, and we may need to extend our payment terms or restructure\nthe receivables owed to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, including impacting the timing of revenue recognition. Any deterioration in the financial condition of our customers will increase the risk of uncollectible receivables. Global economic uncertainty, such as the economic instability and market volatility caused by the global COVID-19\npandemic, could also affect our customers\u2019 ability to pay our receivables in a timely manner or at all or result in customers going into bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings, which could also affect our ability to collect our receivables.\nWe may be required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions in the future, which may decrease sales, and we may be subject to liability for sales and use taxes and related interest and penalties on prior sales.\nState and local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. On June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair\nthat states can impose sales and use taxes on transactions made with out-of-state\nsellers. Following this ruling, certain states have enforced tax laws requiring taxation of out-of-state\npurchases. We have performed an assessment of sales taxes owed under the new court ruling, determined that we need to remit sales taxes to certain states, and we have remitted such taxes. There is a risk that states which do not currently impose taxes on out-of-state\npurchases will do so in the future. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we presently believe sales and use taxes are not due. We reserve estimated sales and use taxes in our financial statements but we cannot be certain that we have made sufficient reserves to cover all taxes that might be assessed.\nIf one or more taxing authorities determine that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to being required to collect sales or similar taxes in respect of our services going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include substantial interest and penalty charges. Our client contracts typically provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes. Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes or we may determine that it would not be feasible to seek reimbursement. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties and if our clients do not reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nRisks related to governmental regulation\nGovernment and industry regulation of the Internet is evolving and could directly restrict our business or indirectly affect our business by limiting the growth of our markets. Unfavorable changes in government regulation or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nFederal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy, content, and taxation of products and services. Government regulations could limit the market for our products and services or impose burdensome requirements that render our business unprofitable. Our products enable our customers to collect, manage and store a wide range of data. The United States and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities, or our customers may terminate their relationships with us.\nIn addition, although many regulations might not apply to our business directly, we expect that laws regulating the solicitation, collection or processing of personal and consumer information could affect our\ncustomers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, the California Consumer Privacy Act, along with other similar laws and regulations prohibit certain types of information and content from being transmitted over the Internet. The scope of these types of prohibitions in jurisdictions around the world and the liability associated with a violation are evolving. In addition, although substantial portions of the Communications Decency Act were held to be unconstitutional, we cannot be certain that similar legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the future. Legislation like the Telecommunications Act and the Communications Decency Act could dampen the growth in web usage and decrease its acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers\u2019 ability to use and share consumer data or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our products could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur\nbusiness\nis\nsubject\nto\na\nvariety\nof U.S. federal and state, as well as international\nlaws\nand\nregulations\n,\nincluding\nthose\nregarding\nprivacy\n,\ndata\nprotection\nand\ninformation\nsecurity\n,\nand\nour\ncustomers\nmay\nbe\nsubject\nto\nregulations\nrelated\nto\nthe\nhandling\nand\ntransfer\nof\ncertain\ntypes\nof\npersonal,\nsensitive\n,\nor\nconfidential\ninformation\n.\nAny\nfailure\nto\ncomply\nwith\napplicable\nlaws\nand\nregulations\nwould\nharm\nour\nbusiness\n,\nresults\nof\noperations\nand\nfinancial\ncondition\n.\nWe and our customers may be subject to privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations that impose obligations in connection with the collection, use, storage, transfer, dissemination, security, and/or other processing (\u201cProcessing\u201d) of personally identifiable information (such personally identifiable information collectively with all information defined or described by applicable law as \u201cpersonal data,\u201d \u201cpersonal information,\u201d \u201cPII\u201d or any similar term, \u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d) or other sensitive data. Existing U.S. federal and various state and foreign privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection-related matters. International jurisdictions in which we have customers or employees have established data security and privacy frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. In addition, our business may be impacted by new regulations and guidance over machine learning and automated processing. In the United States, certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. New laws, amendments to or re-interpretations\nof existing laws and regulations, rules of self-regulatory bodies, industry standards and contractual obligations may impact our business and practices, and we may be required to expend significant resources to adapt to these changes, or stop offering our products in certain countries. These developments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEurope\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) is of the most concern in this regard. The GDPR, effective since May 25, 2018, imposes strict regulations and establishes a series of requirements regarding the collection, transfer, storage and processing of personal data. The GDPR has extra-territorial application and applies where a company, based outside the European Union, processes personal data of individuals based in the European Union as a result of offering goods or services to individuals based in the EU and/or monitoring their behavior. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for data subjects residing in the EU. The GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal data, allows them to exercise certain data subject requests, including to request deletion of personal data in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal recourse in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes\nstrict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer \u201cadequate\u201d privacy protections. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and provides direct legal obligations for service providers processing personal data on behalf of customers, including with respect to cooperation with European data protection authorities, implementation of security measures and keeping records of personal data processing activities. Moreover, the GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger steep fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenues, whichever is higher. In addition, further to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK\u2019s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK\u2019s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU\u2019s data protection regime. Non-compliance\nwith the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to \u00a317.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU\u2019s GDPR, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.\nIn addition to the GDPR, the European Union is also in the process of replacing the e-Privacy\nDirective (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of the ePrivacy Regulation, which will be directly implemented in the laws of each European member state, without the need for further enactment. Certain jurisdictions are actively applying the ePrivacy Directive to enforce cookie consent and consent requirements generally under the GDPR. Originally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still going through the European legislative process. As of November 2021, the Council of the European Union and European Parliament are still in negotiations of a final draft for vote. Any passed Regulation would go into effect two years after it is passed. An update is expected in 2022. The aim is for the Draft Regulation to be in force some time in 2023. Preparing for and complying with the GDPR and the ePrivacy Regulation (if and when it becomes effective) has required and will continue to require us to incur substantial operational costs and may require us to change our business practices. Despite our efforts to bring practices into compliance with the GDPR and before the effective date of the ePrivacy Regulation, we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations and in inconsistency in interpretation of the law across EU regulatory bodies. Non-compliance\ncould result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, data subjects, consumer associations or others.\nThe EU-U.S.\nand the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks\nallowed U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. Recently, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the EU-U.S. Privacy\nShield is an invalid transfer mechanism, but upheld Standard Contractual Clauses as a valid transfer mechanism, provided they meet certain requirements. To enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with European and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC\u2019s new standard contractual clauses but has published a draft version of a UK-specific\ntransfer mechanism, which, once finalized, will enable transfers from the UK. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost.\nThe EU\u2019s data protection landscape is evolving with respect to transfers to US-based\nservice providers (processors) or those using US-based\ncloud service providers to process information collected in the EU,\nparticularly after the invalidation of the Privacy Shield and creation of new standard contractual clauses. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact, such as implementing the new standard contractual clauses and creating a risk assessment for transfers of personal information from our customers to the US, recent decisions indicate that the longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain and may continue to evolve. Further action in this area could increase the risk of continued transfers or create costs for engaging a EU-based\nprocessor or cloud-service provider. Compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or negatively affect the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business.\nIn the United States, many state legislatures have adopted or are considering legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy. California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or \u201cCCPA,\u201d which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA, effective since January 1, 2020, requires covered businesses, such as our company, to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out\nof certain sales or transfers of personal information. The California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), an amendment expanding the rights of the CCPA to other types of California residents goes into effect in 2023, creating a separate agency charged with enforcement and promulgating compliance guidelines. No regulations have been issued and the CPRA leaves many provisions up to the decision of this agency, making compliance efforts more uncertain. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. There continues to be uncertainty surrounding the enforcement and implementation of the CCPA exemplifying the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected information. These penalties have been unchanged by the CPRA, but businesses no longer have a guaranteed 30-day cure period.\nThe existence of privacy laws in different states in the United States will make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance and require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, and/or changes in business practices and policies.\nCurrent trends show those bills are very similar to obligations imposed by either the CCPA or GDPR, which makes our ability to adapt of current compliance programs to future privacy laws easier. However, even small deviations in definition could create compliance complexity for a business that relies heavily on device-based information.\nWith respect to all of the foregoing, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with U.S. federal or state, EU or other foreign privacy or data security laws, policies, industry standards or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized Processing of Personally Identifiable Information or other customer data may result in governmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable information privacy laws may involve substantial costs. Various jurisdictions around the world continue to propose new laws that regulate the privacy and/or security of certain types of personal data. Complying with these laws, if enacted, would require significant resources and leave us vulnerable to possible fines and penalties if we are unable to comply. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, or restructuring of our operations.\nRisk related to owning our common stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this report and other factors beyond our control. Market prices for securities of early stage companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some, but not all, of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or the quarterly or annual financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us or relevant for our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar or relevant companies;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive service offerings or technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as the issuance of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or by our competitors of significant services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u2022\nmarket volatility resulting from the COVID-19\npandemic;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perceptions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry or market conditions.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected if we are subject to stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense and impact the market price of our common stock.\nIn recent years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. Stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and our board of directors and resources from our business. Activist campaigns can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and harm our ability to attract new customers, employees and investors. In addition, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any activist stockholder matters. Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks, and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by research and reports that industry or security analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who\nmay cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe may be unable to meet our future capital requirements, which could limit our ability to grow.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months. We may, however, need, or could elect to seek, additional funding at any time. To the extent that existing resources are insufficient to fund our business operations, our future activities for the expansion of our service and our product offerings, developing and sustaining our relationships and infrastructure for the distribution and delivery of digital media online, marketing, and supporting our office facilities, we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Furthermore, if we issue equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing classes of stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in our failure to accurately report our financial results. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and adversely impact investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management, as well as our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and Delaware law, contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are selected at one time;\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe record substantial expenses related to our issuance of equity awards that may have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future.\nWe expect our stock-based compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods, which will have an adverse impact on our operating results. The model used by us to value stock options requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the price volatility of the option\u2019s underlying stock, the expected life of the options and the risk-free interest rate. This model does not include RSUs. If facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future period expenses may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based payments, our operating income, net income and net income per share.", "PERMNO": 13260, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "BCOV"}
