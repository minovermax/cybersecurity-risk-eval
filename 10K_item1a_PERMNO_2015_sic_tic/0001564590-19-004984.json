{"cik": "884219", "company": "VIAD CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to known and unknown risks. As a result, past financial performance and historical trends may not be reliable indicators of our future performance.\nCompleted acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned. We regularly evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance, or expand our current business, or offer growth opportunities. Our acquired businesses might not meet our financial and non-financial expectations or yield anticipated benefits. Our\nsuccess depends, in part, on our ability to conform controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and retain the acquired business\u2019s key personnel and customers. Moreover, our acquisition activity potentially subjects us to new regulatory requirements, distracts our senior management and employees, and exposes us to unknown liabilities or contingencies that we may fail to identify prior to closing. If our acquisitions cause us to make changes to our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may also be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets. Additionally, we may borrow funds to finance strategic acquisitions. Debt leverage resulting from future acquisitions would reduce our debt capacity, increase our interest expense, and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities. Such borrowings may also be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product and service sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRelated to our 2016 acquisition of ON Services, we have experienced a longer than anticipated integration that resulted in operational inefficiencies and operating performance below our expectations. We will continue to review the financial performance of ON Services in future quarters as new information becomes available. Changes to our assumptions or circumstances may result in impairment charges in the future.\nWe are vulnerable to deterioration in general economic conditions. Our business is sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets in which we operate. A decline in global or regional economic conditions, or consumers\u2019 fears that economic conditions will decline, could cause declining consumer confidence, unemployment, fluctuations in stock markets and interest rates, contraction of credit availability, or other dynamic factors affecting economic conditions generally. The success of our GES business largely depends on the number of exhibitions held, the size of exhibitors\u2019 marketing expenditures, and on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate. The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens. We also suffer from reduced spending for our services because many exhibitors\u2019 marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced when economic conditions deteriorate. Consequently, marketing expenditures reduced during a downturn are often not increased until economic conditions improve. In addition, travel and vacation spending is discretionary in nature. Revenue from our Pursuit operation depends largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations. This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on our large exhibition event clients to renew their service contracts and on our exclusive right to provide those services. During 2018, no single client accounted for more than 8% of our consolidated revenue. However, GES has a number of large exhibition event organizers and large customer accounts. If any of these large clients do not renew their service contracts, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMoreover, when event organizers hire GES as the official services contractor, they usually also grant GES an exclusive right to perform audio visual, electrical, plumbing, and other services (the \u201cEvent Services\u201d) at the exhibition facility. However, some exhibition facilities are under financial pressure to in-source certain Event Services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider) as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, such as an increased supply of exhibition space. If exhibition facilities choose to in-source Event Services, GES will lose the ability to provide certain Event Services despite being the official services contractor, and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is relationship driven. Our GES business is heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on having close collaboration and interaction with our clients. To be successful, our account teams must be able to understand clients\u2019 desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service. If we lose a key member of our account teams, we could also lose customers and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries. Competition in the Live Events markets is driven by price and service quality, among other factors. To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, we may be required to lower our prices and rates to avoid the loss of related business. Moreover, recent customer consolidations and other actions have caused downward pricing pressure for our products and services and could affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our customers. If we are unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, we could lose market share to our competitors. Our inability to meet the challenges presented by the competitive and dynamic environment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nTravel industry disruptions, particularly those affecting the hotel and airline industries, could adversely affect our business. Our business depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees, tourists, or others, to travel. Factors adversely affecting the travel industry, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect our business and results of operations. Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents, acts of terrorism, and international political instability and hostilities. Any of these factors, or other unexpected events that affect the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNew capital projects may not be commercially successful. From time to time, we pursue capital projects, such as our current construction of FlyOver Iceland and other efforts to upgrade some of our Pursuit offerings, in order to seize opportunities that complement, enhance, and expand our business. Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays, cost overruns, and the failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals, as well as additional risks specific to a project. The occurrence of any of these events could prevent a new capital project from performing in accordance with our commercial expectations and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe seasonality of our business makes us particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods. The peak activity for our Pursuit business is during the summer months. Consequently, during 2018, 87% of Pursuit\u2019s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters. Our GES exhibition and event activity varies significantly because it is based on the frequency and timing of shows, many of which are not held each year and which may shift between quarters. If adverse events or conditions occur during these peak periods, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTransportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations. GES relies on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibition, warehouse, and customer facilities. If our customers and suppliers are unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, labor strikes, lockouts, or other events could adversely affect our ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business. The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, accidents involving our travel offerings or experiences, or the prospect of these events could disrupt our business. Such catastrophic events have, and could have, an adverse impact on Pursuit, which is heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel and/or visit our attractions. Pursuit guests tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts, and attractions, and catastrophic events could impede the guests\u2019 ability to travel, and interrupt our business operations, including damaging our properties. Such catastrophic events could also have a negative impact on GES, causing a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or disrupt the services we provide to our customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels, and other public venues. They could also have a negative impact on GES\u2019 production facilities, preventing us from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers. In addition, unfavorable media attention, or negative publicity, in the wake of a catastrophic event could damage our reputation or reduce the demand for our services. If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, they could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of recent U.S. tax legislation may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted in late 2017, made significant changes to U.S. income tax laws that could affect our business. For instance, the limits on interest expense deductions, the limit on use of net operating losses, and the limitation on the use of certain foreign tax credits could adversely affect our results of operations; however, the expensing of certain capital assets is expected to be beneficial. In addition, application of new taxes based on certain international operations is still unclear and final regulations issued by the Department of Treasury may subject us to additional tax that could adversely affect our results of operations. Congress has indicated that it intends to issue a technical correction bill in 2019 that could lessen or increase the impacts on our results of operations. We believe we have complied with our obligations and applied the new tax laws correctly; however, if successfully challenged, the outcome could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans could substantially increase our pension costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for our U.S. and Canada-based employees. In addition, we are obligated to contribute to multi-employer pension plans under collective-bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees. We contributed $26.4 million in 2018, $26.6 million in 2017, and $25.8 million in 2016 to those multi-employer pension plans. Third-party boards\nof trustees manage these multi-employer plans. Based upon the information we receive from plan administrators, we believe that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires us to reduce the underfunded status over defined time periods. Moreover, we would be required to make additional payments of our proportionate share of a plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities if a plan terminates, or other contributing employers withdraw, due to insolvency or other reasons, or if we voluntarily withdraw from a plan. We are currently working with the Chicago Teamsters union leadership to finalize the terms of a new collective-bargaining agreement that includes a partial withdrawal from the Central States pension plan, which would trigger a partial withdrawal liability that is currently estimated at a net present value of approximately $14 million, payable over the next 20 years. At this time, we do not anticipate triggering any withdrawal from any other multi-employer pension plan to which we currently contribute. However, significant plan contribution increases could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Refer to Note 18 - Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K) for further information.\nUnion-represented labor increases our risk of higher labor costs and work stoppages. Significant portions of our employees are unionized. We have approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, and we are required to renegotiate approximately one-third of those each year. If we increase wages or benefits as a result of labor negotiations, either our operating margins will suffer, or we could increase the cost of our services to our customers, which could lead those customers to turn to other vendors with lower prices. Either event could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages. If that happens, we might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or we may incur additional costs to do so, both of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLiabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect our results of operations. We, and our predecessors, have a corporate history spanning decades and involving diverse businesses. Some of those businesses owned properties and used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, subject to litigation. Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts. In addition, we may incur other liabilities resulting from indemnification claims involving previously sold properties and subsidiaries, or obligations under defined benefit plans or other employee plans, as well as claims from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries. Although we believe we have adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those future liabilities, future events or proceedings could render our reserves or insurance protections inadequate, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nShow rotation affects our profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult. GES results are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing, and location of exhibitions and events. Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two, three, or four years) or may be held at different times of the year from when they were previously held. In addition, the same exhibition may change locations from year to year resulting in lower margins if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost location. Any of these factors could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.\nWe are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have operations outside of the U.S. primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries. During 2018, GES International and Pursuit\u2019s international operations accounted for approximately 31% of our consolidated revenue and 63% of our segment operating income. Consequently, a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the currency translation are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets. As a result, significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates could result in material changes to the net equity position we report in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not currently hedge equity risk arising from the translation of non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities.\nWe are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and threats. We regularly collect and process credit, financial, and other personal and confidential information from individuals and entities who attend or participate in events and exhibitions that we produce, or who visit our attractions and other offerings. In addition, our devices, servers, computer systems, and business systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk, including cyberattacks, or we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information and company assets. Despite our efforts to protect ourselves with insurance, and create security barriers to such threats, including regularly reviewing our systems for vulnerabilities and continually updating our\nprotections, we might not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Our failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of information security threats could lead to business interruptions, delays or loss of critical data, misuse, modification, or destruction of information, including trade secrets and confidential business information, reputational damage, and third-party claims, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data are evolving and could result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines. We store and process the personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, and third parties with whom we have business relationships. The legal requirements restricting the way we store, collect, handle, and transfer personal data continue to evolve, and there are an increasing number of authorities issuing privacy laws and regulations. These data privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and are creating uncertainty and inconsistency across jurisdictions. Our compliance with these myriad requirements could involve making changes in our services, business practices, or internal systems, any of which could increase our costs, lower revenue, or reduce efficiency. Our failure to comply with existing or new rules could result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, litigation, adverse publicity, or could cause our customers to lose trust in our services. In addition, if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations, or suffer a security breach, those violations could also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection, including insurance protection against such threats, as they develop in the future (or as legal requirements related to data security increase) are expected to increase and could be material. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business. We operate substantial parts of our EU businesses from U.K-based entities. The June 23, 2016 U.K. referendum resulted in a determination that the U.K. should exit the EU. In March 2017, the U.K. government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU, thereby setting a March 29, 2019 withdrawal date. In December 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that the U.K. could decide to stop the withdrawal and remain a member of the EU. The ruling increased the uncertainty surrounding the timing, terms, and consequences of the U.K.\u2019s exit. This uncertainty could have an adverse impact on customers, and cause our event organizer customers to relocate regional and global events outside of the U.K. Any of these scenarios could cause operational and logistic challenges for our businesses, could require us to shift our project planning, and could increase costs for our customers and clients. Moreover, if the U.K. exits from the EU, there could be delays in moving goods through border crossings, and the regulatory and legal environment that would then govern our U.K. operations will depend on the circumstances surrounding the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU. Any new arrangements may require us to make changes to our operations in Europe, which could result in a higher cost and less efficient operating model across our European business. These new arrangements could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The U.S. government has indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods and has raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases or expanding the tariffs to capture other types of goods. In response, certain foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the U.S. These actions have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries with respect to trade policies, treaties, and tariffs. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products from those countries. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers, which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products and services sold, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 19721, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "VVI"}
