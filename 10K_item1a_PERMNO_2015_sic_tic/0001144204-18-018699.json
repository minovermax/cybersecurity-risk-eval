{"cik": "1208261", "company": "IMMUNE PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially affect our business operations.\nRisks relating to our financial position and need for additional capital\nWe have limited liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $6.8 million, which we believe will not be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations for at least the next 12 months, and our working capital deficit as $2.2 million. Our cash used in operations was $11.6 million and $12.3 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe have financed our operations to date through private placements and public offerings of common and preferred stock and convertible debt securities and borrowings under secured loans. Our revenue to date has consisted of royalties on licensed patents and sales of Ceplene used in clinical trials.\nOur ability to continue operations depends on our ability to access the capital markets, license our technology to third parties and obtain regulatory approval to market our drugs. We expect to finance our cash needs from additional equity or debt financing, or strategic alliances on products until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, if ever.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of $17.9 million and $32.7 million, resulting in a total accumulated deficit of\u2009$113.5 million and $95.6 million, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to developing bertilimumab, NanoCyclo, Nano AmiKet and the products in our oncology portfolio. We are in the early stages of development of our product candidates and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we continue the research and development of our product candidates.\nWe must succeed in developing and commercializing products that generate significant revenue to become and remain profitable, which will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, and establishing and managing our collaborations at various stages of each candidate\u2019s development. We are in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nNone of our drug candidates has received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval (except Ceplene). In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that our clinical data and that of our collaborators establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates. Furthermore, our strategy includes entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products. In the event that third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect its development plan or capital requirements.\nWe are unable to predict accurately the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development. In addition, our expenses could increase and revenue could be further delayed if we are required by the FDA or EMA to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis even if we achieve profitability. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our Company could also cause you to lose part or all of your investment.\nThe estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Such estimates and judgments include revenue recognition, inventory, valuation of stock-based awards, research and development expenses and income tax. We base our estimates on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot provide assurances, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. If this is the case, we may be required to restate our consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, subject us to securities class action litigation. Defending against such potential litigation relating to a restatement of our consolidated financial statements would be expensive and would require significant attention and resources of our management. Moreover, our insurance to cover our obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any such litigation may be inadequate. As a result of these factors, any such potential litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cause our stock price to decline, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation.\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise the necessary additional capital, we will be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or continue our development programs.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception in 2010. We will require additional capital for the further development and commercialization of our product candidates and to fund our other operating expenses and capital expenditures.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may need to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We may need to seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that a large percentage of our future research and development expenses will be incurred in support of current and future preclinical and clinical development programs. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. We test our product candidates in numerous preclinical studies for toxicology, safety and efficacy. We then conduct early stage clinical trials for each drug candidate. As we obtain results from clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus resources on more promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials may take several years but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a drug candidate. The cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development.\nIn order to carry out our business plan and implement our strategy, we will need to obtain additional financing and may choose to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing, licensing arrangements, strategic collaborations, asset sales, government grants, or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity or equity-related financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt or equity financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. We may be required to relinquish our rights to certain of our product candidates or marketing territories if we obtain funding through licensing arrangements or strategic collaborations.\nIn addition, certain investors may be unwilling to invest in our securities if we are unable to maintain the listing of our common stock on a United States national securities exchange. Our inability to raise capital when needed would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause our stock price to decline or require that we wind down our operations altogether.\nWe have a limited operating history, expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses and may be unable to obtain additional financing, causing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months from the filing of this annual report. The report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe commenced operations in 2010. Our limited operating history hinders an evaluation of our prospects, which should be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a business in a new industry, characterized by a number of market entrants and intense competition, and in the shift from development to commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies.\nDue to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel to satisfy needs from expected growth. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability on the part of our management to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations. As a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors.\nThe Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2019s Report issued in connection with our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 states that there is \u201csubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on a combination of several factors, including, our ability to raise capital by issuing debt or equity securities to investors, license or sell our product candidates to other pharmaceutical companies, and generate revenues from successfully developed products. If we are not able to continue our business as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets for an amount less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose part or all of their investment.\nIn connection with the preparation of our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, our management has evaluated whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and has determined that substantial doubt existed based on the following factors: (i) our available cash as of the date of this filing will not be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations within 12 months after the financial statements were issued; (ii) we may not identify commercial partners to support development of its drug candidates; and (iii) if we fail to obtain needed capital, we will be forced to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of its R&D programs or perhaps cease operations. In the opinion of management, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of us to continue as a going concern.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued minimum closing bid requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) or other requirements for continued listing, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ. We must satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price requirement of\u2009$1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If a company\u2019s common stock trades for 30 consecutive business days below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ will send a deficiency notice to us, advising that it has been afforded a \u201ccompliance period\u201d of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the applicable requirements. Thereafter, if such a company does not regain compliance with the bid price requirement, a second 180-day compliance period may be available.\nOn December 1, 2017, we received a notification letter from NASDAQ informing us that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our securities had closed below $1.00 per share. This notice had no immediate effect on our NASDAQ listing and we have 180 calendar days, or until May 30, 2018, to regain compliance. The closing bid price of our securities must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days to regain compliance.\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement by May 30, 2018, or such further extended period as may be provided by NASDAQ, our securities may be delisted from NASDAQ, which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock materially and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and business development opportunities. Such a delisting likely would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. Further, if we were to be delisted from NASDAQ, our common stock may no longer be recognized as a \u201ccovered security\u201d and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Thus, delisting from NASDAQ could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly impact the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to license our product candidate AmiKet on terms that reflect the current carrying value of the asset, or at all, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe perform analyses periodically to determine whether an impairment exists related to any of our intangible non-depreciable assets. Our annual impairment analysis for 2016 determined that a change in the carrying value of in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) related to the AmiKet program (which includes AmiKet and AmKet Nano, a new and improved formulation of AmiKet using the nano-encapsulation technology that we licensed from Yissum) was required. As a result, we decreased the carrying value of the IPR&D asset from $27.5 million as of December 31, 2015 to $15.0 million as of December 31, 2016. An independent valuation of the IPR&D related to the AmiKet program as of December 31, 2017 confirmed that no change in the carrying value was required as of that date. There is no assurance that future analysis would not result in further impairment of the fair value attributable to the AmiKet IPR&D. If we are unable to successfully develop AmiKet or AmiKet Nano or if we sell or license AmiKet or AmiKet Nano on terms materially less favorable than the assumptions used in the current valuation of the AmiKet IPR&D, the carrying value of the asset would be further impaired, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to market risk and interest rate risk that may adversely impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to market risk, i.e. the risk of loss related to changes in market prices, including foreign exchange rates, of financial instruments that may adversely impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our investments may be exposed to market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect its interest income and the fair market value of investments, if any. At present, our investments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We may invest in investment-grade marketable securities with maturities of up to three years, including commercial paper, money market funds, and government/non-government debt securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income that we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur foreign currency exposures give rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the United States dollar, our functional and reporting currency, mainly against the New Israeli Shekel, (\u201cNIS\u201d), the Euro and the British pound sterling. A significant portion of our expenses are denominated in United States dollars (with certain expenses payable to Israeli personnel, including sub-contractors and consultants, in the NIS). Our United States dollar expenses consist principally of payments made to personnel in the United States, including sub-contractors and consultants for preclinical studies, clinical trials and other research and development activities. We anticipate that the bulk of our expenses will continue to be denominated in United States dollars and the NIS. If the United States dollar fluctuates significantly against the NIS, the Euro or the British pound sterling it may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nTo date, we have not engaged in hedging transactions. In the future, we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rates of our principal operating currencies. These measures, however, may not adequately protect us from the material adverse effects of such fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations resulting in a devaluation of the NIS, the Euro or the British pound sterling compared with the United States dollar could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and share price.\nWe are in default under our agreement for the acquisition of the European rights to Ceplene. If not cured, we bear significant risk to our business plan regarding Ceplene, including the loss of such rights.\nUnder an asset purchase agreement between Immune and Meda Pharma SARL (\u201cMeda\u201d), we were obligated to make a payment to Meda of $1,500,000 (the \u201cFirst Initial Consideration\u201d) no later than December 15, 2017. Under that agreement, we had a 30-day grace period to make the payment or work out a payment plan with Meda. On January 31, 2018, Meda delivered to us a default notice under the asset purchase agreement, demanding payment of the First Initial Consideration no later than February 15, 2018. We have yet to make this payment. Accordingly, Meda could terminate the asset purchase agreement, and cause the loss by us of certain Ceplene-related assets without consideration to us and cancel our further obligations under the agreement. If such action were to occur, we would need to either work out a license with Meda or renegotiate terms of a purchase of the European Ceplene rights from Meda. There can be no guarantee that that we would be able to work out such a deal. Loss of the Ceplene related assets would materially impair our ability to execute our business plan with respect to our oncology related assets and have a negative effect on our financial condition.\nRisks related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock is volatile and fluctuates substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our shareholders.\nOur stock price is often volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 developments related to our existing or any future collaboration;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs; product candidates or products;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7 other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants, and we expect to issue additional shares of common stock in the future. Conversion, exercise or sales of these securitites will dilute the interests of other security holders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were 21,002,212 shares of common stock outstanding, with up to 19,948,582 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock; 17,676,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants issued in connection with the convertible preferred stock; 1,019,677 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of other outstanding warrants; and 519,014 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. In addition, we may issue additional common stock and warrants from time to time to finance our operations, to fund potential acquisitions or in connection with additional stock options or other equity awards granted to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our 2015 Plan. The issuance of additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or warrants to purchase common stock, the perception that such issuances may occur, or exercise of outstanding warrants, convertible securities or options will have a dilutive impact on other shareholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business or us. Currently, one analyst in the U.S covers our stock. Our stock price likely would decline if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our target pre-clinical or clinical studies and operating results fail to meet the expectations.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and amended and restated bylaws (our \u201cBylaws\u201d) and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions include those establishing:\n\u00b7 a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\u00b7 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7 the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from filling vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to alter our Bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u00b7 the required approval of the holders of at least three-quarters (75%) of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our Bylaws or repeal the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u00b7 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nMoreover, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nCapital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. Currently, we intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, our certificate of designation of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock prohibits us from paying dividends on our outstanding equity securities. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe may incur substantial costs in connection with litigation and other disputes.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may, and in some cases have, become involved in lawsuits and other disputes such as securities claims, intellectual property challenges, including interferences declared by the USPTO, and employee matters - among other potential claims. Securities class action litigation often has been brought in the past against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities, among other reasons. This and other risks are especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. It is possible that we may not prevail in claims made against us in such disputes even after expending significant amounts of money and company resources in defending our positions in such lawsuits and disputes. The outcome of such lawsuits and disputes is inherently uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management has identified internal control deficiencies, which our management believes constitute material weaknesses. Any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence in our financial reporting, our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business.\nIn connection with the preparation of our audited financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we concluded that a material weakness existed in internal control over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2017, we carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control\u2009-\u2009Integrated Framework (2013), updated and reissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (2013) (\u201cCOSO Framework\u201d).\nBased on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017. In connection with the above assessment, management identified material weaknesses in the control environment relating to lack of sufficient entity level controls, segregation of duties issues due to lack of sufficient accounting and finance personnel, accounting for complex financial transactions and lack of a sufficient technology infrastructure to support the financial reporting function.\nA material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. Although we have attempted to address the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at December 31, 2017. Therefore, we cannot be certain that, in the future, additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If our efforts to address the weakness identified are not successful, or if other deficiencies occur, these weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price and investor confidence or other material effects on our business, reputation, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe proposed spin-off of our oncology business is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn April 2017, we announced plans to separate our oncology business as a separate, stand-alone company. The transaction is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including separate capitalization from third-party sources to fund Cytovia\u2019s start-up costs, expenses of the spin-off, payment of costs related to Ceplene and other relevant items. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect this proposed spin-off, including but not limited to failure to obtain the necessary capitalization, disruptions in general market conditions or potential problems, delays or difficulties in satisfying conditions and obtaining approvals and clearances or litigation or other legal proceedings that may arise as a result of the proposed spin-off. In addition, consummation of the spin-off will require clearance of a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC and final approval from our Board of Directors. Therefore, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spin-off on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, if at all.\nSignificant expenses in connection with the spin-off will be incurred, and such costs and expenses may be greater than we anticipate and capitalization of such initial costs may not be attainable in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, completion of the spin-off will require a significant amount of management time and effort which may disrupt our business or otherwise divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business operations. Any such difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe proposed spin-off may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.\nIf the spin-off is completed, there is uncertainty as to whether the anticipated operational, financial and strategic benefits of the spin-off will be achieved. There can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred. The combined value of the common stock of the two companies could be lower than anticipated for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the inability of the new spin-off company to operate and compete effectively as an independent company, and the stock price of the common stock of each of the two companies could experience periods of volatility. If we fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of the spin-off, our stock price could decline.\nIf the spin-off does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nWe intend to obtain an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution in the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion will be based and rely on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Immune and the new spin-off company, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Immune and the new spin-off company. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or the new spin-off company breach any of their respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. It is also possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, could determine that the distribution in the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. If the distribution in the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, is ultimately determined to be taxable, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Development, Approval and other Legal Compliance\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to develop and then commercialize our product candidates or will not be able to do so as soon as anticipated, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development, applications for regulatory approval, and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States and Europe. Failure to obtain approval of clinical trial applications, CTAs, in European Union countries may delay or prevent us from developing our drugs in one or more jurisdictions. Similarly, failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate (NDA, BLA, or MAA) will prevent us from commercializing our product candidate. While our executives have experience with the IND, NDA, BLA, CTA and MAA processes, we expect to rely on third parties to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing development and later marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. For example, new drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed. If any of our product candidates with such an indication receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years. If additional clinical trials are required for certain jurisdictions, these trials can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review process for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the review and approval of an application. In addition, there is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump\u2019s administration and the Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Any new laws or regulations that have the effect of imposing additional costs or regulatory burden on pharmaceutical manufacturers, or otherwise negatively affect the industry, could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates. In addition, President Trump has indicated that reducing the price of prescription drugs sold in the United States will be a priority of his administration. The implementation of any price controls or caps on prescription drugs, whether at the federal, state level or via other relevant agencies, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRegulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may reject a marketing application as deficient or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval(s) we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAlthough we have met with the FDA regarding the development of bertilimumab, it is possible that the FDA may change its requirements or require us to conduct additional preclinical studies and/or clinical trials that may delay the development and approval of this drug. Unfavorable data from our clinical trials may restrict the potential development and commercialization of bertilimumab or lead to the termination of its development.\nCeplene is approved by the EMA and registered in over 30 countries in Europe and Israel. It also has Orphan Drug Designation in both the European Union and United States for AML. The FDA however, refused to file the Ceplene NDA submission due to the lack of an Overall Survival primary endpoint in the study and the lack of an IL-2 treatment alone control arm. Based on new biologic and clinical findings that have been studied and analyzed since the last communication with the FDA, we are planning further formal discussions with the FDA regarding a path forward for registration in the United States.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nThe results from completed preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later stage trials and may not be predictive of the likelihood of regulatory approval.\nWe and our partners (as the case may be) discuss with, and obtain guidance from, regulatory authorities on clinical trial protocols. Over the course of conducting clinical trials, circumstances may change, such as standards of safety, efficacy or medical practice, which could affect regulatory authorities\u2019 perception of the adequacy of any of our clinical trial designs or the data we develop from our clinical trials. Clinical trial designs that were discussed with regulatory authorities prior to their commencement may subsequently be considered insufficient for approval at the time of application for regulatory approval. Changes in circumstances could affect our ability to conduct clinical trials as planned, including our ability to obtain current, timely and/or sufficient supplies of the products being tested. Even with successful clinical safety and efficacy data, we may be required to conduct additional, expensive trials to obtain regulatory approval. Any failure or significant delay in beginning new clinical trials or completing ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates, or in receiving regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates, may severely harm our business and delay or prevent us from being able to generate revenue and our stock price will likely decline.\nThe results of our clinical trials are uncertain, which could substantially delay or prevent us from bringing our product candidates to market.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. The commencement and completion of our clinical trials could be delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence or continue a study;\n\u00b7 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial parameters;\n\u00b7 slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u00b7 inability to demonstrate effectiveness or statistically significant results in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 uncertain dosing issues;\n\u00b7 inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u00b7 inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nWe cannot assure you that our planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time or at all, or that they will not need to be restructured prior to completion. Significant delays in clinical testing will impede our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue from product sales and could materially increase our development costs. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.\nWe rely on third parties over which we have little or no control to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe nature of clinical trials and our business strategy requires us to rely on clinical research centers and other third parties to assist us with clinical testing and certain research and development activities. As a result, our success is dependent upon the success of these third parties in performing their responsibilities. We cannot directly control the adequacy and timeliness of the resources and expertise applied to these activities by such third parties. If such contractors do not perform their activities in an adequate or timely manner, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. We may enter into agreements from time to time with additional third parties for our other product candidates whereby these third parties undertake significant responsibility for research, clinical trials or other aspects of obtaining FDA approval. As a result, we may face delays if these additional third parties do not conduct clinical studies and trials, or prepare or file regulatory related documents, in a timely or competent fashion. The conduct of the clinical studies by, and the regulatory strategies of, these additional third parties, over which we have limited or no control, may delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would delay or limit our ability to generate revenue from product sales.\nWe may not be able to successfully conduct clinical trials due to various process-related factors which could negatively impact our business plans. The successful start and completion of any of our clinical trials within time frames consistent with our business plans is dependent on regulatory authorities and various factors, which include, but are not limited to, our ability to:\n\u00b7 recruit and retain employees, consultants or contractors with the required level of expertise;\n\u00b7 recruit and retain sufficient patients needed to conduct a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 enroll and retain participants, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the relevant population, the proximity of participants to clinical sites, activities of patient advocacy groups, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials, the availability of alternative or new treatments, side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy, personal issues and ease of participation;\n\u00b7 timely and effectively contract with (under reasonable terms), manage and work with investigators, institutions, hospitals and the contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) involved in the clinical trial;\n\u00b7 negotiate contracts and other related documents with clinical trial parties and institutional review boards, such as informed consents, CRO agreements and site agreements, which can be subject to extensive negotiations that could cause significant delays in the clinical trial process, with terms possibly varying significantly among different trial sites and CROs and possibly subjecting us to various risks;\n\u00b7 ensure adherence to trial designs and protocols agreed upon and approved by regulatory authorities and applicable legal and regulatory guidelines;\n\u00b7 manage or resolve unforeseen adverse side effects during a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 conduct the clinical trials in a cost-effective manner, including managing foreign currency risk in clinical trials conducted in foreign jurisdictions and cost increases due to unforeseen or unexpected complications such as enrollment delays, or needing to outsource certain Company functions during the clinical trial; and\n\u00b7 execute clinical trial designs and protocols approved by regulatory authorities without deficiencies.\nIf we are not able to manage the clinical trial process successfully, our business plans could be delayed or be rendered unfeasible for us to execute within our planned or required time frames, or at all\nIf we receive regulatory approval, our marketed products will also be subject to ongoing FDA and/or foreign regulatory agency obligations and continued regulatory review, and if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could lose approvals to market any products, and our business would be seriously harmed.\nFollowing initial regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including review of adverse experiences and clinical results that are reported after our products become commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or vigilance required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our product candidates will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies. If a previously unknown problem or problems with a product, manufacturing or laboratory facility used by us is discovered, the FDA or foreign regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or on the manufacturing facility, including requiring us to withdraw the product from the market. Any changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often require FDA approval before the product, as modified, can be marketed. Our manufacturers and we will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market information. If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7 issue warning letters;\n\u00b7 impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7 suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u00b7 impose restrictions on operations;\n\u00b7 close the facilities of manufacturers; or\n\u00b7 seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIn addition, the policies of the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\nAny regulatory approval we receive for our product candidates will be limited to those indications and conditions for which we are able to show clinical safety and efficacy.\nAny regulatory approval that we may receive for our current or future product candidates will be limited to those diseases and indications for which such product candidates are clinically demonstrated to be safe and effective. For example, in addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication to an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for a broad range of indications for our product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our product candidates may be greatly reduced and may harm our ability to generate revenue.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by regulatory authorities, our regulatory approvals will be limited to those indications that are specifically submitted to the regulatory agency for review. These \u201coff-label\u201d uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the United States generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow regulatory rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the regulatory agency to delay its approval or refuse to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.\nOur lead product candidate, bertilimumab, is a biologic and may face an uncertain duration of market exclusivity.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (\u201cBPCIA\u201d) as part of the Health Care Reform Law, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created in the United States The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable.\u201d The FDA defines an interchangeable biosimilar as a product that, in terms of safety or diminished efficacy, presents no greater risk when switching between the biosimilar and its reference product than the risk of using the reference product alone. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or approved by the FDA until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product was approved under a BLA. The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that if bertilimumab or any of our other product candidates were to be approved as biological products under a BLA, such approved products should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the United States Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period as proposed by President Obama, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nAny collaborations that we enter into could be important to our business. If we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe intend to enter into collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies to develop our product candidates and generate funding for our research programs. Currently, we have no agreement with any commercial partner and we may never secure a commercial partner. These collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7 collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u00b7 disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7 collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u00b7 collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we would potentially lose the right to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u00b7 collaborators may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future;\n\u00b7 results of collaborators\u2019 preclinical or clinical trials could produce results that harm or impair other products using our technology;\n\u00b7 there may be conflicts between different collaborators that could negatively affect those collaborations and potentially others; and\n\u00b7 the number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to future collaborators or acquirers.\nIf any collaborations we enter into do not result in the successful development and commercialization of our products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research and development funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. All of the risks relating to our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization also apply to the activities of our collaborators and there can be no assurance that our collaborations will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination or otherwise changes its business priorities, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe may in the future determine to collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of therapeutic products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to access therapeutic payloads that would be suitable to development with our platform, have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nCurrently, we rely on third-party CROs to conduct our ongoing clinical trials and do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials of our other product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct and manage our clinical trials. These agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that would delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulatory standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (\u201cGCPs\u201d), for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Other countries\u2019 regulatory agencies also have requirements for clinical trials with which we must comply. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities that meet the FDA\u2019s current cGMP requirements for the production of any product candidates used in humans. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for the commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates once they receive marketing approval. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we may not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates on a timely basis or at all or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u00b7 failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain quality assurance;\n\u00b7 breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u00b7 failure to manufacture our product according to our specifications;\n\u00b7 failure to manufacture our product according to our schedule or at all;\n\u00b7 misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u00b7 termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for required raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates, including our lead product candidate bertilimumab. If our contract manufacturer cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturer and we may be unable to replace them on a timely basis or at all.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights will be critically important to the success of our business, and we may not be able to protect or enforce these rights in the United States or abroad.\nWe own or hold licenses to a number of issued United States patents and United States pending patent applications, as well as foreign patents and patent applications. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection both in the United States and in other countries for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. Our ability to protect our product candidates from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents. Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Even if our product candidates, as well as methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection for our product candidates or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee that any patents issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Even if patents have issued or will issue, we cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are or will be valid or enforceable or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us. The laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries offer different degrees of protection against use of the patented invention by others. If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. Our patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue that our patents are invalid, unenforceable, lack utility, or sufficient written description or enablement, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations and policies create a regulatory environment that encourages companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing a less burdensome pathway to approval.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7 Others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7 We or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7 We or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u00b7 Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing on our intellectual property rights.\n\u00b7 It is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u00b7 Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u00b7 Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\u00b7 We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u00b7 The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technologies, product candidates, and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and we have the funds to enforce our rights, if necessary.\nThe expiration of our owned or licensed patents before completing the research and development of our product candidates and receiving all required approvals in order to sell and distribute the products on a commercial scale can adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nLitigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.\nLitigation relating to the ownership and use of intellectual property is expensive, and our position as a relatively small company in an industry dominated by very large companies may cause us to be at a significant disadvantage in defending our intellectual property rights and in defending against claims that our technology infringes or misappropriates third party intellectual property rights. However, we may seek to use various post- grant administrative proceedings, including new procedures created under the America Invents Act, to invalidate potentially overly-broad third-party rights. Even if we are able to defend our position, the cost of doing so may adversely affect our ability to grow, generate revenue or become profitable. Although we have not yet experienced any patent litigation, we may in the future be subject to such litigation and may not be able to protect our intellectual property at a reasonable cost, or at all, if such litigation is initiated. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our existing or future patents. Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates and/or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid, we may:\n\u00b7 incur substantial monetary damages;\n\u00b7 encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; and/or\n\u00b7 be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including Patent Office administrative proceedings, such as inter-party reviews, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and revocations and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others.\nDespite safe harbor provisions, third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents, of which we are currently unaware, with claims to materials, formulations, methods of doing research or library screening, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be published patent applications, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy or patient selection methods, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license, limit our use, or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, limit our use, pay royalties or redesign our infringing product candidates, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete. Because we operate in a highly technical field of research and development of small molecule drugs, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe license patent rights from third-party owners. Such licenses may be subject to early termination if we fail to comply with our obligations in our licenses with third parties, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nWe are a party to licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business, and we may enter into additional licenses in the future. Under these license agreements we are obligated to pay the licensor fees, which may include annual license fees, milestone payments, royalties, a percentage of revenues associated with the licensed technology and a percentage of sublicensing revenue. In addition, under certain of such agreements, we are required to diligently pursue the development of products using the licensed technology. If we fail to comply with these obligations and fail to cure our breach within a specified period of time, the licensor may have the right to terminate the applicable license, in which event we could lose valuable rights and technology that are material to our business. If the licensor retains control of prosecution of the patents and patent applications licensed to us, we may have limited or no control over the manner in which the licensor chooses to prosecute or maintain its patents and patent applications and have limited or no right to continue to prosecute any patents or patent applications that the licensor elects to abandon. The loss of any such rights provided under our license agreements could materially harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIf we are unable to obtain licenses needed for the development of our product candidates, or if we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to patents or other intellectual property from third parties, we could lose licensing rights that are important to our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain and/or obtain licenses needed for the development of our product candidates in the future, we may have to develop alternatives to avoid infringing on the patents of others, potentially causing increased costs and delays in drug development and introduction or precluding the development, manufacture, or sale of planned products. Some of our licenses provide for limited periods of exclusivity that require minimum license fees and payments and/or may be extended only with the consent of the licensor. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to meet these minimum license fees in the future or that these third parties will grant extensions on any or all such licenses. This same restriction may be contained in licenses obtained in the future.\nAdditionally, we can provide no assurance that the patents underlying any licenses will be valid and enforceable. To the extent any products developed by us are based on licensed technology, royalty payments on the licenses will reduce our gross profit from such product sales and may render the sales of such products uneconomical. In addition, the loss of any current or future licenses or the exclusivity rights provided therein could materially harm our business financial condition and our operations.\nIf any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur success also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel and our consultants and advisors, as well as our licensors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. Unlike some of our competitors, we maintain our proprietary libraries for ourselves as we believe they have proven to be superior in obtaining strong binder product candidates. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors to enter into agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nFrom time to time we may need to license patents, intellectual property and proprietary technologies from third parties, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to successfully develop, manufacture and market our drug products. As an example, it may be necessary to use a third party\u2019s proprietary technology to reformulate one of our drug products in order to improve upon the capabilities of the drug product. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on reasonable terms, our ability to commercially exploit such drug products may be inhibited or prevented.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our technologies and product candidates, and we cannot give any assurance that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized.\nTo date, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the acquisition and development of our product candidates. We have not demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful acquisition, development or commercialization of the technologies we are seeking to develop. As an early stage company, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize such product candidates. Our product candidates are currently in preclinical development or in clinical trials. Our business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur. We currently generate no revenues from the sale of any drugs, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable drug.\nThe successful development, and any commercialization, of our technologies and any product candidates would require us to successfully perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u00b7 developing our technology platform;\n\u00b7 identifying, developing, manufacturing and commercializing product candidates;\n\u00b7 entering into successful licensing and other arrangements with product development partners;\n\u00b7 participating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u00b7 formulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u00b7 conducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations have been limited to organizing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology and identifying and obtaining early preclinical data or clinical data for various product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to continue to develop our technology, identify product candidates, develop and commercialize any product candidates we are able to identify and enter into successful collaborative arrangements with other companies, as well as for you to assess the advisability of investing in our securities. Each of these requirements will require substantial time, effort and financial resources.\nEach of our product candidates will require additional preclinical or clinical development, management of preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization, and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. In addition, our product development programs contemplate the development of companion diagnostics by our third-party collaborators. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and must themselves be cleared or approved for marketing by the FDA or certain other foreign regulatory agencies before we may commercialize our product candidates.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. It is not uncommon for companies in the biopharmaceutical industry to suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trial results may not be successful.\nProduct candidate development risk is heightened by any changes in the planned clinical trials compared to the completed clinical trials. As product candidates are developed through preclinical to early and late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing and methods of administration, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. While these types of changes are common and are intended to optimize the product candidates for late stage clinical trials, approval and commercialization, such changes do carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives.\nWe have not previously initiated or completed a corporate-sponsored clinical trial. Consequently, we may not have the necessary capabilities, including adequate staffing, to successfully manage the execution and completion of any clinical trials we initiate, in a way that leads to our obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all.\nIn the event we are able to conduct a pivotal clinical trial of a product candidate, the results of such trial may not be adequate to support marketing approval. Because our product candidates are intended for use in life- threatening diseases, in some cases we ultimately intend to seek marketing approval for each product candidate based on the results of a single pivotal clinical trial. As a result, these trials may receive enhanced scrutiny from the FDA. For any such pivotal trial, if the FDA disagrees with our choice of primary endpoint or the results for the primary endpoint are not robust or significant relative to control, are subject to confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other study endpoints, including possibly overall survival or complete response rate, the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA or an NDA based on such pivotal trial. The FDA may require additional clinical trials as a condition for approving our product candidates.\nDelays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenue.\nAlthough we are planning for certain clinical trials relating to bertilimumab, we may experience delays in our clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7 reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7 obtaining IRB, approval at each site;\n\u00b7 recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7 clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7 having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7 developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;\n\u00b7 adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7 manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials; or\n\u00b7 Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nFurthermore, we intend to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and we intend to have agreements governing their committed activities, for which we will have limited influence over their actual performance. We could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (\u201cDSMB\u201d), for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nCompetition for patients in conducting clinical trials may prevent or delay product development and strain our limited financial resources.\nMany pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials in patients with the disease indications that our potential drug products target. As a result, we must compete with them for clinical sites, physicians and the limited number of patients who fulfill the stringent requirements for participation in clinical trials. Also, due to the confidential nature of clinical trials, we do not know how many of the eligible patients may be enrolled in competing studies and who are consequently not available to us for our clinical trials. Our clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to the inability to enroll enough patients. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study. The delay or inability to meet planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delays or termination of the trial, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop products.\nThe regulatory review and approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, review and approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the companion diagnostics we contemplate developing with partners; and\n\u00b7 the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. This lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nOther than with respect to Ceplene, we have not previously submitted a BLA or an NDA to the FDA or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon our collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics to be used with our product candidates, as well as the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patients that we are targeting for our product candidates are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates both in the United States, the European Union and in additional foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in other countries, to obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. In particular, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 revised the payment methodology for many products under the Medicare program in the United States. This has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d), was enacted. The PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Further, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the requirement that individuals maintain health insurance coverage or face a penalty (known as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d). The removal of this provision, coupled with the threat of the repeal of other PPACA provisions, may increase instability of the insurance marketplace and may have consequences for the coverage and accessibility of prescription drugs. President Trump and HHS Secretary Azar have announced support for regulatory provisions that would limit the PPACA and number of healthcare reform programs initiated under the Obama administration. Such government-adopted reform measures may adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the U.S. or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payors.\nLegislative changes to or regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible under the current administration. The American Health Care Act of 2017 (\u201cAHCA\u201d), which would repeal and replace key portions of the ACA, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but ultimately was not passed by the U.S. Senate. In addition, in January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. More recently, the Senate Republicans introduced and then updated a bill to replace the ACA known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The Senate Republicans also introduced legislation to repeal the ACA without companion legislation to replace it, and a \"skinny\" version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. Each of these measures was rejected by the full Senate. In December 2017, tax reform legislation was signed into law that eliminates the individual insurance mandate provisions of the ACA. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA. We expect that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for products and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, as well as our ability to set satisfactory prices for our products, to generate revenues, and to achieve and maintain profitability.\nIn addition, President Trump has indicated that reducing the price of prescription drugs will be a priority of his administration. The implementation of any price controls or caps on prescription drugs, whether at the federal level or state level, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe effect of comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation on us, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain at this time.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, \"An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\" (informally titled the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\"). Among a number of significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") reduces the marginal U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limits the deduction for net interest expense, limits the deduction for net operating losses and eliminates net operating loss carrybacks, modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits, shifts the United States toward a more territorial tax system, and imposes new taxes to combat erosion of the U.S. federal income tax base. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the impact will be recognized in our tax expense in the year of enactment. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. However, the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on us and our affiliates, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time.\nWe may expand our business through the acquisition of companies or businesses or by entering into collaborations or in-licensing product candidates that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe may in the future seek to expand our pipeline and capabilities by acquiring one or more companies or businesses, entering into collaborations or in-licensing one or more product candidates. Acquisitions, collaborations and in-licenses involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7 potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities;\n\u00b7 substantial cash expenditures;\n\u00b7 incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition;\n\u00b7 difficulties in assimilating the operations and technology of the acquired companies;\n\u00b7 potential disputes regarding contingent consideration;\n\u00b7 the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7 diverting our management\u2019s attention away from other business concerns;\n\u00b7 entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience; and\n\u00b7 potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies or businesses.\nOur experience in making acquisitions, entering collaborations and in-licensing product candidates is limited. We cannot assure you that any acquisition, collaboration or in-license will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or in-licensed product candidate. In addition, our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions, collaborations and in-licenses. We cannot assure you that we would be able to successfully combine our business with that of acquired businesses, manage a collaboration or integrate in-licensed product candidates or that such efforts would be successful. Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or company or any collaboration or in-licensed product candidate may require a substantial capital investment by us. We may use our securities as payment for all or a portion of the purchase price or acquisitions. If we issue significant amounts of our equity securities for such acquisitions, this would result in substantial dilution of the equity interests of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nEven if any of our product candidates (other than Ceplene) receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nOther than Ceplene, which has been approved for sale in the European Union, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community, and physicians may continue to rely on these treatments. In addition, many new drugs have been recently approved and many more are in the pipeline for the same diseases for which we are developing our product candidates. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 efficacy, safety and other potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 ability to offer products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7 convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u00b7 strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7 availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 prevalence and severity of their side effects;\n\u00b7 any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications;\n\u00b7 interactions of our products with other medicines patients are taking; and\n\u00b7 inability of certain types of patients to take the product.\nIf we are unable to establish effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties with such capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization or make arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing functions.\nIn the future, we expect to build a focused specialty sales and marketing infrastructure to market or co-promote some of our product candidates in the United States and potentially elsewhere, if and when they are approved. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u00b7 our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7 the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or educate physicians on the benefits of our products;\n\u00b7 the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u00b7 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u00b7 inability to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and governmental agencies.\nOutside the United States, we expect to rely on third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates. We may not be successful in entering into arrangements with such third parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, may be lower if we rely on third parties for these functions than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our product candidates. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.\nSmaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales and marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Major competing products to our lead drug, bertilimumab, such as Remicade and Humira are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. Multiple other new drugs will be launched prior to bertilimumab in its various target indications but may limit its potential market acceptance. NanomAbs are competing with other ligand nanoparticle conjugates developed by well-funded companies such as BIND Therapeutics and Merrimack. They are also competing with other types of Bio-Conjugates including antibody drug conjugates developed by Seattle Genetics and Immunogen. Insufficient funding or inability to secure timely corporate partnerships will prevent us from successfully developing the commercial opportunity with NanomAbs.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidates (other than Ceplene), the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product-licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control, including possible price reductions, even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy period of time, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for drugs. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to generate a profit. Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved for by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue;\n\u00b7 reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $5.0 million in clinical trial liability insurance coverage in the aggregate and per incident, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth and Other Risks Related to Our Business\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management, scientific and clinical team. Although we have entered into employment letter agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. We do not carry any \u201ckey man\u201d insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any key members of senior management, our investment team, or senior marketing personnel. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nA variety of risks associated with operating internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our United States operations, we have operations in Israel through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Immune Pharmaceuticals Ltd. We face risks associated with our operations in Israel, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, legal, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We are also conducting and in the future plan to continue to conduct clinical trials of product candidates in Israel. We are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities in Israel and elsewhere, including:\n\u00b7 compliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for our products;\n\u00b7 compliance with Israeli laws with respect to our wholly owned subsidiary, Immune Ltd.;\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7 foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n\u00b7 United States and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 economic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism or political instability in particular foreign countries;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues;\n\u00b7 compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u00b7 challenges in enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations in Israel and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.", "PERMNO": 91078, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "IMNPQ"}
