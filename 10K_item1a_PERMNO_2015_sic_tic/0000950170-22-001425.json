RISK FACTORS\nTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark\u2019s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular. Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below.\nRisks Related to Trustmark\u2019s Business\nInterest Rate Risks\nTrustmark\u2019s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.\nTrustmark\u2019s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark\u2019s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of actions by the FRB. Market interest rates have declined to historical lows. During 2020, the ten-year Treasury yield fell below 1.00% for the first time, and the FRB reduced the target federal funds rate to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The FRB reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves from 1.60% to 0.10% during the first quarter of 2020. These rates continued through 2021, although the FRB has announced its intent to increase rates and wind down securities purchases commencing in March 2022. The prolonged period of low interest rates has had an adverse effect on net interest income and margins and profitability for financial institutions, including Trustmark.\nFinancial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark\u2019s balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark\u2019s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior. In addition, the model incorporates Management\u2019s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates. Trustmark\u2019s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2021, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 20.1%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may increase net interest income 9.7%. In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2021, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 6.7%.\nNet interest income is Trustmark\u2019s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark\u2019s interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below:\n\u2022In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities. The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.\n\u2022The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income. Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives. Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times. For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings. Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment. For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.\nFinancial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates. This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates. Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark\u2019s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark\u2019s balance sheet.\nTrustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments. In spite of Trustmark\u2019s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management\u2019s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results. In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.\nTrustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change. Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.\nTrustmark may be adversely affected by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after the end of 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that the publication of most LIBOR term rates will end on June 30, 2023 (excluding one-week U.S. LIBOR and two-month U.S. LIBOR, the publication of which ended on December 31, 2021). The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the reference rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. The federal banking agencies have encouraged banking organizations to cease entering into new contracts that use US$ LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate. Market participants are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. While the benchmark provider for US$ LIBOR (which was typically the benchmark that Trustmark used) intends to provide the benchmark for some tenors of US$ LIBOR through June 2023, Trustmark has transitioned to SOFR for new variable rate loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments as of January 1, 2022.\nTrustmark has a significant number of existing loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk. Since alternative reference rates are calculated differently than LIBOR, payments under contracts referencing new alternative reference rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition has changed and will continue to change, Trustmark\u2019s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be;\nhowever, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation with its customers.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nTrustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and results of operations.\nThere are inherent risks associated with Trustmark\u2019s lending activities. While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, if trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses. Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark\u2019s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark\u2019s allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management. As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required, to make further increases in its provision for credit losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.\nAdditionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions. This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information. Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTrustmark is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of Trustmark\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Trustmark may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require Trustmark to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit Trustmark\u2019s ability to use or ability to sell the affected property or to repay the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase Trustmark\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of nonresidential real estate before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeclines in asset values may result in credit losses and adversely affect the value of Trustmark\u2019s investments.\nTrustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities. The market value of investments in Trustmark\u2019s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.\nOn a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for expected credit losses. At December 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses on securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded totaled $31.0 million. Trustmark may be required to record credit loss expense if these investments suffer a decline in value that is the result of a credit loss. If Trustmark determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance would be measured using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security\u2019s purchase date. The amount of credit loss Trustmark may record is limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a credit loss, if any, occurs.\nLiquidity Risk\nTrustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.\nLiquidity refers to Trustmark\u2019s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.\nLiquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed. Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark\u2019s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark\u2019s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark\u2019s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.\nTrustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact. Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities. Management continuously monitors Trustmark\u2019s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.\nExternal and Market-Related Risks\nTrustmark\u2019s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate the spread of it have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on economic activity globally, nationally and locally, including the geographical area in which Trustmark operates and industries in which Trustmark regularly extends credit. Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term. While Trustmark\u2019s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. While domestic demand for loans has improved, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth. Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high. Management\u2019s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark\u2019s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital. Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.\nInterest rates remain within a historically low level that, when combined with the extended period of lower interest rates in recent years, continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors). Conversely, increases in interest rates will place competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds. It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark\u2019s results of operations.\nTrustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future. A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways. In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark\u2019s charge-offs and provision for credit losses.\n\u2022Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark\u2019s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022Management\u2019s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark\u2019s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective. If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark\u2019s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark\u2019s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.\n\u2022At December 31, 2021, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 1.1% of Trustmark\u2019s total LHFI portfolio and consisted principally of loans within the oilfield services and midstream segments. Additionally, at December 31, 2021, less than 1 basis point of Trustmark\u2019s energy-related LHFI were classified as nonaccrual. Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy\nreserves. Nonetheless, if oil prices fall to levels that compromise the financial condition of market participants generally, or of Trustmark\u2019s energy-related borrowers specifically, for an extended period of time, Trustmark could experience weakening or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio.\nIt is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline. If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark\u2019s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business. Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFor a further discussion of the potential risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see the risk factors under the section captioned \u201cRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d below.\nTrustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.\nTrustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources. Such competitors primarily include banks, as well as community banks operating nationwide and regionally within the various markets in which Trustmark operates. Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.\nSome of Trustmark\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark\u2019s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.\nTrustmark\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark\u2019s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark\u2019s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions. Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, Trustmark\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark. Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s results of operations.\nCompliance and Regulatory Risks\nTrustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.\nTrustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations,\npolicies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage. In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nTrustmark is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of direct or indirect negative consequences, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on geographic expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. TNB recently settled a fair lending enforcement action with the Department of Justice, the OCC and the CFPB. See the section captioned \u201cExecutive Overview\u201d included in Part II. Item 7. - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.\nIn addition, financial institutions face scrutiny on actions and policies that are deemed to adversely impact consumers under the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2019s prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts and practices. Bank regulators and the CFPB are responsible for enforcing these prohibitions against banking organizations. These prohibitions have been applied to prohibit perceived customer abuse in connection with a range of products, services, and practices, including account openings and fees charged where inadequate or no services are rendered for which charges were imposed, as well as other instances where consumers may have been misled through bank disclosures. In addition, the enforcement priorities of the agencies enforcing consumer protection laws have evolved over time and may continue to do so.\nFailure by Trustmark to perform satisfactorily on its CRA evaluations could make it more difficult for Trustmark\u2019s business to grow.\nThe performance of a bank under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of its community is a factor that must be taken into consideration when the federal banking agencies evaluate applications related to mergers and acquisitions, as well as branch opening and relocations. If TNB is unable to maintain at least a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d CRA rating, its ability to complete the acquisition of another financial institution or open a new branch will be adversely impacted. If TNB received an overall CRA rating of less than \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d the FDIC would not re-evaluate its rating until its next CRA examination, which may not occur for several more years, and it is possible that a low CRA rating would not improve in the future. As of its last examination, TNB received a CRA rating of \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d\nTrustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.\nUnder the regulatory capital rules of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III, Trustmark and TNB are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of at least 4.0%. In addition, for TNB to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the banking agencies\u2019 prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.\nThe capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital. For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company\u2019s Tier 1 capital. Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if Trustmark consummates an acquisition of a depository institution holding company and the resulting organization has $15 billion of more in total assets.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 326, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d requires Trustmark to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. FASB ASC Topic 326 generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses model could be materially impacted by changes in current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions. It is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of changes in macroeconomic conditions or the impact such changes could have on Trustmark\u2019s allowance for credit losses; however, material changes in the allowance for credit losses could have a material impact on Trustmark\u2019s reserves and capital.\nThe regulatory capital rules applicable to Trustmark and TNB may continue to evolve as a result of new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States. Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on Trustmark and TNB.\nTrustmark\u2019s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark\u2019s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nTrustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business. Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC. Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. These regulatory expectations may change, and potentially become more rigorous in certain ways, due to an interagency effort to replace existing guidance on the risk management of third-party relationships with new guidance. Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships. Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks. While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.\nOperational Risks\nThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark\u2019s business.\nTrustmark relies on statistical and quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If models for determining expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nAlso, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark\u2019s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator\u2019s perception that the quality of Trustmark\u2019s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nTrustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIf Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price would generally be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $389.3 million. Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets. Trustmark\u2019s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment. Management cannot provide\nassurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark\u2019s stock price.\nTrustmark holds other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.\nAs business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans. At December 31, 2021, Trustmark held $4.6 million of other real estate, compared to $11.7 million at December 31, 2020. The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios. Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title. As a result, Trustmark\u2019s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets. The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nIf Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.\nOne of Trustmark\u2019s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans. Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses. Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties. Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full. However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Representations and Warranties Framework, which provides that FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties if the mortgage loans satisfy certain criteria, such as payment history or quality control review.\nChanges in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Trustmark\u2019s investments in premises, equipment, technology and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.\nTrustmark has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network. Advances in technology such as ecommerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including interactive teller machines (ITMs) and other equipment, as well as an increasing customer preference for these other methods of accessing Trustmark\u2019s products and services, could decrease the value of its branch network, technology, or other retail distribution physical assets and may cause Trustmark to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of Trustmark\u2019s remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.\nTrustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.\nTrustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark\u2019s business. Trustmark\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks. Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark\u2019s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark\u2019s control. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. Further, Trustmark\u2019s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security. If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark\u2019s or its customers\u2019 confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark\u2019s or its customers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 operations. Trustmark may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark. Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.\nSecurity breaches in Trustmark\u2019s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmarkSM) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk. Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark\u2019s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark\u2019s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark\u2019s reputation and business.\nTrustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. Accordingly, Trustmark\u2019s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors\u2019 computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security. Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks. While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor\u2019s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nTrustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.\nIn order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies. Trustmark continues to invest in technology to facilitate the ability of its customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services. Trustmark\u2019s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects. Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies. Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.\nTrustmark\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nTrustmark\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTrustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.\nTrustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities. Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.\nIn recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.\nSubstantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to its reputation.\nDamage to Trustmark\u2019s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark\u2019s business.\nTrustmark\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation. Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response. Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn. Significant harm to Trustmark\u2019s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived\nunethical or illegal behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s reputation. Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients. The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s businesses.\nRisk Related to Acquisition Activity\nPotential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark\u2019s business and dilute shareholder value.\nTrustmark continuously monitors the market for merger or acquisition opportunities and, depending upon business and other considerations, may elect to pursue one or more such opportunities in the future. Any such merger or acquisition candidate would need to have a similar culture to Trustmark, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark\u2019s business, potential diversion of Trustmark\u2019s Management\u2019s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark\u2019s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate its spread and economic impact could adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19, and actions taken by governmental and public health authorities to mitigate its spread, such as instituting quarantines, travel restrictions and \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, have caused and may continue to cause severe disruptions in both domestic and international economies, which could continue to disrupt the business, activities and operations of Trustmark\u2019s customers, as well as its business and operations. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate the spread of it have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on economic activity globally, nationally and locally.\nTrustmark\u2019s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of its customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. A significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause Trustmark\u2019s customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations, particularly in the event of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Trustmark\u2019s market regions. Although Trustmark maintains contingency plans for pandemic outbreaks, a significant increase in COVID-19 case above current levels could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct its business activities. Such an increase or outbreak could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for Trustmark. If COVID-19 spreads or the response to contain COVID-19 is unsuccessful, Trustmark could experience a material adverse effect to its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of actions by the FRB that affect Trustmark. Market interest rates have declined significantly. In March of 2020, the ten-year Treasury yield fell below 1.00% for the first time, and the FRB reduced the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The FRB also reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves from 1.60% to 0.10% during March of 2020. These rates continued throughout 2021. The FRB has announced that it intends to begin raising rates and withdrawing other support measures starting in March 2022. It is not clear how the markets will react to these changes; heightened volatility resulting therefrom, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect Trustmark's net results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the federal banking agencies also issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and providing relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to such guidance and related provisions of the CARES Act, Trustmark is not treating certain COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs. For additional details regarding COVID-related loan modification, see the section captioned \u201cCOVID-19 Update - Loan Concessions\u201d included in Part II. Item 7. - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. Finally, in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the FRB established numerous emergency programs, including various liquidity facilities, intended to mitigate disruptions to certain financial markets, all of which have since expired. The absence of such emergency programs could result in further financial market disruptions, and adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s business, if economic conditions decline.\nIn addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause Trustmark to modify its business practices, including the implementation of temporary branch and office closures. Trustmark may be required to take further actions by government authorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may also take further actions that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers and business partners. Although Trustmark has initiated certain protocol and restricted business travel in its workforce, if significant portions of its workforce, including key personnel, are unable to work effectively because of illness, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on Trustmark\u2019s business could be exacerbated. Further, increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, and Trustmark\u2019s employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts in the remote environment. In addition, Trustmark\u2019s technological resources may be strained due to the number of remote users.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and its impact on the economy heightens the risk associated with many of the risk factors described in this report, such as those related to credit losses and Trustmark\u2019s reliance on its executives and third-party service providers, for example. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact Trustmark\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital, liquidity ratios and stock price, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA\u2019s PPP, Trustmark is subject to additional risks of litigation from its customers or other parties regarding TNB\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nTrustmark participated as a lender under the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several financial institutions have been subject to litigation regarding the processes and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. Trustmark may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached TNB regarding PPP loans, regarding its processes and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. In addition to litigation, Trustmark\u2019s participation in the PPP exposes Trustmark to the possibility of governmental investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity. If any such litigation, enforcement action or other action is filed against Trustmark and is not resolved in a manner favorable to Trustmark, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation and investigations can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation and investigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTrustmark also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by TNB, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by TNB, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from Trustmark.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.\nThe volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner. Trustmark\u2019s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole. The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark\u2019s stock price in particular include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in earnings;\n\u2022changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;\n\u2022perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;\n\u2022provisions in Trustmark\u2019s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser;\n\u2022changes in government regulation;\n\u2022failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and\n\u2022volatility affecting the financial markets in general.\nGeneral market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nTrustmark\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark\u2019s financial statements. The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles. In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP. Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations. For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nTrustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.\nTrustmark\u2019s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense. While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees. If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark\u2019s business.\nMany of Trustmark\u2019s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark\u2019s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses. Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark\u2019s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change and societal responses to climate change could adversely affect Trustmark\u2019s business and results of operations, including indirectly through impact to its customers.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require businesses to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns.\nIt is not possible to predict how climate change may impact Trustmark\u2019s financial condition and operations; however, Trustmark operates in areas where its business and the activities of its customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change. The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts and rising sea levels. These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change customer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for Trustmark\u2019s products and services. Trustmark and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. Trustmark and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and the like. The impact to Trustmark\u2019s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. In addition, Trustmark could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Trustmark\u2019s efforts to take these risks into account may not be effective in protecting it from the negative\nimpact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior and could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 35263, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TRMK"}
