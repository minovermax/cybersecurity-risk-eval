{"cik": "815093", "company": "MGC DIAGNOSTICS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur results are affected by changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions.\nWe derived 28.1% and 20.0% of our respective fiscal 2015 and 2014 revenues from outside the United States. Our business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond our control, such as downturns in economic activity or labor conditions in a specific country or region.\nOur ownership and operation of Medisoft entails ownership of Euro-denominated assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and Dollar-Euro currency changes have adversely affected our results.\nWe incurred foreign currency losses of $929,000 and $456,000 in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the same two years, we also incurred foreign currency translation losses of $149,000 and $114,000 that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. Our business may be adversely affected by Euro and other currency rate fluctuations against the US Dollar.\nIf we are unable to attain synergies from the acquisition of Medisoft, our sustained profitability may be uncertain.\nWe have made significant personnel and financial resource commitments for the acquisition and integration of Medisoft. Medisoft incurred losses of $999,000 and $508,000 in fiscal 2015 and 2014. If we are unable to adequately integrate Medisoft operations to generate revenue growth and operational synergies our combined profitability and financial position may continue to be adversely affected.\nAny goodwill impairment could adversely affect our net income and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment. We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Adverse developments may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount; these developments could lead to goodwill measurement and impairment. These developments may include our failure to realize anticipated synergies from our Medisoft acquisition, including significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results and lowered expectations of future financial results. At October 31, 2015, we had recorded $3.3 million of goodwill, as adjusted, from our August 1, 2014 Medisoft acquisition. If Medisoft fails to achieve the future revenue and gross margin levels that we expect, we may be forced to recognize a non-cash impairment with respect to the carrying value of our Medisoft goodwill.\nWe own significant inventory of a product for which we are pursuing, but have not received, FDA clearance.\nWe have entered into a distribution agreement under which we agreed to purchase and resell third-party products in markets that are adjacent to our core cardiorespiratory diagnostic products.\nIn 2013, we entered into an agreement with a European company to purchase forced oscillation therapy (\u201cFOT\u2019) products for resale. As of October 31, 2015, we had FOT inventory with a carrying value of $1,265,000. We are seeking FDA clearance to market and sell this product in the United States, but we cannot ensure we will receive FDA clearance in the near future or at all. Although the FOT product is authorized for sale in number of countries, including European countries, if we do not obtain FDA clearance and our sales outside the United States do not achieve a level that enable to sell this inventory, we may be required to take an impairment charge against this FOT inventory.\nWe are engaged in litigation with the manufacturer of a sleep diagnostic product.\nIn March 2014, we entered into an agreement with NeuroVirtual USA, Inc. (\u201cNeuroVirtual\u201d) under which we agreed to purchase and sell NeuroVirtual sleep diagnostics products. At October 31, 2015, we had an inventory of NeuroVirtual sleep diagnostic products with cost of $449,500 and a commitment to purchase an additional $1,471,750 of NeuroVirtual sleep diagnostic products in 2015 and 2016.\nIn a letter dated December 17, 2015, we informed NeuroVirtual that we were rescinding the distribution agreement. We rescinded the distribution agreement because it violated specific statutory requirements that are unrelated to product safety or performance. Rescission of the distribution agreement requires NeuroVirtual to repurchase our inventory. As an alternative to this repurchase, we offered to enter into a \u201cwind-down agreement\u201d under which we would have the right to sell the sleep diagnostic products inventory we have purchased.\nOn January 12, 2016, NeuroVirtual commenced a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, asserting breach of contract, anticipatory breach of contract, and fraud in the inducement. NeuroVirtual has alleged (i) damages of $1,055,120 for breach of contract, (ii) damages of $1,363,850 for anticipatory breach of contract, and (iii) damages of no less than $5.0 million for fraud in the inducement. We believe that our rescission of the distribution agreement was proper and that we have valid defenses to the NeuroVirtual claims. We intend to file an Answer and Counterclaim against NeuroVirtual. At this time, we are unable to provide an estimate of a possible loss, or a range of loss, in connection with this lawsuit.\nWe have not recognized any impairment of the sleep diagnostic product inventory because we believe that either NeuroVirtual will repurchase the inventory or that the parties will agree that we may sell this inventory. If we are unable to successfully resolve this matter, we may determine that some or all of the sleep diagnostics inventory is impaired and we would be required to record an impairment charge against this inventory.\nWe have capitalized significant cost and expenses related to new software products.\nWe capitalize costs to develop new software products because these software products are an integral part of our diagnostic medical devices. We begin to capitalize costs related to new product software once we have achieved technological feasibility and we have completed all research and development for the product\u2019s components. We amortize these software costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related product beginning when the product is available for general customer release. See \u201cIntangible Assets, Note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.\u201d\nAt October 31, 2015, we had capitalized software development costs of $2.9 million, a majority of which is related to a new operating software for our cardiorespiratory diagnostic products. During fiscal 2015, we capitalized an additional $740,000 of software development costs. During fiscal 2015, we determined that one software product was impaired and incurred a $265,000 impairment charge. If we determine that any software is impaired in the future, then we will be required to incur a charge against earnings in the amount of the impaired software.\nWe have commenced litigation against the MediSoft selling shareholders.\nIn November 2015, we commenced litigation in the French-speaking courts of Brussels, Belgium against the MediSoft selling shareholders for violations of representations and warranties in the stock purchase agreement dated as of July 10, 2014 under which we purchased MediSoft. We alleged that these violations resulted in damages to us of approximately \u20ac985,400 ($1,084,000). In May 2015, we received payment of \u20ac406,700 ($447,000) with respect to these alleged violations pursuant to a bank-guaranteed contractual escrow fund and we have reflected that payment on our books and records. The defendant selling shareholders have advised us that they intend to assert a counterclaim against us. Although we believe we have valid claims for violations of the stock purchase agreement, litigation in any foreign jurisdiction involves costs and expenses. We currently expect that this litigation process in the Belgian courts may continue until the fall of 2017.\nOur success depends on our ability to sell our Medical Graphics and Medisoft cardiorespiratory products into our core hospital, clinic and physician office markets.\nWe sell our Medical Graphics and Medisoft cardiorespiratory diagnostic products and services to hospitals, clinics and physician offices. Although we encountered stronger sales demand in fiscal 2015 than in fiscal 2014, we experienced disruptive and uncertain economic conditions in several recent years, partially due to cost-containment measures that many of our customers initiated. It is possible that a challenging environment for the sale of our products could develop in fiscal 2016.\nOur association with domestic Group Purchasing Organizations(\u201cGPOs\u201d) may result in reduced gross margins.\nPrice competition or negotiated lower prices with GPOs may exert downward pressure on prices we are able to charge for our products. We cannot ensure that we will be able to offset any downward price pressure through corresponding cost reductions. Any failure to offset this pressure could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHealthcare policy changes, including national legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales beginning in calendar 2013. This tax adversely affected our profitability. Although this tax has been suspended for two years beginning January 1, 2016, it may be imposed again in the future after the period of suspension ends.\nIf we are unable to sustain profitability in 2016 and beyond, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we were profitable in fiscal 2013 and 2015, we were unprofitable in fiscal 2008 through 2012 and in fiscal 2014 and had an accumulated deficit of $4.4 million as of October 31, 2015. While we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance of $6.6 million as of October 31, 2015 is adequate to support operations for at least the next fiscal year, we must sustain profitability. If this is not possible we may need to obtain additional financing to be able to meet our future cash flow requirements, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve either of these.\nThe financial stability of our vendors could affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on third party vendors for certain components used in our products. We purchase a number of significant components, such as capacitors, batteries and integrated circuits, from sole source suppliers. Although we attempt to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory of these components to minimize production delays or interruptions, we cannot ensure that we will find suitable alternatives at reasonable prices, if at all, or that any alternatives will remain available to us. Our inability to obtain acceptable components in a timely manner or find and maintain suitable replacement suppliers for components would have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to manufacture our products. As a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world in recent years, our vendors may have experienced and continue to experience cash flow concerns. As a result, vendors may increase their prices, reduce their output or change terms of sales. Any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nTechnology in the medical device industry changes rapidly.\nRapid technological change, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions are all characteristics of the medical device industry. We face intense competition from other device manufacturers that may have access to greater resources. Our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing products before we do. Any of these developments could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur future operations are dependent upon variables outside our control.\nSuccessful implementation of our business plan depends on the interaction of many variables, including the effects of changing industry conditions and new competition. While we believe that our business plan reflects reasonable judgments in assessing those risks, we cannot ensure that unforeseen influences will not adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan strategies. While we believe that our business plan projections are in line with achievable performance levels, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain, and sustain, projected sales revenue.\nProtection of intellectual property is critical to our business.\nPatents and trademarks are critical in the medical device industry. We believe strongly in protecting our intellectual property and have a long history of obtaining patents, when available, in connection with our research and product development programs. We own a number of United States and foreign patents. We also own registered trademarks, and have applied for other trademarks in the United States and foreign countries. We cannot ensure that we will be granted patents and trademarks in the future, or that any patents and trademarks that we now hold or may be granted, or under which we have held license rights, will be valid or otherwise be of value to us. Even if our patents and trademarks are valid, others may be able to introduce non-infringing competitive products.\nAlthough patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing agreements or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial, and we cannot ensure that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property, including know-how, in part, through confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements and assignment of invention provisions in agreements with employees, consultants and other parties, as well as through contractual exclusivity with certain suppliers. We cannot ensure that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.\nRealization of our deferred tax assets depends on our continued profitability.\nOur recent profitability and our expectation of future profitability was the basis for the partial reversal of the valuation allowance on Medical Graphics domestic deferred tax assets. The valuation of the respective deferred tax assets of Medical Graphics and Medisoft depends on the respective future profitability of each company. Our inability to achieve necessary levels of profitability could require us to record valuation reserves or impairment losses against our deferred tax assets.\nWe depend upon our senior management and other key personnel.\nOur success depends largely on effective leadership from our senior management and other key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel with sufficient and relevant experience in the medical device industry is intense. Accordingly, the loss of the services of these individuals, or the inability to hire additional key individuals as required, could have a material adverse effect on us, including our current and future product development efforts.\nOur ability to repurchase our common shares or pay cash dividends is governed by a credit agreement.\nOn July 24, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with BMO Harris Bank NA. The credit facility currently includes a five-year $4.0 term loan and a $250,000 revolving credit facility. The credit agreement includes other usual and customary covenants for facilities of this nature, and requires us to comply with the agreement\u2019s financial covenants as a condition to repurchasing our shares or paying any dividends.\nAnti-Takeover provisions in Minnesota law may make a hostile takeover of our business more difficult.\nWe are governed by the provisions of Sections 302A.671 and 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could potentially operate to deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock and may also have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock. Section 302A.671 generally provides that the shares of a corporation acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d have no voting rights unless voting rights are approved by the shareholders in a prescribed manner. A \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d is generally defined as an acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares that would, when added to all other shares beneficially owned by the acquiring person, entitle the acquiring person to have voting power of 20% or more in the election of directors. Section 302A.673 prohibits a public corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions. An \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d is a person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Reference is made to the detailed terms of Sections 302A.671 and 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. We have also entered into agreements with certain executive officers that provide for certain benefits upon a change of control. These agreements would make any sale of the Company more expensive to a third party.", "PERMNO": 89609, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "MGCD"}
