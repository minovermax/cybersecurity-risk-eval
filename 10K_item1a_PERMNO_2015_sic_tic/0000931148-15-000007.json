You should carefully read all of the information included in this report and carefully consider, among other matters, the following risk factors, as well as any discussed under Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\u201d If any of the conditions or events described in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be affected materially and adversely. In that case, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nThe risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, individually or in the aggregate, may also impair our business operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO US\nA downturn in global economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business.\nWhile the global recovery continues, the pace of recovery remains sluggish and uneven geographically. Downside risks remain, including high unemployment, reduced consumer spending, high deficit spending by governments, turbulent financial markets (particularly in the euro area), tighter monetary policies (particularly in emerging markets). In the U.S., the uncertainty regarding government shutdowns and threatened shutdowns, significant mandated tax increases, government debt ceiling limitations, sequestration and government spending cuts and budget negotiations pose a serious risk for the U.S. economy and consumer confidence. In the event that the U.S. federal government is unable to achieve a resolution of these issues there could be an adverse impact on the U.S. economy, which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings\nAs more fully described under \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we are currently facing a challenging environment for our products, particularly our Industrial Materials products, as a result of global economic conditions.\nThe International Monetary Fund reported GDP growth figures for 2014 at approximately 3.3%. We believe that in the graphite electrode markets the capacity utilization rate was approximately 69% in 2013 and 74% in 2014. These lower capacity utilization rates may continue to be driven by a challenging environment for our customers which would negatively impact demand for our Industrial Materials products and may adversely affect our results of operations for 2014.\nWe are dependent on the global steel industry and also sell products used in the transportation, semiconductor, solar, petrochemical, electronics, and other industries which are susceptible to global and regional economic downturns.\nWe sell our Industrial Materials products, which accounted for about 77% of our total net sales in 2014, primarily to the EAF steel production industry. Many of our other products are sold primarily to the electronics, transportation, alternative energy, and oil and gas exploration industries. These are global basic industries, and they are experiencing various degrees of contraction, growth and consolidation. Customers in these industries are located in every major geographic region. As a result, our customers are affected by changes in global and regional economic conditions. This, in turn, affects overall demand and prices for our products sold to these industries. As a result of changes in economic conditions, demand and pricing for our products sold to these industries has fluctuated and in some cases declined significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDemand for our products sold to these industries may be adversely affected by improvements in our products as well as in the manufacturing operations of customers, which reduce the rate of consumption or use of our products. Our customers, including major steel producers, are experiencing and may continue to experience downturns or financial distress that could adversely impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable or to collect them on a timely basis.\nSales volumes and prices of our products sold to these industries are impacted by the supply/demand balance as well as overall changes in demand, excess capacity and growth of and consolidation within, the end markets for our products. In addition to the factors mentioned above, the supply/demand balance is affected by factors such as business cycles, rationalization, and increases in capacity and productivity initiatives within our industry and the end markets for our products, and certain of such factors are affected by decisions by us. Changes in the supply/demand balance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe steel industry, in particular, has historically been highly cyclical and is affected significantly by general economic conditions. Significant customers for the steel industry include companies in the automotive, construction, appliance, machinery, equipment and transportation industries, all of which continue to be affected by the general economic downturn and the deterioration in financial markets, including severely restricted liquidity and credit availability.\nIn addition, a continuation of the current difficult economic conditions may lead current or potential customers of our Engineered Solutions business to delay or reduce technology purchases or slow their adoption of new technologies. This may result in a continued reduction, or slower rate of recovery, of sales of our Engineered Solutions products and increased price competition, which could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could limit our financial and operating activities, and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $529.9 million of total indebtedness outstanding, including approximately $40.0 million of secured indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Facility, $300.0 million of Senior Notes, and approximately $188.0 million ($200 million due at maturity in November 2015) of Senior Subordinated Notes. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $302.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving facility (after considering financial covenants restrictions and the outstanding letters of credit of approximately $5.3 million).\n. This substantial amount of indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes, including our repurchase obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional money if needed for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to an increase in interests rates, a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nmake us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nIf compliance with our debt obligations under the Revolving Facility materially limits our financial or operating activities, or hinders our ability to adapt to changing industry conditions, we may lose market share, our revenue may decline and our operating results may be negatively affected.\nThe terms of the Revolving Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes include covenants that could restrict or limit our financial and business operations.\nThe Revolving Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, restrict or limit GTI's ability and the ability of GTI's subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur, repay or refinance indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on or sell our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain fundamental corporate changes or changes to our business activities;\n\u2022\nmake investments or engage in mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nengage in certain affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements or otherwise restrict GTI's subsidiaries from making distributions or paying dividends to the borrowers under the Revolving Facility; and\n\u2022\nrepay intercompany indebtedness owed to GTI or make distributions or pay dividends to GTI.\nThe Revolving Facility also contains certain affirmative covenants and requires us to comply with financial coverage ratios regarding both our cash interest expense and our senior secured debt relative to our EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Facility).\nThese covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants in the Revolving Facility and are unable to obtain a waiver, or amendment, an event of default would result, and the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, refuse to lend additional amounts to us, require deposit of cash collateral in respect of outstanding letters of credit, or refuse to waive any restrictive covenants in the Revolving Facility, including the restriction which prohibits dividends and distributions from GTI's subsidiaries to GTI to fund payment of indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, during a default or event of default. If we were unable to repay or pay the amounts due, the lenders could, among other things, proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which includes substantially all of the assets of GTI and its U.S. subsidiaries and certain assets of certain of GTI's foreign subsidiaries.\nOur cash flows may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness, and if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, we may be required to seek other financing alternatives, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes and our obligations under the Revolving Facility, depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations, which is subject to general economic conditions, competitive pressures and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to make these payments, we may be required to seek additional financing sources, reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations or refinance our indebtedness. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to take any of these actions, and, even if successful, these actions may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance the debt under the Revolving Facility will depend on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the outstanding principal and interest on our debt could be declared to be due and payable, in which case we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation or required to substantially restructure or alter our business operations or debt obligations.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a variable rate, which subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nAll of our borrowings under the Revolving Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on this variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same.\nWe may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control repurchase.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event under the indenture governing the Senior Notes, holders of Senior Notes may require us to purchase their Senior Notes. However, it is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required purchase of Senior Notes. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the repurchase price in cash with respect to any Senior Notes tendered by holders for repurchase upon a change of control. Our failure to repurchase the Senior Notes when required would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any.\nThe terms of the Revolving Facility include covenants that could restrict or limit our ability to repurchase the Senior Notes in a change of control repurchase event.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event under the indenture governing the Senior Notes, holders of Senior Notes may require us to purchase their Senior Notes. The Revolving Facility contains a restrictive covenant on the repurchase or retirement of indebtedness, which could limit or restrict our ability to make the required repurchase of Senior Notes. If the repurchase of Senior Notes does violate covenants in the Revolving Facility and if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would occur if we repurchased the Senior Notes, and the lenders under the Revolving Facility could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts thereunder due and payable, refuse to lend additional amounts to us, and require a deposit of cash collateral in respect of outstanding letters of credit. If we were unable to repay or pay the amounts due, the lenders could, among things, proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which includes substantially all of the assets of GTI and GTI's U.S. subsidiaries and certain assets of certain of GTI's foreign subsidiaries.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nAny rating assigned to our debt could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, which may continue indefinitely or intensify, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers and suppliers.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers and suppliers. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our businesses or conduct acquisitions or make other discretionary investments, as well as our ability to effectively hedge our currency or interest rate risks and exposures. Such disruptions may also adversely impact the capital needs of our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with operations in multiple countries.\nA substantial majority of our net sales are derived from sales outside the U.S., and a majority of our operations and our total property, plant and equipment and other long- lived assets are located outside the U.S. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with operating in multiple countries, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including impacts of transactions in various currencies, impact on translation of various currencies into dollars for U.S. reporting and financial covenant compliance purposes, and impacts on results of operations due to the fact that costs of our foreign subsidiaries are primarily incurred in local currencies while their products are primarily sold in dollars and euros;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in customs duties and other tariffs;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in currency exchange controls, including imposition of or increases in limitations on conversion of various currencies into dollars, euros, or other currencies, making of intercompany loans by subsidiaries or remittance of dividends, interest or principal payments or other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in revenue, income or earnings taxes and withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in investment or trade restrictions by the U.S. or by non-U.S. governments or trade sanctions adopted by the U.S.;\n\u2022\ninability to definitively determine or satisfy legal requirements, inability to effectively enforce contract or legal rights and inability to obtain complete financial or other information under local legal, judicial, regulatory, disclosure and other systems; and\n\u2022\nnationalization or expropriation of assets, and other risks which could result from a change in government or government policy, or from other political, social or economic instability.\nWe cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on us or that we would be able to mitigate such material adverse effects in the future.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by inflation, deflation and stagflation in each country in which we have a manufacturing facility. We cannot assure you that future increases in our costs will not exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts, if any, by which we may be able to increase prices for our products.\nOur ability to grow and compete effectively depends on protecting our intellectual property. Failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect us.\nWe believe that our intellectual property, consisting primarily of patents and proprietary know-how and information, is important to our growth. Failure to protect our intellectual property may result in the loss of the exclusive right to use our technologies. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality and restricted use agreements to protect our intellectual property. Some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application or any such agreement.\nPatents are subject to complex factual and legal considerations. Accordingly, there can be uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of any particular patent. Therefore, we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\nany of the U.S. or foreign patents now or hereafter owned by us, or that third parties have licensed to us or may in the future license to us, will not be circumvented, challenged or invalidated;\n\u2022\nany of the U.S. or foreign patents that third parties have non-exclusively licensed to us, or may non-exclusively license to us in the future, will not be licensed to others; or\n\u2022\nany of the patents for which we have applied or may in the future apply will be issued at all or with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us.\nMoreover, patents, even if valid, only provide protection for a specified limited duration.\nWe cannot assure you that agreements designed to protect our proprietary know-how and information will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our strategic alliance suppliers and customers, consultants, employees or others will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our relationships with them against us.\nIn addition, effective patent, trademark and trade secret protection may be limited, unavailable or not applied for in the U.S. or in any of the foreign countries in which we operate.\nFurther, we cannot assure you that the use of our patented technology or proprietary know-how or information does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nIntellectual property protection does not protect against technological obsolescence due to developments by others or changes in customer needs.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights may be achieved, in part, by prosecuting claims against others whom we believe have misappropriated our technology or have infringed upon our intellectual property rights, as well as by defending against misappropriation or infringement claims brought by others against us. Our involvement in litigation to protect or defend our rights in these areas could result in a significant expense to us, adversely affect the development of sales of the related products, and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nIf necessary, we may seek licenses to intellectual property of others. However, we can give no assurance to you that we will be able to obtain such licenses or that the terms of any such licenses will be acceptable to us. Our failure to obtain a license from a third party for its intellectual property that is necessary for us to make or sell any of our products could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or use of processes requiring the use of such intellectual property.\nOur current and former manufacturing operations are subject to increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental requirements.\nWe use and generate hazardous substances in our manufacturing operations. In addition, both the properties on which we currently operate and those on which we have ceased operations are and have been used for industrial purposes. Further, our manufacturing operations involve risks of personal injury or death. We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to our current and former properties, neighboring properties, and our current raw materials, products, and operations. These laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and sometimes require evaluation and registration or the installation of costly pollution control or safety equipment or costly changes in operations to limit pollution or decrease the likelihood of injuries. It is also possible that the impact of such regulations on our suppliers could affect the availability and cost of our raw materials. In addition, we may become subject to potential material liabilities for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, for claims alleging personal injury or property damage resulting from exposure to or releases of hazardous substances, or for personal injury as a result of an unsafe workplace. Further, alleged noncompliance with or stricter enforcement of, or changes in interpretations of, existing laws and regulations, adoption of more stringent new laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown contamination or imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could be material.\nWe may face risks related to greenhouse gas emission limitations and climate change.\nThere is growing scientific, political and public concern that emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d) are altering the atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. Legislators, regulators and others, as well as many companies, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. GHG emissions are regulated in the European Union via an Emissions Trading Scheme (\u201cETS\u201d), otherwise known as a \u201cCap and Trade\u201d program. In the United States, environmental regulations issued in 2009 and 2010 require reporting of GHG emissions by defined industries, activities and suppliers, and regulate GHG as a pollutant covered under the New Source Review, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V Operating Permit programs of the Clean Air Act Amendments. It is possible that some form of regulation of GHG emissions will also be forthcoming in other countries in which we operate or market our products. Regulation of GHG emissions could impose additional costs, both direct and indirect, on our business, and on the businesses of our customers and suppliers, such as increased energy and insurance rates, higher taxes, new environmental compliance program expenses, including capital improvements, environmental monitoring, and the purchase of emission credits, and other administrative costs necessary to comply with current requirements and potential future requirements or limitations that may be imposed, as well as other unforeseen or unknown costs. To the extent that similar requirements and limitations are not imposed globally, such regulation may impact our ability to compete with companies located in countries that do not have such requirements or do not impose such limitations. The company may also realize a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes in prices received for products sold, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for products produced by the company. The impact of any future GHG regulatory requirements on our global business will be dependent upon the design of the regulatory schemes that are ultimately adopted and, as a result, we are unable to predict their significance to our operations at this point in time.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on the company's operations are uncertain and will likely be particular to the geographic circumstances. These physical impacts may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns,\nshortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, and changing global average temperatures. For instance, our Seadrift facility and our Calais facility, are located in geographic areas less than 50 feet above sea level. As a result, any future rising sea levels could have an adverse impact on their operations and on their suppliers. Due to these uncertainties, any future physical effects of climate change may or may not adversely affect the operations at each of our production facilities, the availability of raw materials, the transportation of our products, the overall costs of conducting our business, and our financial performance.\nWe face certain litigation and legal proceedings risks that could harm our business.\nWe are involved in various product liability, occupational, environmental, and other legal claims, demands, lawsuits and other proceedings arising out of or incidental to the conduct of our business. The results of these proceedings are difficult to predict. Moreover, many of these proceedings do not specify the relief or amount of damages sought. Therefore, as to a number of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate the possible range of liability that might be incurred should these proceedings be resolved against us. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if resolved against us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on supplies of raw materials and energy. Our results of operations could deteriorate if that supply is substantially disrupted for an extended period.\nWe purchase raw materials and energy from a variety of sources. In many cases, we purchase them under short term contracts or on the spot market, in each case at fluctuating prices. The availability and price of raw materials and energy may be subject to curtailment or change due to:\n\u2022\nlimitations which may be imposed under new legislation or regulation;\n\u2022\nsupplier's allocations to meet demand of other purchasers during periods of shortage (or, in the case of energy suppliers, extended cold weather);\n\u2022\ninterruptions or cessations in production by suppliers, and\n\u2022\nmarket and other events and conditions.\nPetroleum and coal products, including decant oil, petroleum coke and pitch, our principal raw materials, and energy, particularly natural gas, have been subject to significant price fluctuations.\nWe have in the past entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix a portion of our exposure to certain products.\nA substantial increase in raw material or energy prices which cannot be mitigated or passed on to customers or a continued interruption in supply, particularly in the supply of decant oil, petroleum coke or energy, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nSeadrift could be impacted by a reduction in the availability of low sulfur decant oil or an increase in the pricing of needle coke feedstocks.\nSeadrift uses low sulfur decant oil in the manufacture of needle coke. There is no assurance that Seadrift will always be able to obtain an adequate quantity of suitable feedstocks or that capital would be available to install equipment to allow for utilization of higher sulfur decant oil, which is more readily available in the United States, in the event that suppliers of lower sulfur decant oil were to become more limited in the future. Seadrift purchases approximately 1.5 million barrels of low sulfur decant oil annually. The prices paid by Seadrift for such feedstocks are governed by the market for heavy fuel oils, which prices can fluctuate widely for various reasons including, among other things, worldwide oil shortages and cold winter weather. Seadrift's needle coke is used in the manufacture of graphite electrodes, the price of which is subject to rigorous industry competition thus restricting Seadrift's ability to pass through raw material price increases.\nWe engage in acquisitions and may encounter unexpected difficulties identifying, pricing or integrating these businesses.\nWe have pursued growth, in part, through strategic acquisitions that are intended to complement or expand our businesses, and expect to continue to do so in the future. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability\nto identify, price, finance and complete these transactions. Success will also depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions. We may encounter unexpected difficulties in completing and integrating acquisitions with our existing operations, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipated when we first entered into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have significant goodwill on our balance sheet that is sensitive to changes in the market which could result in impairment charges.\nOur annual impairment test of goodwill was performed in the fourth quarter. The estimated fair values of our reporting units were based on discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings forecasts and assumptions. The assumptions and estimates used in these valuations incorporated the current and expected economic environment. This test resulted in a goodwill impairment charge to our needle coke reporting unit of $75.7 million in 2014. Our graphite electrode reporting unit's fair value exceeds its fair value by over 10% (see Note 4 \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\"). A further deterioration in the global economic environment or in any of the input assumptions in our calculation could adversely affect the fair value of our reporting units and result in further impairment of some or all of the goodwill on the balance sheet. See Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" for further information regarding goodwill.\nOur results of operations could deteriorate if our manufacturing operations were substantially disrupted for an extended period.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to disruption due to extreme weather conditions, floods, hurricanes and tropical storms and similar events, major industrial accidents, cybersecurity attacks, strikes and lockouts, adoption of new laws or regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in governmental enforcement policies, civil disruption, riots, terrorist attacks, war, and other events. We cannot assure you that no such events will occur. If such an event occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have non-dollar-denominated intercompany loans and have had in the past, and may in the future have, foreign currency financial instruments and interest rate swaps and caps. The related gains and losses have in the past been, and may in the future be, significant.\nAs part of our cash management, we have non-dollar denominated intercompany loans between our subsidiaries. These loans are deemed to be temporary and, as a result, remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains / losses in other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAdditionally, we have in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, interest rate swaps and caps to attempt to manage interest rate expense. We have also in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, foreign currency financial instruments to attempt to hedge global currency exposures. We may purchase or sell these financial instruments, and open and close hedges or other positions, at any time. Changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in significant gains or losses with respect thereto. These instruments are marked-to-market monthly and gains and losses thereon are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThere may be volatility in our results of operations between quarters.\nSales of our products fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to such factors as changes in economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions, scheduled plant shutdowns by customers, national vacation practices, changes in customer production schedules in response to seasonal changes in energy costs, weather conditions, strikes and work stoppages at customer plants and changes in customer order patterns including those in response to the announcement of price increases or price adjustments. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, volatility with respect to demand for and prices of our industrial material products, specifically graphite electrodes, both globally and regionally. We have also experienced volatility with respect to prices of raw materials and energy, and we expect to experience volatility in such prices in the future. Accordingly, results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.\nThe graphite and carbon industry is highly competitive. Our market share, net sales or net income could decline due to vigorous price and other competition.\nCompetition in the graphite and carbon products industry (other than, generally, with respect to new products) is based primarily on price, product differentiation and quality, delivery reliability, and customer service. Electrodes, in particular, are subject to rigorous price competition. In such a competitive market, changes in market conditions, including customer demand and technological development, could adversely affect our competitiveness, sales and/or profitability.\nCompetition with respect to new products is, and is expected to be, generally based primarily on product innovation, price, performance and cost effectiveness as well as customer service.\nCompetition could prevent implementation of price increases, require price reductions or require increased spending on research and development, marketing and sales that could adversely affect us.\nWe have significant deferred income tax assets in multiple jurisdictions, and we may not be able to realize any benefits from those assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014 we had $179.8 million of gross deferred income tax assets, of which $95.7 million required a valuation allowance. In addition, we had $74.3 million of gross deferred income tax liabilities. Our valuation allowance means that we do not believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. Until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, income tax benefits in each current period will be fully reserved.\nOur valuation allowance, which is predominantly in the U.S. tax jurisdiction, does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability. We are executing current strategies and developing future strategies, to improve sales, reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve U.S. taxable income of the appropriate character to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES\nGTI is a holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries.\nGTI is a holding company and derives substantially all of its cash flow from its subsidiaries. Since GTI's operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, its cash flow and its consequent ability to service its indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to GTI or upon the payments of funds by those subsidiaries to GTI or the repayment of intercompany indebtedness owed to GTI. GTI's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities with trade payables and other liabilities. In addition to any statutory restrictions, the payment of dividends and the making of distributions and the making of loans and advances to GTI by its subsidiaries are subject to contractual restrictions provided in the Revolving Facility. In addition, any right GTI may have to receive assets of any of its subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Senior Notes to participate in those assets) is effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors.\nThe Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities, including trade payables, of GTI's subsidiaries that are not, or do not become, guarantors of the Senior Notes.\nThe Senior Notes are not guaranteed by all of GTI's subsidiaries or any of GTI's foreign subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are therefore structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities, including trade payables, of any non-guarantor subsidiary such that, in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such subsidiary, all of such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any) would be entitled to payment in full out of such subsidiary's assets before the holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled to any payment.\nAs of December 31, 2014, GTI's subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the Senior Notes had total liabilities, including trade payables (but excluding intercompany liabilities), of approximately $153.5 million or 19% of our total liabilities, and total assets (excluding intercompany receivables) of approximately $918.0 million, or 50% of our total assets. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2014, our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the Senior Notes generated approximately $662.3 million, or 61%, of our consolidated revenues and approximately $46.4 million of our consolidated operating loss of $256.4 million.\nUnder certain circumstances, subsidiary guarantees may be released.\nThose subsidiaries that provide guarantees of the Senior Notes will be released from such guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe unconditional release or discharge of any guarantee or indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the guarantee of the Senior Notes by such subsidiary guarantor;\n\u2022\nthe sale or other disposition, including by way of merger or consolidation or the sale of its capital stock following which such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the Company; or\n\u2022\nGTI's exercise of its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as described in the indenture applicable to the Senior Notes.\nIf any such subsidiary guarantee is released, no holder of the Senior Notes will have a claim as a creditor against any such subsidiary and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, of such subsidiary will be effectively senior to the claim or any holders of the Senior Notes.\nWe may incur substantially more debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment with the Senior Notes, including secured debt, which would increase the risks described herein.\nThe agreements relating to our debt, including the Revolving Facility, limit but do not prohibit our ability to incur additional debt, and the amount of debt that we could incur could be substantial. Accordingly, we could incur significant additional debt in the future, including additional debt under the Revolving Facility. Much of this additional debt could constitute secured debt, to which the Senior Notes would be effectively subordinated to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt (the collateral securing the Revolving Facility consists of substantially all of the assets of GTI and its U.S. subsidiaries and certain assets of certain of GTI's foreign subsidiaries). At December 31, 2013, approximately $302.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving facility (after considering financial covenants restrictions and the outstanding letters of credit of approximately $5.3 million). In addition, if we form or acquire any subsidiaries in the future, those subsidiaries also could incur debt, which debt would be effectively senior to the Senior Notes if those subsidiaries are not required to guarantee the Senior Notes. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nIn addition, certain types of liabilities are not considered \u201cIndebtedness\u201d under the Revolving Facility, and the Revolving Facility does not impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by the subsidiaries, if any, that might be designated as \u201cunrestricted subsidiaries.\u201d\nAdditionally, our Senior Subordinated Notes provide that they will be subordinated to certain indebtedness incurred by us so long as, on the date we incur such debt and after giving effect thereto, our leverage ratio (as defined therein) is below 4.00 to 1.00. As a result, our Senior Subordinated Notes will not be subordinated to any indebtedness if, as a result of its incurrence, our leverage ratio exceeds 4.00 to 1.00. In addition, to the extent that we grant a security interest to secure any such indebtedness, our Senior Subordinated Notes must be equally and ratably secured with such indebtedness. After giving effect to the offering of the Senior Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom our leverage ratio was below 4.00 to 1.00. As a result, the Senior Subordinated Notes are subordinated to the Senior Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the Senior Notes provides that neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, may grant a security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes unless we or the applicable subsidiary equally and ratably secure the Senior Notes.\nThe ability of holders of Senior Notes to require us to repurchase Senior Notes as a result of a disposition of \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our assets may be uncertain.\nThe definition of change of control in the indenture governing the Senior Notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of \u201call or substantially all\u201d of our assets. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase \u201csubstantially all,\u201d there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Senior Notes to require us to repurchase its Senior Notes as a result of a sale or other disposition of less than all of our assets to another person or group may be uncertain.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Senior Notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Revolving Facility, that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Senior Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in the Revolving Facility and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including the Revolving Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. In the event of such default:\n\u2022\nthe holders of such indebtedness may be able to cause all of our available cash flow to be used to pay such indebtedness and, in any event, could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under the Revolving Facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nUpon any such bankruptcy filing, we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the Senior Notes, and the holders of the Senior Notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs or charges, or any \u201cadequate protection\u201d under Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d). Furthermore, if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced under the Bankruptcy Code, we could be subject to claims, with respect to any payments made within 90 days prior to commencement of such a case, that we were insolvent at the time any such payments were made and that all or a portion of such payments, which could include repayments of amounts due under the Senior Notes, might be deemed to constitute a preference, under the Bankruptcy Code, and that such payments should be voided by the bankruptcy court and recovered from the recipients for the benefit of the entire bankruptcy estate. Also, in the event that we were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case seeking reorganization or other relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a delay and/or substantial reduction in payment under the Senior Notes may otherwise occur. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the Revolving Facility to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under the Revolving Facility and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under the Revolving Facility, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nFederal and state statutes could allow a court to void the Senior Notes or any of our subsidiaries' guarantees of the Senior Notes under fraudulent transfer laws and require noteholders to return payments received by us or the subsidiary guarantors to us or the subsidiary guarantors or to fund for the benefit of their respective creditors or subordinate the Senior Notes or the guarantees to other claims of us or the subsidiary guarantors.\nUnder the federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the Senior Notes or any of the guarantees thereof could be voided, or claims with respect to the Senior Notes or any of the guarantees could be subordinated to all other debts of GTI or the subsidiary guarantors. In addition, a bankruptcy court could void (i.e., cancel) any payments by GTI or the subsidiary guarantors pursuant to their guarantees and require those payments to be returned to GTI or the subsidiary guarantors or to a fund for the benefit of us or their respective creditors, or subordinate the Senior Notes or the guarantees to other claims of GTI or the subsidiary guarantors. The bankruptcy court might take these actions if it found, among other things, that GTI or the applicable subsidiary guarantor:\n\u2022\nreceived less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the issuance of the Senior Notes or the incurrence of its guarantee; and\n\u2022\nwas (or was rendered) insolvent by such issuance or such incurrence;\n\u2022\nwas engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business;\n\u2022\nintended to incur, or believed that it would incur, obligations beyond its ability to pay as the obligations matured; or\n\u2022\nwas a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it and, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment was unsatisfied.\nA court would likely find that GTI or a subsidiary guarantor received less than fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Senior Notes or its guarantee to the extent that it did not receive direct or indirect substantial benefit from the issuance of the Senior Notes or the incurrence of the guarantee. A court could also void the Senior Notes or any guarantee if it found that GTI or the subsidiary guarantor issued the Senior Notes or incurred the guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any present or future creditors. Although courts in different jurisdictions measure solvency differently, in general, an entity would be deemed insolvent if the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated debts, exceeds the fair value of its assets or if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay the expected liability on its debts, including contingent and unliquidated debts, as they become due. We cannot predict what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether any of the Issuer or a subsidiary guarantor was insolvent as of the relevant date or whether, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would determine that the subsidiary guarantor was insolvent on that date, or whether a court would determine that the payments thereunder constituted fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. If the issuance of the Senior Notes or the incurrence of the guarantee is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer, it could be voided altogether, or it could be subordinated to all other debts of GTI or the subsidiary guarantor, as applicable. In such case, any payment by GTI or the applicable subsidiary guarantor pursuant to the Senior Notes or its guarantee could be required to be returned to us or the applicable subsidiary guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or their respective creditors. Moreover, in such a case a court could subordinate the Senior Notes or guarantees to other claims of us or the subsidiary guarantor. If a guarantee is voided or held unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the Senior Notes would cease to have a claim against the subsidiary guarantor based on the guarantee and would be creditors only of GTI and any subsidiary guarantor whose guarantee was not similarly voided or otherwise held unenforceable.\nEach guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without rendering the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided or subordinated under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law.\nTo the extent that outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock are exercised or other equity awards are granted under our incentive plans, the ownership interests of our other stockholders will be diluted.\nWe have issued in the past, and expect to issue in the future, stock options, restricted stock units and performance share award units to directors, executive officers and other key employees under our 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan and other benefit plans. Other holders of our common stock may experience dilution upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of our common stock, or the issuance of future equity awards, granted under these equity incentive plans. Many of these awards vest upon the occurrence of events constituting a change of control, as defined under the relevant plan documents.\nOur stock price may be volatile due to the nature of our business as well as the nature of the securities markets, which could affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation which involves substantial costs and a diversion of those companies' management's attention and resources. Many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline or fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of net sales, results of operations or cash flows from operations to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nrecording of additional restructuring, impairment or other charges or costs;\n\u2022\ndownward revisions in revenue, earnings or cash flow estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndownward revisions or announcements that indicate possible downward revisions in the ratings on debt instruments that we may have outstanding from time to time, if any;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investor perception concerning our industry or our prospects; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general capital market conditions.\nForward Looking Statements\nForward Looking Statements and Risks.
