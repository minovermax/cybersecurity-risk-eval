If any of the following actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nIf actual claims payments exceed the Company\u2019s reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon its ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the insurance and reinsurance policies that it writes. The Company establishes reserves on an undiscounted basis to cover its estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the insurance policies that it writes. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves are estimates of what the Company expects to be the ultimate cost of resolution and administration of claims under the insurance policies that it writes. These estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections, the Company\u2019s assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates and assumptions as to future trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. The Company continually refines its reserve estimates in an ongoing process as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries obtain an annual statement of opinion from an independent actuarial firm on the reasonableness of these reserves.\nEstablishing an appropriate level of reserves is an inherently uncertain process. The following factors may have a substantial impact on the Company\u2019s future actual losses and loss adjustment experience:\n\u2022\nclaim and expense payments;\n\u2022\nfrequency and severity of claims;\n\u2022\nlegislative and judicial developments; and\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions, including the effect of inflation.\nFor example, as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended exposures related to claims and coverage may emerge. Examples include claims relating to mold, asbestos and construction defects, as well as larger settlements and jury awards against professionals and corporate directors and officers. In addition, there is a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers in purported class action litigations relating to claims handling, insurance sales practices and other practices. These exposures may either extend coverage beyond the Company\u2019s underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, such developments could cause the Company\u2019s level of reserves to be inadequate.\nActual losses and loss adjustment expenses the Company incurs under insurance policies that it writes may be different from the amount of reserves it establishes, and to the extent that actual losses and loss adjustment expenses exceed the Company\u2019s expectations and the reserves reflected on its financial statements, the Company will be required to immediately reflect those changes by increasing its reserves. In addition, regulators could require that the Company increase its reserves if they determine that the reserves were understated in the past. When the Company increases reserves, pre-tax income for the period in which it does so will decrease by a corresponding amount. In addition to having an effect on reserves and pre-tax income, increasing or \"strengthening\" reserves causes a reduction in the Company\u2019s insurance companies' surplus and could cause the rating of its insurance company subsidiaries to be downgraded or placed on credit watch. Such a downgrade could, in turn, adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell insurance policies.\nCatastrophic events can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial and operational condition.\nResults of operations of property and casualty insurers are subject to man-made and natural catastrophes. The Company has experienced, and expects to experience in the future, catastrophe losses. It is possible that a catastrophic event or a series of multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition. The Company\u2019s operating results could be negatively impacted if it experiences losses from catastrophes that are in excess of the catastrophe reinsurance coverage of its Insurance Operations. The Company\u2019s Reinsurance Operations also have exposure to losses from catastrophes as a result of the reinsurance treaties that it writes. Operating results could be negatively impacted if losses and expenses related to property catastrophe events exceed premiums assumed. Catastrophes,\nthe severity of which may be impacted by continued climate change, include windstorms, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis, hail, severe winter weather, fires and may include terrorist events such as the attacks of September 11, 2001. The Company cannot predict how severe a particular catastrophe may be until after it occurs. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount and type of losses incurred, the number of insureds affected, the frequency of the events and the severity of the particular catastrophe. Most catastrophes occur in small geographic areas. However, some catastrophes may produce significant damage in large, heavily populated areas.\nThe benefits of acquiring American Reliable may not be realized which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business operations and financial results.\nThere may be difficulties in the continued integration of American Reliable business, which could result in a failure to realize the potential benefits of the acquisition. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend in part upon whether the common aspects of the business can continue to be integrated in an efficient and effective manner with Global Indemnity\u2019s existing businesses. Furthermore, the risk that the Company's or American Reliable's prospective insurance premiums, investment yield, or net earnings are less than anticipated (including as a result of unexpected events including but not limited to catastrophe events, competition, costs, charges or outlays whether as a consequence of the transaction or otherwise) could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability and results of operations.\nA failure in the Company\u2019s operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties, including security breaches or cyber-attacks, could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, its reputation, and / or cause losses which would have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business operations and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent upon the secure processing, storage, and transmission of information over computer networks using applications, systems and other technologies. The business depends on effective information security and systems to perform accounting, policy administration, claims, underwriting, actuarial and all aspects of day to day operations necessary to service the Company\u2019s customers and agents, to value the Company\u2019s investments and to timely and accurately report the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe information systems the Company relies upon must ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data, including systems maintained by the Company as well as data in and assets held through third-party service providers and systems. The Company employs various measures, systems, applications and software to address the data security. The Company reviews its existing security measures and systems on a continuing basis through internal and independent evaluations. The Company has implemented administrative and technical controls and takes protective actions in an attempt to reduce the risk of cyber incidents.\nThe Company\u2019s internal and external controls, processes, and the vendors used to protect networks, systems and applications, individually or together, may be insufficient to prevent a security incident. Employee or third party vendor errors, malicious acts, unauthorized access, computer viruses, malware, the introduction of malicious code, system failures and disruptions and or cyber-attacks can result in business interruption, compromise of data and loss of assets and that could have security consequences. Complexity of the Company\u2019s technology increases regularly and has increased the risk of a security incident involving data, network, systems and applications.\nThe Company has, from time to time, experienced security incidents, none of which had a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition. Security incidents have the potential to interrupt business, cause delays in processes and procedures directly affecting the Company, and jeopardize the Company\u2019s, insureds, claimants, agents and others confidential data resulting in data loss and loss of assets and reputational damages. If this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business operations and financial results.\nSecurity incidents could require significant resources, both internal and external, to resolve or remediate and could result in financial losses that may not be covered by insurance or not fully recoverable under any insurance. The Company may be subject to litigation and damages or regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations enacted by federal, state and foreign governments, or other regulatory bodies. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business and its results of operations might be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nA wide variety of local, state, national, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data, including laws mandating the privacy and security of personal health and financial data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. The Company\u2019s\nfailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against it, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on its operations, financial performance and business.\nEvolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the European Union, the United States, and elsewhere may limit or inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to operate or expand its business, including limiting technology alliance partners that may involve the sharing of data. Additionally, there is a risk that failures in systems designed to protect private, personal or proprietary data held by the Company will allow such data to be disclosed to or acquired or seen by others, resulting in potential regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, or penalties, remediation obligations and/or private litigation by parties whose data were improperly disclosed. There is also a risk that the Company could be found to have failed to comply with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer, or disposal of such privacy, personal or proprietary data, which could subject it to fines or other sanctions, as well as adverse reputational impact. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm the Company\u2019s reputation, inhibit adoption of its products by current and future customers, or adversely impact its ability to attract and retain workforce talent.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\nIn June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 2020. The CCPA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers with the rights to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA creates a private right of action for statutory damages for certain breaches of information. In addition, the Office of the California Attorney General will be promulgating regulations to establish procedures to facilitate these new rights. The proposed regulations were published in October 2019, and the deadline for the California Attorney General to release final regulations is July 1, 2020. As such, it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to the regulations or how the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. In addition, other states have enacted or proposed legislation that regulates the collection, use, and sale of personal information, and such regimes might not be compatible with the CCPA. The Company cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA or impending legislation on its business or operations, but it may require the Company to modify its data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. If the Company fails to protect the privacy of third-party data or implement practices and procedures deemed necessary by regulators or consumers or to comply with the CCPA or other applicable regimes, the Company may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation, and reputational harm and our business may be seriously harmed. In addition, various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. It is possible that new laws, regulations, standards, recommendations, best practices or requirements will be adopted that would affect the Company\u2019s business. To the extent that the Company is subject to new laws or recommendations or chooses to adopt new standards, recommendations, or other requirements, the Company may have greater compliance burdens. If the Company is perceived as not operating in accordance with industry best practices or any such guidelines or codes with regard to privacy, the Company\u2019s reputation may suffer, and the Company could lose relationships with customers or partners.\nA decline in rating for any of the Company\u2019s insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries could adversely affect its position in the insurance market; making it more difficult to market its insurance products and cause premiums and earnings to decrease.\nIf the rating of any of the companies in its Insurance Operations or Reinsurance Operations is reduced from its current level of \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) by A.M. Best, the Company\u2019s competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer, and it could be more difficult to market its insurance products. A downgrade could result in a significant reduction in the number of insurance contracts the Company writes and in a substantial loss of business; as such business could move to other competitors with higher ratings, thus causing premiums and earnings to decrease.\nRatings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position for insurance companies. A.M. Best has seven rating categories in the A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating Scale. The categories ranging from best to worst are Superior, Excellent, Good, Fair, Marginal, Weak, and Poor. Within each rating category, there are rating notches of plus or minus to show additional gradation of the ratings.\nA.M. Best currently assigns the companies in the Insurance Operations and Reinsurance Operations a financial strength rating of \"A\" (Excellent). The objective of A.M. Best's rating system is to provide potential policyholders an opinion of an insurer's financial strength and its ability to meet ongoing obligations, including paying claims. To determine a credit rating,\nA.M. Best performs quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes evaluating balance sheet strength, operating performance, enterprise risk management, and the business profile. These ratings are based on factors relevant to policyholders, general agencies, insurance brokers, reinsurers, and intermediaries and are not directed to the protection of investors. These ratings are not an evaluation of, nor are they directed to, investors in the Company\u2019s A ordinary shares and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Company\u2019s A ordinary shares. Publications of A.M. Best indicate that companies are assigned \"A\" (Excellent) ratings if, in A.M. Best's opinion, they have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. These ratings are subject to periodic review by, and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of A.M. Best.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that its reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all, and as a result, the Company could experience losses.\nThe Company cedes a portion of gross written premiums to third party reinsurers under reinsurance contracts. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to the Company to the extent the risk is transferred, it does not relieve the Company of its liability to its policyholders. Upon payment of claims, the Company will bill its reinsurers for their share of such claims. The reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance receivables that they owe to the Company or they may not pay such receivables on a timely basis. If the reinsurers fail to pay it or fail to pay on a timely basis, the Company\u2019s financial results would be adversely affected. Lack of reinsurer liquidity, perceived improper underwriting or claim handling by the Company, and other factors could cause a reinsurer not to pay. See \"Business - Reinsurance of Underwriting Risk\" in Item 1 of Part I of this report.\nSee Note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information surrounding the Company\u2019s reinsurance receivable balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company\u2019s investment performance may suffer as a result of adverse capital market developments or other factors, which would in turn adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its income from its invested assets. As a result, the Company\u2019s operating results depend in part on the performance of its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks, including risks relating to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. The fair value of fixed income investments can fluctuate depending on changes in interest rates and the credit quality of underlying issuers. Generally, the fair market value of these investments has an inverse relationship with changes in interest rates, while net investment income earned by the Company from future investments in fixed maturities will generally increase or decrease with changes in interest rates. Additionally, with respect to certain of its investments, the Company is subject to pre-payment or reinvestment risk.\nCredit tightening could negatively impact the Company\u2019s future investment returns and limit the ability to invest in certain classes of investments. Credit tightening may cause opportunities that are marginally attractive to not be financed, which could cause a decrease in the number of bond issuances. If marginally attractive opportunities are financed, they may be at higher interest rates, which would cause credit risk of such opportunities to increase. If new debt supply is curtailed, it could cause interest rates on securities that are deemed to be credit-worthy to decline. Funds generated by operations, sales, and maturities will need to be invested. If the Company invests during a tight credit market, investment returns could be lower than the returns the Company is currently realizing and/or it may have to invest in higher risk securities.\nWith respect to its longer-term liabilities, the Company strives to structure its investments in a manner that recognizes liquidity needs for its future liabilities. However, if the Company\u2019s liquidity needs or general and specific liability profile unexpectedly changes, it may not be successful in continuing to structure its investment portfolio in that manner. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful in correlating its investment portfolio with its expected liabilities, the Company may be forced to liquidate its investments at times and prices that are not optimal, which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of its investment portfolio. The Company refers to this risk as liquidity risk, which is when the fair value of an investment is not able to be realized due to low demand by outside parties in the marketplace.\nThe Company is also subject to credit risk due to non-payment of principal or interest. Several classes of securities that the Company holds have default risk. As interest rates rise for companies that are deemed to be less creditworthy, there is a greater risk that they will be unable to pay contractual interest or principal on their debt obligations.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. Although the Company attempts to take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, the Company may not be able to mitigate\ninterest rate sensitivity effectively. A significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Company\u2019s fixed maturities securities.\nThe Company also has an equity portfolio as well as mutual funds that invest in both equity and fixed income securities. The performance of the Company\u2019s equity portfolio and mutual funds are dependent upon a number of factors, including many of the same factors that affect the performance of its fixed income investments, although those factors sometimes have the opposite effect on the performance of the equity portfolio. Individual equity securities have unsystemic risk. The Company could experience market declines on these investments. The Company also has systemic risk, which is the risk inherent in the general market due to broad macroeconomic factors that affect all companies in the market. If the market indexes were to decline, the Company anticipates that the value of its portfolio would be negatively affected.\nThe Company has investments in limited partnerships which are not liquid. The Company does not have the contractual option to redeem its limited partnership interests but receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets. The Company does not have the ability to sell or transfer its limited partnership interests without consent from the general partner. The Company\u2019s returns could be negatively affected if the market value of the partnerships declines. If the Company needs liquidity, it might be forced to liquidate other investments at a time when prices are not optimal.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information surrounding the Company\u2019s investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nDeterioration in the debt and equity markets could result in a margin call which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe collateral backing the Company\u2019s margin borrowing facility currently consist of equity securities but could also include fixed income securities in the future. Declines in financial markets could negatively impact the value of the Company\u2019s collateral. Adverse changes in market value could result in a margin call which would require the posting of additional collateral thereby reducing liquidity. Additionally, if such a margin call is not met, the Company could be required to liquidate securities and incur realized losses or it could potentially decrease the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity.\nBorrowings under the Company\u2019s margin borrowing facility are based upon a variable rate of interest, which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $73.6 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness bore interest at a rate that varies depending upon the Fed Funds Effective rate. If Fed Funds Effective rate rises, the interest rates on outstanding debt will increase resulting in increased interest payment obligations under the Company\u2019s margin borrowing facility. This could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s cash flow and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect its financial flexibility and a failure by the Company or its co-obligor, Global Indemnity Group, LLC (formerly known as \u201cGlobal Indemnity Group, Inc.\u201d) to make periodic payments related to the Subordinated Notes could adversely affect the Company.\nIn 2015, the Company sold $100 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.75% Subordinated Notes due in 2045. In 2017, the Company sold $130 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Subordinated Notes due in 2047. In 2018, the Company\u2019s indirect subsidiary, Global Indemnity Group, LLC became a co-obligor on both notes. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial flexibility, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nrequiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to debt payments, thereby, reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes.\nFurthermore, failure to make periodic payments related to outstanding indebtedness could impact rating agencies and regulators assessment of the Company\u2019s capital position, adequacy and flexibility and therefore, the financial strength ratings of rating agencies, and regulators\u2019 assessment of the solvency of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe Company is dependent on its senior executives and the loss of any of these executives or the Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain other key personnel could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of senior management and other key employees to implement the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company believes there are a limited number of available, qualified executives in the business lines in which it competes. The success of the Company\u2019s initiatives and future performance depend, in significant part, upon the continued service of the senior management team. The future loss of any of the services of members of the Company\u2019s senior management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the further implementation of the Company\u2019s business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, the Company does not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of its employees.\nEmployee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nLosses may result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly, failure to obtain proper internal authorization, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Resultant losses could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nSince the Company depends on professional general agencies, brokers, other insurance companies and other reinsurance companies for a significant portion of its revenue, a loss of any one of them could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company markets and distributes its insurance products through a group of approximately 570 professional general agencies (net of 60 professional general agencies which write business in more than one of the Company\u2019s segments) that have specific quoting and binding authority and that in turn sell the Company\u2019s insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers. The Company also markets and distributes its reinsurance products through third-party brokers, insurance companies and reinsurance companies. A loss of all or substantially all of the business produced by any one of these general agencies, brokers, insurance companies or reinsurance companies could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, the Company may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of its underwriting commitments.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s overall strategy of risk and capacity management, it purchases reinsurance for a portion of the risk underwritten by its insurance subsidiaries. Market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance it purchases, which may affect the level of its business and profitability. The Company\u2019s third party reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. The Company may be unable to maintain its current reinsurance facilities or obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If the Company is unable to renew expiring facilities or obtain new reinsurance facilities, either the net exposure to risk would increase or, if the Company is unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures, it would have to reduce the amount of risk it underwrites.\nThe Company\u2019s financial and business results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\nHistorically, the results of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. The industry's profitability can be affected significantly by:\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\ncapital capacity;\n\u2022\nrising levels of actual costs that are not foreseen by companies at the time they price their products;\n\u2022\nvolatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\nchanges in loss reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers' liability develop; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested assets and may affect the ultimate payout of losses.\nThe demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance can also vary significantly, rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases. The property and casualty insurance industry historically is cyclical in nature. These fluctuations in demand and competition could produce underwriting results that would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company faces significant competitive pressures in its business that could cause demand for its products to fall and adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company competes with a large number of other companies in its selected lines of business. The Company competes, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and other regional companies, as well as mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, reinsurance companies, underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies. The Company\u2019s competitors include, among others: American International Group, American Modern Insurance Group, Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., Berkshire Hathaway, Everest Re Group, Ltd., Foremost Insurance Group, Great American Insurance Group, Hallmark Financial Services, Inc., HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc., IFG Companies, James River Group Holdings, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc., Markel Corporation, Nationwide Insurance, RLI Corporation, Selective Insurance Group, Inc., The Hartford, The Travelers Companies, Inc., and W.R. Berkley Corporation. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than the Company does. The Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected if it loses business to competitors offering similar products at or below the Company\u2019s prices.\nMany of the Company\u2019s general agencies pay the insurance premiums on business they have bound to the Company on a monthly basis. This accumulation of balances due to the Company exposes it to credit risk.\nInsurance premiums generally flow from the insured to their retail broker, then into a trust account controlled by the Company\u2019s professional general agencies. Several of the Company\u2019s professional general agencies are required to forward funds, net of commissions, to the Company following the end of each month. Consequently, the Company assumes a degree of credit risk on the aggregate amount of these balances that have been paid by the insured but have yet to reach the Company.\nBrokers, insurance companies and reinsurance companies typically pay premiums on reinsurance treaties written with the Company on a quarterly basis. This accumulation of balances due to the Company exposes it to credit risk.\nAssumed premiums on reinsurance treaties generally flow from the ceding companies to the Company on a quarterly basis. In some instances, the reinsurance treaties allow for funds to be withheld for longer periods as specified in the treaties. Consequently, the Company assumes a degree of credit risk on the aggregate amount of these balances that have been collected by the reinsured but have yet to reach the Company.\nBecause the Company provides its general agencies with specific quoting and binding authority, if any of them fail to comply with pre-established guidelines, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company markets and distributes its insurance products through professional general agencies that have limited quoting and binding authority and that in turn sell the Company\u2019s insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers. These professional general agencies can bind certain risks without the Company\u2019s initial approval. If any of these wholesale professional general agencies fail to comply with the Company\u2019s underwriting guidelines and the terms of their appointment, the Company could be bound on a particular risk or number of risks that were not anticipated when it developed the insurance products or estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses. Such actions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s holding company structure and regulatory constraints limit its ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet its cash requirements.\nGlobal Indemnity is a holding company and, as such, has no substantial operations of its own. The Company\u2019s assets primarily consist of cash and ownership of the shares of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Dividends and other permitted distributions from insurance subsidiaries, which include payment for equity awards granted by Global Indemnity to\nemployees of such subsidiaries, are expected to be Global Indemnity's sole source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including debt service payments and other expenses.\nDue to its corporate structure, most of the dividends that Global Indemnity receives from its subsidiaries must pass through Global Indemnity Reinsurance. The inability of Global Indemnity Reinsurance to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable Global Indemnity to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on its operations.\nBermuda law does not permit payment of dividends or distributions of contributed surplus by a company if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company, after the payment is made, would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or the realizable value of the company's assets would be less, as a result of the payment, than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Furthermore, pursuant to the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978, an insurance company is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend during the financial year if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause it to fail to meet such margin or ratio. See \"Regulation - Bermuda Insurance Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of this report.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which are indirect subsidiaries of Global Indemnity Reinsurance, are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends, which must first pass through Global Indemnity Reinsurance before being paid to Global Indemnity. See \"Regulation - U.S. Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this report. Also, see Note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for the maximum amount of dividends that could be paid by the Company\u2019s U.S. insurance subsidiaries in 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may limit the way it operates.\nThe Company is subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the U.S. states in which the Insurance Operations operate. This is particularly true in those states in which the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are licensed, as opposed to those states where its insurance subsidiaries write business on a surplus lines basis. The supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. The primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of the Company\u2019s insurance policyholders and not its investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory, and administrative authority to state insurance departments. This system of regulation covers, among other things:\n\u2022\nstandards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the types of terms that the Company can include or exclude in the insurance policies it offers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the way rates are developed and the premiums the Company may charge;\n\u2022\nstandards for the manner in which general agencies may be appointed or terminated;\n\u2022\ncredit for reinsurance;\n\u2022\ncertain required methods of accounting;\n\u2022\nreserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and\n\u2022\npotential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain insurance policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.\nThe statutes or the state insurance department regulations may affect the cost or demand for the Company\u2019s products and may impede the Company from obtaining rate increases or taking other actions it might wish to take to increase profitability. Further, the Company may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and its business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, regulatory authorities have discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals subject to the applicable state statutes and appeal process. If the Company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals (including in some states the requisite secretary of state registration) or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could stop or temporarily suspend the Company from carrying on some or all of its activities or monetarily penalize the Company.\nThe U.S. insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies. Moreover, the NAIC, which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all 50 U.S. States and the District of Columbia, and state insurance regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nAlthough the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, there have been proposals from time to time to impose federal regulation on the insurance industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Federal Insurance Office initially has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers, including conducting a study for submission to the U.S. Congress on how to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the U.S. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by a two-thirds vote of a Financial Stability Oversight Council as \"systemically important.\" While the Company does not believe that it is \"systemically important,\" as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, it is possible that the Financial Stability Oversight Council may conclude that it is. If the Company were designated as \"systemically important,\" the Federal Reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding the Company\u2019s capital, liquidity, leverage, business and investment conduct. As a result of the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act, or other additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on the Company, including impacting the ways in which it conducts business, increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to smaller insurers who may not be subject to the same level of regulation.\nThe interests of holders of A ordinary shares may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s controlling shareholder.\nU.N. Co-Investment Fund III (Cayman), L.P. and Fox Paine Capital Fund II International L.P. (collectively, the \u201cFox Paine Funds\u201d), which are investment funds managed by Fox Paine & Company, LLC, beneficially own approximately 80.3% of the Company\u2019s total voting power. Fox Mercury Investments, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the \u201cFM Entities\u201d) separately beneficially own approximately 2.1% of the Company\u2019s total voting power. The percentage of the Company\u2019s total voting power that the Fox Paine Funds may exercise is greater than the percentage of the Company\u2019s total shares that the Fox Paine Funds beneficially own because the Fox Paine Funds beneficially own all of the Company\u2019s B ordinary shares, which have ten votes per share as opposed to A ordinary shares, which have one vote per share. The A ordinary shares and the B ordinary shares generally vote together as a single class on matters presented to the Company\u2019s shareholders. Based on the ownership structure of the Fox Paine Funds and affiliates that own these shares, which entities are entitled to vote the shares, these affiliated entities are not subject to the voting restriction contained in the Company\u2019s articles of association. As a result, the Fox Paine Funds have and will continue to have control over the outcome of certain matters requiring shareholder approval, including the power to, among other things:\n\u2022\nelect all of the Company\u2019s directors;\n\u2022\namend the Company\u2019s articles of association (as long as their voting power is greater than 66%);\n\u2022\nratify the appointment of the Company\u2019s auditors;\n\u2022\nincrease the Company\u2019s share capital; and\n\u2022\nresolve to pay dividends or distributions;\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Fox Paine Funds may also be able to prevent or cause a change of control. The Fox Paine Funds\u2019 control over the Company, and the Fox Paine Funds\u2019 ability in certain circumstances to prevent or cause a change of control, may delay or prevent a change of control, or cause a change of control to occur at a time when it is not favored by other shareholders. As a result, the trading price of the Company\u2019s A ordinary shares could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Company has agreed to pay Fox Paine & Company, LLC an annual management fee of $1.9 million, adjusted annually to reflect change in the consumer price index published by the US Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics \u201cCPI-U\u201d, in exchange for management services. The Company has also agreed to pay a termination fee of cash in an amount to be agreed upon, plus reimbursement of expenses, upon the termination of Fox Paine & Company, LLC\u2019s management services in connection with the consummation of a change of control transaction that does not involve Fox Paine & Company, LLC and its affiliates. The Company has also agreed to pay Fox Paine & Company, LLC a transaction advisory fee of cash in an amount to be agreed upon, plus reimbursement of expenses upon the consummation of a change of control\ntransaction that does not involve Fox Paine & Company, LLC and its affiliates in exchange for advisory services to be provided by Fox Paine & Company, LLC in connection therewith. The Fox Paine Funds, FM Entities and Fox Paine & Company, LLC (collectively, \u201cFox Paine Entities\u201d) may in the future make significant investments in other insurance or reinsurance companies. Some of these companies may compete with the Company or its subsidiaries. The Fox Paine Entities are not obligated to advise the Company of any investment or business opportunities of which they are aware, and they are not prohibited or restricted from competing with the Company or its subsidiaries.\nThe Company\u2019s controlling shareholder has the contractual right to nominate a certain number of the members of the Board of Directors and also otherwise controls the election of Directors due to its ownership.\nWhile the Fox Paine Funds have the right under the terms of the memorandum and articles of association to appoint a certain number of directors of the Board of Directors, dependent on the Fox Paine Entities\u2019 percentage beneficial ownership of voting shares in the Company for so long as the Fox Paine Entities beneficially own shares representing an aggregate 25% or more of the voting power in the Company, it also controls the election of all directors to the Board of Directors due to its controlling share ownership. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors currently consists of eight directors, all of whom were identified and proposed for consideration for the Board of Directors by the Fox Paine Funds.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors, in turn, and subject to its fiduciary duties under Cayman Island law, appoints the members of the Company\u2019s senior management, who also have fiduciary duties to the Company. As a result, the Fox Paine Funds effectively have the ability to control the appointment of the members of the Company\u2019s senior management and to prevent any changes in senior management that other shareholders or other members of the Board of Directors may deem advisable.\nBecause the Company relies on certain services provided by Fox Paine & Company, LLC, the loss of such services could adversely affect its business.\nFox Paine & Company, LLC provides certain management services to the Company. To the extent that Fox Paine & Company, LLC is unable or unwilling to provide similar services in the future, and the Company is unable to perform those services itself or is unable to secure replacement services, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nU.S., global economic, and financial industry downturns could harm the Company\u2019s business, its liquidity and financial condition, and its stock price.\nIn past years, global market and economic conditions were severely disrupted. New disruptions may potentially affect (among other aspects of the Company\u2019s business) the demand for and claims made under the Company\u2019s products, the ability of customers, counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with the Company, its ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources, the availability of reinsurance protection, the risks the Company assumes under reinsurance programs, and the Company\u2019s investment performance. Volatility in the U.S. and other securities markets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the Company\u2019s financial reports and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected.\nGlobal Indemnity is required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that the Company evaluate and determine the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting and requires that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting be attested to by its independent registered public accounting firm.\nGlobal Indemnity may discover material weaknesses in the future which may lead to its financial statements being materially misstated. As a result, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected, and the Company could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which its securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. The cost of remediating a potential material weakness could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nThe Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The Reinsurance Operations conducts business with some customers in foreign currencies and several of the Company\u2019s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries maintain cash accounts in foreign\ncurrencies. At period-end, the Company re-measures non-U.S. currency financial assets to their current U.S. dollar equivalent. The resulting gain or loss on foreign denominated cash accounts is reflected in income during the period. Financial liabilities, if any, are generally adjusted within the reserving process. However, for known losses on claims to be paid in foreign currencies, the Company re-measures the liabilities to their current U.S. dollar equivalent each period end with the resulting gain or loss reflected in income during the period. Foreign exchange risk is reviewed as part of the Company\u2019s risk management process. The Company may experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of non-U.S. currencies relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and some of its assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.\nThe Company is organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands and some of its assets are located outside the United States. A judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the United States based on civil liability would not be automatically enforceable in the Cayman Islands. There is no treaty between the Cayman Islands, or the United Kingdom (of which the Cayman Islands is an Overseas Territory) and the United States providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where the Company has assets.\nThe laws in the Cayman Islands differ from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. It may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the U.S. or to enforce judgments obtained against the Company in U.S. courts. The Company has irrevocably agreed that it may be served with process with respect to actions based on offers and sales of securities made in the U.S. by having Global Indemnity Group, LLC be the Company\u2019s U.S. agent appointed for that purpose. A Cayman court may impose civil liability on the Company or its directors or officers in a suit brought in the Cayman courts against the Company or such persons with respect to a violation of U.S. federal securities laws, provided that the facts surrounding such violation would constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Cayman law.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nLegislative and regulatory action by the U.S. Congress could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof. Legislative action may be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could, among other things, override tax treaties upon which the Company relies or could broaden the circumstances under which the Company would be considered a U.S. resident, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and cash tax position.\nRecent changes in U.S. tax law may increase taxes of the Company\u2019s U.S. Subsidiaries.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted a budget reconciliation act amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the TCJA. The TCJA contains provisions that can materially affect the tax treatment of the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, imposes a 10 percent base erosion minimum tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) on income of a U.S. corporation determined without regard to certain otherwise deductible payments made to certain foreign affiliates (including interest payments as well as gross premium or other consideration paid or accrued to a related foreign reinsurance company for reinsurance), and limits the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation.\nIt is possible that the TCJA may reduce the benefits of lower effective tax rates enjoyed as a non-U.S. company, add expense and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nInterest paid by the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries to their foreign affiliates is subject to multiple tax-related risks including risks that the interest may become subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax under BEAT, subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, subject to foreign income tax, and be non-deductible in whole or in part for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe TCJA has created new rules that limit the deductibility of interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which may cause some or all of the deduction for interest paid by the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries to be denied for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent interest paid to a foreign affiliate is deductible by the Company\u2019s U.S. Subsidiaries, such U.S. subsidiaries may become subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax charge under BEAT. Should interest paid by the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries to their foreign affiliates become ineligible under an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction of tax residence, such interest could become subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax. Finally, interest paid by the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries to their foreign affiliates may become subject to income tax in the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction of tax residence, without regard to whether there is any corresponding tax deduction in the United States, potentially subjecting such interest payments to double taxation.\nGlobal Indemnity or Global Indemnity Reinsurance may be subject to U.S. tax that may have a material adverse effect on Global Indemnity\u2019s or Global Indemnity Reinsurance\u2019s results of operations.\nGlobal Indemnity is a Cayman Island company and Global Indemnity Reinsurance is a Bermuda company. The Company seeks to manage its business in a manner designed to reduce the risk that Global Indemnity and Global Indemnity Reinsurance will be treated as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, the Company cannot be certain that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will not contend successfully that Global Indemnity or Global Indemnity Reinsurance is or has been engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If Global Indemnity or Global Indemnity Reinsurance were considered to be engaged in a business in the United States, the Company could be subject to U.S. corporate income and branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, in which case its results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nU.S. persons who hold shares in the Company may be subject to U.S. income taxation at ordinary income rates on certain income of the Company and the Company\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nIf a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d), each \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d of such corporation who owns shares in the corporation directly, or indirectly through non-U.S. entities, on the last day in such year on which such corporation is a CFC must include in its gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the CFC\u2019s \u201csubpart F income,\u201d even if the subpart F income is not distributed. A \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d for this purpose is a U.S. person that owns, or is treated as owning, at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation or 10 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such foreign corporation. In addition, each United States shareholder of any controlled foreign corporation is required to include in gross income such shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for such taxable year, which is generally equal to the excess of its pro rata share of each CFC\u2019s non-subpart F income for the taxable year over a deemed return on the tangible assets of such CFC. Moreover, any gain realized on a sale of common shares by a United States shareholder may also be taxed as a dividend to the extent of the Company\u2019s and its non-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and profits attributed to such shares during the period that the shareholder held the shares and while the Company was a CFC (with certain adjustments).\nGenerally, a foreign corporation is considered a CFC if United States shareholders own (directly, indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules) more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of such foreign corporation, or the total value of all stock of such corporation. For purposes of taking into account insurance income, however, a CFC also generally includes a foreign corporation of which more than 25% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock (or more than 25% of the total value of the stock) is owned (directly, indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules) by United States shareholders, on any day during the taxable year of such corporation.\n\u201cSubpart F income\u201d generally includes passive investment income and certain insurance income earned by CFCs. The Company anticipates that, while the income earned from its U.S. insurance and investment operations through Global Indemnity's U.S. subsidiaries would not be subpart F income, substantially all of the income earned by Global Indemnity's non-U.S. subsidiaries and by Global Indemnity itself (if any) from their non-U.S. insurance and investment activities would be subpart F income to the extent it or its non-U.S. subsidiaries were to be treated as CFCs for any taxable year.\nRelated Person Insurance Income: If the related person insurance income (\u201cRPII\u201d) of any of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries were to equal or exceed 20% of that subsidiary\u2019s gross insurance income in any taxable year, and U.S. persons were treated as owning 25% or more of the subsidiary\u2019s stock, by vote or value, a U.S. person who directly or\nindirectly owns any common shares on the last day of such taxable year on which the 25% threshold is met would be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes that person\u2019s ratable share of that subsidiary\u2019s RPII for the taxable year. The amount to be included in income is determined as if the RPII were distributed proportionately to U.S. shareholders on that date, regardless of whether that income is distributed. The amount of RPII to be included in income is limited by such shareholder\u2019s share of the subsidiary\u2019s current-year earnings and profits, and possibly reduced by the shareholder\u2019s share of prior year deficits in earnings and profits. The amount of RPII earned by a subsidiary will depend on several factors, including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by that subsidiary. Although the Company does not believe that the 20% threshold will be met for its non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, some of the factors that might affect that determination in any period may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. Consequently, the Company cannot assure that it will not exceed the RPII threshold in any taxable year.\nIf a U.S. person disposes of shares in a non-U.S. insurance corporation that had RPII (even if the 20% threshold was not met) and the 25% threshold is met at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of disposition, and the U.S. person owned any shares at such time, any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holder\u2019s share of the corporation\u2019s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned the shares (possibly whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to RPII). In addition, the shareholder will be required to comply with specified reporting requirements, regardless of the amount of shares owned. The Company believes that those rules should not apply to a disposition of common shares because the Company is not itself directly engaged in the insurance business. The Company cannot assure, however, that the IRS will not successfully assert that those rules apply to a disposition of its shares.\nU.S. persons who hold shares in the Company could be subject to adverse tax consequences if the Company is considered a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf the Company is considered a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. person who owns shares in the Company could be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and an interest charge on certain taxes that are deferred as a result of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. status. The Company does not believe that it was a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending on December 31, 2019 because the Company believes that it should be considered to be engaged in the active conduct of a global insurance and reinsurance business through its insurance subsidiaries. The Company cannot provide assurance, however, that the Company will not be deemed to be a PFIC by the IRS.\nFurther, TCJA limited the exception applicable to foreign corporations engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business by requiring that, for the exception from passive income for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business to apply to such foreign corporation, the applicable insurance liabilities of such foreign corporation must exceed 25 percent of its total assets (or 10 percent in certain limited cases if certain other applicable facts and circumstances are satisfied). Although guidance regarding the active conduct of an insurance business rules has recently been proposed by the IRS, a number of uncertainties remain, including uncertainties in the calculation of applicable insurance liabilities. Further, there can be no assurance that the proposed guidance will be finalized in their current form or that additional, adverse guidance will not be adopted by the IRS. Accordingly, due to ambiguities in the application of the relevant provisions of the TCJA and the PFIC provisions in general, as well as uncertainties about the PFIC guidance recently proposed by the IRS, there can be no assurance with respect to the Company\u2019s status as a PFIC for the current or any future taxable years of the Company.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) are considering measures that might encourage countries to change their tax laws which could have a negative impact on the Company.\nThe OECD has published an action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) impacting its member countries and other jurisdictions. It is possible that jurisdictions in which the Company does business could react to the BEPS initiative or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect the Company or its shareholders. In addition, the EU issued its Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive in 2016 and 2017 requiring the adoption by EU Member States of rules relating to, among other things, interest limitation rules, anti-hybrid rules, CFC rules and exit taxes. Some of these came in to force on January 1, 2019 and others have yet to come in to force in various Member States. Likewise, the OECD Multilateral Convention is in the process of implementing tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS, better known as the \u2018multilateral instrument\u2019 (MLI) which has been signed by over 80 jurisdictions and will effectively modify bilateral tax treaties between countries having ratified the MLI. It introduces a general anti-abuse provision with the principal purpose test being is a minimum standard and the possibility to apply other specific measures when both countries have opted for them. The implementation of these measures could have a negative impact on the Company.\nA number of multilateral organizations, including the EU and the OECD have, in recent years, expressed concern about some countries not participating in adequate tax information exchange arrangements and have threatened those that do not agree to cooperate with punitive sanctions by member countries. It is as yet unclear what all of these sanctions might be, which countries might adopt them, and when or if they might be imposed. The Company cannot assure, however, that the Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) that have been or will be entered into by the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries are located will be sufficient to preclude all of the sanctions described above, which, if ultimately adopted, could adversely affect the Company or its shareholders.\nThe Company may become subject to taxes in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries which have been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as exempted companies and, as such, obtained an undertaking from the Governor in Council of the Cayman Islands substantially that, for a period of 20 years from the date of such undertaking, which is February 9, 2016, no law that is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profit or income or gains or appreciation shall apply to the Company and no such tax and no tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable, either directly or by way of withholding, on the Company\u2019s ordinary shares. This undertaking would not, however, prevent the imposition of taxes on any person ordinarily resident in the Cayman Islands or any company in respect of its ownership of real property or leasehold interests in the Cayman Islands. Given the limited duration of the undertaking, the Company cannot be certain that it will not be subject to Cayman Islands tax after the expiration of the 20-year period.\nGlobal Indemnity Reinsurance was formed in 2006 through the amalgamation of Wind River Barbados and Wind River Bermuda. The Company received an assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Bermuda Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, as amended, that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to Global Indemnity Reinsurance or any of its operations, shares, debentures or other obligations through March 31, 2035. Given the limited duration of the assurance, the Company cannot be certain that it will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 31, 2035.\nFollowing the expiration of the periods described above, the Company may become subject to taxes in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, which may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe impact of the Letters of Commitment by the Cayman Islands and Bermuda or other concessions to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect the tax status of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is commonly referred to as the OECD, has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. The Cayman Islands and Bermuda are not listed as uncooperative tax haven jurisdictions because each had previously committed itself to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency, exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity. The Company is not able to predict what changes will arise from the OECD in the future or whether such changes will subject it to additional taxes.", "PERMNO": 89942, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "GBLI"}
