Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained herein as well as the information included in this Annual Report and other reports and filings made with the SEC in evaluating our business and prospects. Risks and uncertainties, in addition to those we describe below, that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\n\u2022 Our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment.\n\u2022 Our operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we face risks that could impact our business.\n\u2022Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u2022We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, although currently remediated, could recur and affect the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and have other adverse consequences.\n\u2022 We are dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues.\n\u2022 Many of our target customers are large commercial vehicle OEM customers and large volume customers, and the failure to obtain such customers, loss of sales to such customers or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations could have an adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022 Under certain circumstances, our customers can cancel or terminate our contracts.\n\u2022 If any of our battery products fails to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our current products or future technology could be harmed.\n\u2022 We operate in an extremely competitive industry and are subject to pricing pressures. Further, many other battery manufacturers have significantly greater resources than we have.\n\u2022 Entering into strategic alliances and relying on third-party manufacturing, including from suppliers of components we include in our finished products, exposes us to risks.\n\u2022 BorgWarner continues to have certain rights to our intellectual property following our acquisition of BorgWarner\u2019s interest in BorgWarner JV including rights that may give BorgWarner a broad commercial license to certain of our intellectual property in the event of Romeo\u2019s insolvency or breach of any debt covenant.\n\u2022 BorgWarner\u2019s acquisition of one of our competitors means that a competitor may have access, even if in violation of the Borg Warner\u2019s responsibilities under the BorgWarner JV Agreement, to Romeo\u2019s confidential information that existed as of the date that Legacy Romeo acquired BorgWarner\u2019s interest in the BorgWarner JV.\n\u2022 We are dependent on our suppliers to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders, and if we fail to manage our relationships effectively with, or lose the services of, these suppliers and we cannot substitute suitable alternative suppliers, our operations would be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022 Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of any of our battery components, such as battery cells, electronic and mechanical parts, or raw materials used in the production of such parts, could harm our business.\n\u2022 Our failure to keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards may cause our products to become obsolete and less marketable, resulting in loss of market share to our competitors or a decrease in demand for our battery packs and modules due to substitute products.\n\u2022 If we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner and at favorable margins, we may not be able to compete effectively.\n\u2022 Developments in alternative technology may adversely affect the demand for our battery modules, packs, and BMS for EVs.\n\u2022 Manufacturing or use of our products may cause accidents, which could result in significant production interruption, delay or claims for substantial damages.\n\u2022 We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\n\u2022 As components of EVs, our products as installed in the products of our customers are subject to motor vehicle standards, and the failure of the vehicles to satisfy such mandated safety standards could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products, our business and our operating results.\n\u2022 Future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business, future prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022 Third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or infringement or misappropriation of other proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate our patents may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022 We are currently dependent on a single manufacturing facility. If our facility becomes inoperable, we will be unable to produce our battery products and our business will be harmed.\n\u2022 Our efforts to increase the scale and capacity of our manufacturing processes and systems, including the transfer of our operations from our current location in Vernon, California to a new location in Cypress, California, could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022 We may be unable to successfully expand our operations or manage our growth effectively.\n\u2022 Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety rules that can bring scrutiny from regulatory agencies and increase our costs.\n\u2022 Our battery packs and BMS rely on software and hardware that are highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022 We rely on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022 The price of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d), may be volatile.\n\u2022 Ownership of our Common Stock is concentrated, and as a result, certain stockholders may exercise significant influence over us.\n\u2022We expect to issue and/or sell additional Common Stock, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our Common Stock and will result in dilution of ownership percentages.\n\u2022If we cannot maintain adequate financial liquidity to operate the business as a going concern, the value of our Common Stock will be adversely affected, possibly to a material degree.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022 Failure to fully implement and maintain adequate financial, information technology and management processes and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies, which could lead to errors in our financial reporting and adversely affect our business.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment.\nYou must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early-stage company with a limited operating history. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results will be materially and adversely harmed. Legacy Romeo was incorporated in June 2014 and has a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We derive, and intend to continue to derive, the majority of our revenues from the sale of our battery packs, modules, and BMS software and services. As of December 31, 2021, we had a backlog of approximately $392.2 million, as adjusted for a change in how battery cells are procured for a major customer. For $306.0 million out of the $392.2 million of backlog related to minimum quantity purchase commitments, if the customers do not follow through on their minimum purchase commitments, we would receive a maximum of $286.5 million under certain make-whole provisions included in these contracts. For the remaining $86.2 million of backlog related to minimum quantity purchase commitments included in these contracts, if the customers do not follow through on their minimum purchase commitments, we would be entitled to seek damages through customary remedies for breach of contract. We define contracted revenue (or \u201cbacklog\u201d) as revenue expected to be received under our existing customer contracts from sales of battery packs, modules, BMS software and services not yet built and delivered or provided. The difference between our backlog and our minimum revenue that would be received in satisfaction of take or pay minimum order commitments reflects that our backlog does not represent a guarantee that our customers will complete purchases of our products and services in the quantities that we anticipate, and some of our contracts allow our customers to purchase in smaller quantities with certain minimum order penalties. Although we have attempted to de-risk such backlog through minimum value commitments in existing contracts, there are no assurances that we will be able to maintain our current customers or supplier relationships, or secure future business with customers, such as major commercial vehicle OEMs, trucking companies and other fleet owners.\nIt is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial condition could be materially affected.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we face risks that could impact our business.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) declared a global emergency on January 30, 2020 with respect to the outbreak, and several countries have initiated travel restrictions, closed borders and given social distancing directives, including instructions requiring \u201cshelter-in-place.\u201d These measures by government authorities may remain in place for a significant period of time and they are likely to continue to adversely affect the ability of our employees to visit and qualify new production suppliers, may make it such that we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials and component parts on a timely basis or at a cost-effective price or may significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain. Our global business could be adversely affected by risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as COVID-19. We rely on our production facilities, as well as third-party suppliers, in the United States, Europe and Asia, which have been significantly impacted by COVID-19. This outbreak has resulted in the extended shutdown of certain businesses in many of these countries, which may result in disruptions or delays to our supply chain and significant disruptions to our customer base. Any disruption in these businesses will likely impact our sales and operating results. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer and business behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy and led to reduced economic activity. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nWe implemented precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely and implementing social distancing protocol for all work conducted onsite. We continue to limit non-essential travel worldwide for our employees. Business disruptions elsewhere in the world could also negatively affect the sources and availability of components and materials that are essential to the operation of our business in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In 2021, COVID-19 had an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, and it has resulted in our sustaining higher costs on raw materials than we had previously expected. However, many regions, particularly the Southern California region where our operations are principally located, have from time to time experienced increases in COVID-19 cases and governmental authorities have responded by implementing temporary closures, lockdowns and restrictions to combat COVID-19. These increases in COVID-19 cases and restrictions may have negative impacts on our operations, including our product development timelines, supply chains and distribution systems in 2022 and beyond. In addition, our efforts to qualify new suppliers, particularly in Asia, have been postponed indefinitely, which delay has required us to continue using higher cost components for our products. Because of travel restrictions, we are not able to visit many prospective customers in person, which could delay the sales conversion cycle. Due to these precautionary measures and resulting global economic impacts, we may experience significant and unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products.\nDespite progress in vaccination efforts, global economic activity remains uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Further, in the first half of 2021, a new Delta variant of COVID-19 began to spread globally and caused an increase in COVID-19 cases in many places in the United States, and in November 2021, a new Omicron variant, which appears to be the most transmissible variant to date, was detected, which Omicron variant has since caused an increase in COVID-19 cases in multiple countries, including the United States, and of which the potential severity is currently being evaluated. Public health officials and medical professionals have warned that COVID-19 cases may continue to spike due to the Delta variant and/or the Omicron variant, particularly if vaccination rates do not quickly increase or if additional, potent disease variants emerge. It is unclear how long the resurgence due to Delta or the resurgence due to Omicron will last, how severe the Delta resurgence or Omicron resurgence will be, and what safety measures governments will impose in response to the Delta resurgence or Omicron resurgence. The impact of the Delta variant and the Omicron variant cannot be predicted at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including vaccination rates among the population, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta variant and the Omicron variant and the response by governmental bodies and regulators. The outbreak has and may continue to affect the Company\u2019s operations and those of third parties on which the Company relies. The degree and duration of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our business, our operations, and the global economy as a whole, are unknown at this time. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nOur management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nBased on their assessment, our management has raised concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale and issuance of debt or equity securities or through bank financing. We believe that we will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future; however, any future financing could be dilutive to our current stockholders. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional financing. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available, we would be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized, and we may not be able to continue operations.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, although currently remediated, could recur and affect the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and have other adverse consequences.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Nevertheless, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nAs previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses related to (i) inadequate segregation of duties, including review and approval of journal entries; and (ii) lack of sufficient technical accounting resources. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company undertook remediation measures related to the previously disclosed material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. We completed the execution of the various remediation measures in the quarter ended December 31, 2021, including testing of the design and concluding on the operating effectiveness of the related controls. We believe that the previously disclosed material weaknesses have been remediated. However, completion of remediation procedures for these material weaknesses does not provide assurance that our modified controls will continue to operate properly and as a result, that our financial statements will be free from material error.\nEven though currently remediated, previously existing material weaknesses could recur, or other material weaknesses could arise, and result in material misstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis or result in delayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to additional litigation, investigations or inquiries by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nOur business and future growth depends on the growth in demand for EVs, hybrid vehicles and alternative fuel.\nAs the demand for our products is directly related to the market demand for EVs, a fast-growing e-mobility market will be critical to the success of our business. However, the markets we have currently targeted, primarily today in North America, may not achieve the level of growth we expect during the time frame projected. If the markets for our products fail to achieve our expected level of growth, we may have excess production capacity and may not be able to generate enough revenue to obtain profitability and positive cash flow. If the market for alternative fuel, hybrid vehicles and EVs does not develop at the rate or in the manner or to the extent that we expect, or if critical assumptions that we have made regarding the efficiency of our energy solutions are incorrect or incomplete, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nOur future depends on the needs and success of our customers, as well as the demand for our customers\u2019 products or services.\nThe demand for our battery products will ultimately depend on our end-market users. Decisions to purchase our battery packs, modules, and BMS may depend on the performance of the industries of our customers and if demand for output in those industries decreases, then the demand for our products may decrease as well. Demand in these industries is impacted by numerous factors, including, but not limited to, commodity prices, infrastructure spending, consumer spending, customer fleet ICE replacement schedules, travel restrictions, fuel costs, energy demands, municipal spending and government mandates and\nincentives. Increases or decreases in these variables may significantly impact the demand for our products. If we are unable to predict demand accurately, we may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 needs, resulting in the loss of potential sales, or we may produce excess products, resulting in increased inventories and overcapacity in our production facilities, increasing our unit production cost and decreasing our operating margins and cash flow.\nFurther, our customers\u2019 inability to market and sell their products or services successfully, whether from lack of market acceptance or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects because such customers may not order new or additional products from us. If we cannot achieve the expected level of sales, we will not be able to make sufficient profits to offset the expenditures we have incurred to expand our production capacity and otherwise support our business, nor will we be able to grow our business. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and future success would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are currently dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe are currently dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, BorgWarner JV engineering services revenue accounted for 35% of our total revenue, and Nikola and Hexagon Purus AS accounted for approximately 28% and 27% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, BorgWarner JV engineering services revenue accounted for 12% of our total revenue, and Nikola and Lighting Systems accounted for approximately 62% and 12% of our total revenue, respectively. Dependence on a few customers could make it difficult to negotiate attractive prices for our products and could expose us to the risk of substantial losses if a single dominant customer stops purchasing our products or if we lose a single dominant customer due to reasons out of our control. Although we anticipate greater customer diversification over time, we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to contribute a significant portion of our sales in the near future. Our ability to maintain close relationships with these top customers is essential to the growth and profitability of our business. If we fail to sell our products to one or more of these top customers in any particular period, or if a large customer purchases fewer of our products, defers orders or fails to place additional orders with us, or if we fail to develop additional major customers, our revenue could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our BorgWarner JV engineering services revenues no longer will occur as a result of our purchase of Borg Warner\u2019s ownership interest in the BorgWarner JV.\nOur customers may fail to fulfill their purchase commitments.\nOur order backlog currently consists of commitments by a small number of customers to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars of our products over the next several years. Our customers operate in a relatively new industry of commercial vehicles powered by electric batteries and have based their commitments to us on assumptions that sales in their industry will experience considerable growth over the next several years and that they will capture a significant portion of those sales. Further, those customers do not yet have a track record of profitability and may need to rely partially on invested capital to fulfill their commitments to us, and the products of those customers have not yet demonstrated broad market acceptance. If the market for commercial vehicles powered by electric batteries does not grow as expected, if some of our major customers fail to obtain necessary financial backing, or if their products are not widely accepted by the market, those customers may fail to satisfy their minimum purchase commitments to us. In that event, our revenue and profitability could be adversely effected.\nMany of our target customers are large commercial vehicle OEM customers and large volume customers, and the failure to obtain such customers, loss of sales to such customers or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAlthough we intend to sell predominantly to commercial vehicle OEMs and other large volume customers, we may not be able to establish or continue our relationships with such OEMs or large volume customers if customer demand is not as high as we expect or if commercial vehicle OEMs face pressure or contractual obligations from their existing suppliers not to purchase our products. We may enter into long-term contracts with certain of these commercial vehicle OEMs and other large volume customers who have substantial bargaining power with respect to price and other commercial terms, and any long-term contracts would be subject to renegotiation and renewal from time to time. Failure to obtain new customers, maintain existing customers, loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to any future or current customers for whatever reason (including, but not limited to, loss of contracts or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations, loss of market share by these customers, insolvency of such customers, reduced or delayed customer requirements, plant shutdowns, strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by such customers) or continued reduction of prices to these customers could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain large volume customers, maintain our current large volume customers, not lose all or a portion of sales to any future\nlarge volume customers, or offset any reduction of prices to these customers with reductions in our costs or by obtaining new contracts.\nThe level of any future sales to commercial vehicle OEMs, including the realization of future sales from awarded business or obtaining new business or customers, is inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that these commercial vehicle OEMs actually manufacture and sell. Further, to the extent that the financial condition, including bankruptcy or market share, of any of our largest customers deteriorates or their sales otherwise continue to decline, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Accordingly, we may not in fact realize all of the future sales represented by our awarded business. Any failure to realize these sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to engage target customers successfully and to convert such contacts into meaningful orders in the future.\nOur success, and our ability to increase revenue and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to identify target customers and convert such contacts into meaningful orders or expand on current customer relationships. In some cases, our battery products have been delivered to certain customers on an early trial deployment basis, where such customers have the ability to evaluate whether our products meet their performance requirements before such customers commit to meaningful orders.\nIn addition to new customers, our future success depends on whether our current customers are willing to continue using our battery products as well as whether their product lines continue to incorporate our products. As our customers expand their product lines, we hope to be the primary supplier for their fleets. Our products are fully customizable and our R&D efforts strive to create products that are on the cutting edge of technology, but competition in our industry is high. To secure acceptance of our products, we must constantly develop and introduce longer-range and more cost-effective batteries with enhanced functionality and performance to meet evolving industry standards. If we are unable to meet our customers\u2019 performance requirements or industry specifications, retain target customers, or convert early trial deployments into meaningful orders, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nUnder certain circumstances, our customers can cancel or terminate our contracts.\nWe have ongoing arrangements with our customers and target customers. Some of these arrangements are evidenced by non-binding letters of intent and memoranda of understanding, early-stage agreements that are used for design and development purposes but will require renegotiation at later stages of development or production or master agreements that have yet to be implemented under separately negotiated statements of work, each of which could be terminated or may not materialize into next-stage contracts or long-term contract partnership arrangements. For instance, we have entered into non-binding letters of intent or memoranda of understanding with certain commercial vehicle companies in the United States and Canada. Even when a binding supply agreement is in place, our customers may have the right to cancel or terminate those agreements in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet our obligations or otherwise breach such agreements. We have been late in meeting some of our customer delivery dates, and at least one of our customers has referenced (but not exercised) their contractual right to terminate our contract for failure to deliver products on a timely basis. We have disputed this customer\u2019s allegations and continue to deliver products under the agreement. If these arrangements are terminated or if we are unable to enter into next-stage contracts or long-term operational contracts, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among customers and analysts and within our industry or are subject to negative publicity, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and access to capital may suffer materially.\nCustomers may be less likely to purchase our battery products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue in the long term. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, ratings agencies and other parties in our products, long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors including those that are largely outside of our control, such as our limited operating history, customer unfamiliarity with our battery products, any delays in scaling production, delivery and service operations to meet demand, competition, future changes in the evolving hybrid electric and EV market or uncertainty regarding our production and sales performance compared with market expectations.\nIf any of our battery products fails to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our current products or future technology could be harmed.\nOur products, such as our battery modules, packs and BMS, could contain defects in design and production that may cause them not to perform as expected or to require repair. We currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the performance of our products upon which our business prospects depend. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our battery products. We may experience recalls in the future, which could adversely affect our brand and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, our products may not perform consistent with customers\u2019 expectations or consistent with other vehicles that may become available. Any product defects or any other failure of our battery modules, packs and software to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, negative publicity, product liability claims and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, problems and defects experienced by other alternative fuel commercial vehicle companies or electric consumer vehicles could, by association, have a negative impact on public perception and customer demand for our products.\nWe operate in an extremely competitive industry and are subject to pricing pressures. Further, many other battery manufacturers have significantly greater resources than we have.\nWe compete with a number of major international manufacturers and distributors, as well as a number of smaller, regional competitors. We expect competition to become more intense as our end-markets transition to zero-emission transportation. Increased competition may result in declines in average selling prices of our products, causing a decrease in margins. Due to excess capacity in some sectors of our industry and consolidation among industrial battery purchasers, we may be subjected to significant pricing pressures. Some of our customers have or may pursue a sourcing strategy in which they source battery products from more than one supplier, and our market share with these customers may decline if we unable to deliver products that are technically or economically competitive on a timely basis.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, personnel, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we do, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, certain of our competitors may have a lower overall cost structure. As a result, these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and evolving industry standards. Many of our competitors are developing a variety of battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries and fuel cells, which are expected to compete with our existing product lines. It is possible that our competitors will be able to introduce new products with more desirable features than ours and their new products will gain greater market acceptance. If our competitors successfully do so, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position, and our business and future success would be materially and adversely affected.\nRecent and potential future consolidation of companies within our industry may also increase competition and create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\nWe anticipate continued competitive pricing pressure as foreign producers are able to employ labor at significantly lower costs than producers in the U.S. and Western Europe, expand their export capacity and increase their marketing presence in our major end markets. Several of our competitors have strong technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources, as well as significant name recognition, established positions in the market and long-standing relationships with our industry\u2019s potential customer base. In addition, certain of our competitors may have long-standing relationships with suppliers, which may provide them with a competitive pricing advantage and reduce their exposure to volatile raw material costs. Our ability to maintain and improve our operating margins has depended, and continues to depend, on our ability to control and reduce our costs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to control our operating expenses, to raise or maintain our prices or increase our unit volume, in order to maintain or improve our operating results.\nEntering into strategic alliances and relying on third-party manufacturing, including from suppliers of components we include in our finished products, exposes us to risks.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into additional, strategic alliances, including joint ventures or minority equity investments with various third parties to further our business. While offering potential benefits, these strategic alliances could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the\npartners and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. For example, in May 2019, Legacy Romeo collaborated with a subsidiary of BorgWarner to form the BorgWarner JV, but BorgWarner subsequently acquired a competitor of Romeo, which ultimately was a significant factor leading to the dissolution of the BorgWarner JV. As a result, Romeo\u2019s proprietary information may now be in the possession of a competitor, and our relationships with certain customers, suppliers and vendors may be impaired by the loss of our association with BorgWarner.\nWe may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties, including competitive activities. To the extent any of these strategic third parties suffers negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with any such third-party. We could experience delays if our partners do not meet agreed upon timelines or experience capacity constraints, and in turn, we could lose customers and face reputational harm.\nFurther, there is risk of potential disputes with partners, and we could be affected by adverse publicity related to our partners whether or not such publicity is related to their collaboration with us. Our ability to successfully build a premium brand could also be adversely affected by perceptions about the quality of our partners\u2019 products. In addition, because we rely on our partners and third parties to meet our quality standards, there can be no assurance that we will successfully maintain quality standards. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may be restricted from growing sales of battery packs for stationary applications.\nUnder the JV Agreement that Legacy Romeo entered into with BorgWarner, BorgWarner will have a right of first refusal to manufacture our stationary products if, within three years of the date that we purchased BorgWarner\u2019s interest in the BorgWarner JV, we propose to expand our stationary application business, including by selling stationary applications outside of North America or expanding our manufacture of stationary applications to an extent that causes our annual production capacity to exceed the projected 6.8 gigawatt hour capacity of our existing manufacturing facility. If BorgWarner were to exercise its right to manufacture Legacy Romeo\u2019s stationary battery products, BorgWarner would be required to do so via a joint venture with Legacy Romeo on terms that Legacy Romeo and BorgWarner would negotiate at the time of forming such venture.\nLegacy Romeo was obligated to disclose to BorgWarner all of its technology that existed as of the date that Romeo purchased BorgWarner\u2019s interest in the BorgWarner JV and may not be able to (i) effectively monitor whether BorgWarner is using such technology in accordance with applicable restrictions (i.e., for non-commercial purposes only) or (ii) obtain adequate compensation for any infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in such technology.\nLegacy Romeo was obligated to provide the BorgWarner JV and BorgWarner access to all of its proprietary technology, including the source code for our BMS that existed as of the date that Romeo purchased BorgWarner\u2019s interest in the BorgWarner JV. Although the IP License states that BorgWarner must return or destroy all of that confidential information upon notice from Romeo, BorgWarner has thus far refused Romeo\u2019s demands to do so to our satisfaction. It may be possible for BorgWarner to use that technology and related intellectual property without our knowledge or in ways that the IP License does not permit, such as the development of competing products. If this happened, we might have limited monetary remedies available to us given contractual limitations of liability.\nBorgWarner could obtain a broad commercial license to Legacy Romeo\u2019s intellectual property that existed as of the date that Romeo acquired BorgWarner\u2019s interest in the BorgWarner JV in the event of Legacy Romeo\u2019s insolvency or breach of any debt covenant.\nUnder the IP License, BorgWarner has a nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use all of Legacy Romeo\u2019s intellectual property that exists as of the date that Romeo purchased BorgWarner\u2019s interest in the BorgWarner JV. That license is currently limited to noncommercial uses. However, if Legacy Romeo becomes insolvent, forms an intent to evaluate potential insolvency proceedings, or breaches any debt covenant that results in an event of default under any debt instrument, then BorgWarner would have the option, to the extent that it is valid and enforceable under applicable law, to convert its license from a noncommercial, nonexclusive license to a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, exclusive, transferrable and sub-licensable license to commercialize any products.\nAlthough we believe and would argue, if necessary, that BorgWarner\u2019s exclusive license described above would not restrict or limit Legacy Romeo\u2019s rights to sublicense or otherwise exploit its intellectual property, BorgWarner could argue that, if such\nexclusive license were triggered, the effect would be to preclude Romeo from exercising some or all of its rights under its intellectual property.\nThe Legacy Romeo intellectual property is arguably pledged to BorgWarner to secure Legacy Romeo\u2019s performance of all of its obligations to BorgWarner relating to the BorgWarner JV that survive the dissolution and termination of the IP License.\nLegacy Romeo has granted a security interest to BorgWarner in Legacy Romeo\u2019s intellectual property, to secure its obligations under all of the agreements relating to the formation or operation of the BorgWarner JV. Although the BorgWarner JV has been dissolved and the IP License has been terminated, BorgWarner may take the position that those security interests remain in place to secure performance of the obligations that survive that dissolution and termination, such as BorgWarner\u2019s right of first refusal described above to manufacture stationary applications, Legacy Romeo\u2019s obligations of confidentiality, and certain obligations relating to the maintenance of our intellectual property. Accordingly, those security interests, if they remain in effect, may impair our ability to raise debt or equity capital.\nBorgWarner\u2019s acquisition of one of our competitors means that a competitor may have access to Romeo\u2019s confidential information that existed as of the date that Legacy Romeo acquired BorgWarner\u2019s interest in the BorgWarner JV.\nOn June 4, 2021, BorgWarner acquired control of AKASOL AG, a competitor of ours, which ultimately led to the dissolution of the BorgWarner JV. As a result, our confidential information that had been disclosed to BorgWarner before the dissolution of the BorgWarner JV may now be in the possession of a competitor. Although provisions of the IP License that survive its termination state that BorgWarner is obligated to return or destroy all of that confidential information to Legacy Romeo, BorgWarner has thus far refused Romeo\u2019s demands to do so to our satisfaction. Any misuse of our confidential information could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results and we may not be able to obtain an appropriate remedy due to contractual limitations of liability.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders, and if we fail to manage our relationships effectively with, or lose the services of, these suppliers and we cannot substitute suitable alternative suppliers, our operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of many of the key components and materials used in our battery modules and packs, such as battery cells, electrical components, electromechanical components, mechanical components and enclosure materials. The inability of our suppliers to deliver necessary components of our battery products at prices and volumes, performance and specifications acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. While we plan to obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, some of the components used in our vehicles may be purchased by us from a single source. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term (or at all) at prices or quality levels that are favorable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur third-party suppliers may not be able to meet their product specifications and performance characteristics or our desired specifications, performance and pricing, which would impact our ability to achieve our product specifications and performance characteristics as well. Additionally, our suppliers may be unable to obtain required certifications for their products for which we plan to use or provide warranties that are necessary for our solutions. If we are unable to obtain components and materials used in our battery products from our suppliers or if our suppliers decide to create or supply a competing product, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of any of our battery components, such as cells, electronic and mechanical parts, or raw materials used in the production of such parts could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of our components. For example, a global shortage of battery cells is currently being reported, and the full impact to us is yet unknown. Other examples of shortages and component supply disruptions could include the supply of electronic components and raw materials (such as resins and raw metal materials) that go into the production of our components. Any such cost increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The prices for our components fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for battery cells. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 supply shortages caused by the inability or unwillingness of our suppliers and their competitors to build or operate cell production facilities to supply the numbers of cells required to support the rapid growth of the commercial EV industry as demand for such cells increases;\n\u2022 disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by the cell manufacturers;\n\u2022 a decrease in the number of manufacturers of cells; and\n\u2022 an increase in the cost of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our products, and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Samsung and LG Energy Solution for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers, though we are actively engaged in activities to qualify additional suppliers for use in EV applications.\nAny disruption in the supply of battery cells could temporarily disrupt production of our products until a different supplier is fully qualified. Moreover, cell manufacturers may refuse to supply EV manufacturers if they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe.\nThe cost of battery cells depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of EVs and energy storage products. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges. Any reduced availability of these raw materials or substantial increases in the prices for such materials may increase the cost of our components and consequently, the cost of our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of our components by increasing prices, which in turn could damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur failure to keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards may cause our products to become obsolete and less marketable, resulting in loss of market share to our competitors or a decrease in demand for our battery packs and modules due to substitute products.\nThe lithium-based battery market is characterized by changing technologies and evolving industry standards, which are difficult to predict. This, coupled with frequent introduction of new products and models, has shortened product life cycles and may render our products obsolete or unmarketable. Our ability to adapt to evolving industry standards and anticipate future standards and market trends will be a significant factor in maintaining and improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. To achieve this goal, we have invested and plan to continue investing significant financial resources in our R&D infrastructure. R&D activities, however, are inherently uncertain, and we might encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results. Accordingly, our significant investment in our R&D infrastructure may not bear fruit. On the other hand, our competitors may improve their technologies or even achieve technological breakthroughs that would render our products obsolete or less marketable. Therefore, our failure to effectively keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards by introducing new and enhanced products may cause us to lose our market share and to suffer a decrease in our revenue.\nWe may experience significant delays in the design, production and launch of our new products, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur R&D team is continually looking to improve our battery packs and modules. Next generation module and third generation BMS are in concept development and prototyping phase, and are not expected to be productionized before 2024 and may occur later or not at all. Any delay in the financing, design, production and launch of our new products could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. There are often delays in the design, production and commercial release of new products, and to the extent we delay the launch of the items identified above, our growth prospects could be adversely affected as we may fail to grow our market share, to keep up with competing products or to satisfy customers\u2019 demands or needs. We rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of many of the key components and materials used in our battery products, and to the extent they experience any delays, we may need to seek alternative suppliers. If we experience delays by our third-party suppliers, we could experience delays in delivering on our timelines.\nIf we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner and at favorable margins, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe battery industry has been notable for the pace of innovations in product life, product design and applied technology. We and our competitors have made and continue to make, investments in R&D with the goal of further innovation. Our ability to create new products and product line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can, among other things:\n\u2022 develop and fund research and technological innovations;\n\u2022 receive and maintain necessary intellectual property protections;\n\u2022 obtain governmental approvals and registrations;\n\u2022 comply with governmental regulations; and\n\u2022 anticipate customer needs and preferences successfully.\nThe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could also compromise our competitive position. If competitors introduce new or enhanced products that significantly outperform ours, or if they develop or apply manufacturing technology that permits them to manufacture at a significantly lower cost relative to ours, we may be unable to compete successfully in the market segments affected by these changes.\nDevelopments in alternative technology may adversely affect the demand for our battery modules, packs, and BMS for EVs.\nSignificant developments in alternative technologies, such as fuel cell technology, advanced diesel, ethanol or natural gas, or solid state batteries, may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results in ways that we may not currently anticipate. Existing and other battery technologies, fuels or sources of energy may emerge as customers\u2019 preferred alternatives to our battery products. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced alternative products, which could result in decreased revenue and a loss of market share to our competitors.\nOur R&D efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in alternative fuel and EV technology. As technologies evolve, we plan to upgrade or adapt our energy solutions with the latest technology, in particular lighter weight modules and packs, advanced cooling methods, and advanced battery chemistry, which may also negatively impact the adoption of our other products. However, we may not compete effectively with alternative systems if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our battery products.\nLithium-ion battery cells have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.\nOur battery packs and modules make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While our battery packs and modules are single cell fault tolerant and, therefore, designed to contain any single cell\u2019s release of\nenergy without spreading to neighboring cells, a field or testing failure of our battery packs could occur. This faulty result could subject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive or vehicle applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells, such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve vehicles containing our battery packs, could seriously harm our business and reputation.\nIn addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facility. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, a safety issue or fire related to the cells could disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor\u2019s EV or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products. Such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nManufacturing or use of our products may cause accidents, which could result in significant production interruption, delay or claims for substantial damages.\nDue to the high energy density inherent in lithium-based batteries, our batteries can pose certain safety risks, including the risk of fire. Our battery modules and packs are single cell fault tolerant, meaning if for some reason a certain battery exhibits a thermal incident, the thermal incident will not propagate to the neighboring cells. Our state-of-the-art testing systems verify all critical specifications to assure everything is fully functional as intended. Nevertheless, accidents causing death or personal injury or property damage, can occur. Although we incorporate safety procedures in the research, development, manufacture and transportation of batteries that are designed to minimize safety risks, the manufacture or use of our products may still cause accidents. Any accident, whether occurring at the manufacturing facilities or from the use of our products, may result in significant production interruption, delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damage.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\nProduct liability claims, even those without merit or those that do not involve our products, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims, and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event that our battery products do not perform or are claimed not to have performed as expected. As is true for other commercial vehicle suppliers, we expect in the future that our battery products will be installed on vehicles that will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury. Additionally, product liability claims that affect our competitors may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products.\nA successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. While we maintain product liability insurance, we may not be able to cover any substantial monetary judgment against us. Moreover, a product liability claim against us or our competitors could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAs components of EVs, our products as installed in the products of our customers are subject to motor vehicle standards, and the failure of the vehicles to satisfy such mandated safety standards could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products, our business and our operating results.\nOur products are used as components in EVs. All vehicles sold must comply with applicable international, federal, and state motor vehicle safety standards, which vary by national and other jurisdictions. In the United States, vehicles that meet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are certified under the federal regulations. Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. Failure by our vehicle manufacturing customers to satisfy motor vehicle standards could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMoreover, we may incur our own significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the EV industry and alternative energy industry are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations.\nTo the extent the laws become more stringent or otherwise change, our components or the vehicles into which they are incorporated may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent\ncompliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws of which we are unaware in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex and difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our or our customer\u2019s ability to sell products could have a negative and material impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture product recalls could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny product recall in the future, whether it involves our or a competitor\u2019s product, may result in negative publicity, damage our brand and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our products are proven to, or possibly could, be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThird-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or infringement or misappropriation of other proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate our patents may adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in part on our avoiding infringement, misappropriation and other violations of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Claims of infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of patents or other intellectual property rights are often expensive and time-consuming to defend, and if we were unsuccessful in defending such claims we could be forced to stop use of certain technologies and/or pay damages or on-going royalties. It is very difficult to determine whether products and technologies infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nSome of our competitors may have more resources than we do to pursue claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of patents or other intellectual property rights. We may conclude that even if third parties are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our patents or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted costs of bringing claims against such third parties may be too high or otherwise not in the interest of our company. Finally, even if our patent applications are granted, competitors or infringers of such patents could successfully challenge their validity or enforceability.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents and our patents may be invalidated or narrowly interpreted, in which event our competitiveness and value may be undermined.\nOur key technological innovations, including innovations that are currently commercialized in our products and innovations that we plan to deploy in the future, are described in our issued patents and pending patent applications. There is no assurance that the pending applications will result in issued patents. Further, to the extent that we endeavor to enforce our currently issued patents or any patents that are issued in the future, an alleged infringer is likely to assert that it has not infringed any claim of the applicable patent(s) and that the applicable patent(s) is, in any event, invalid or unenforceable. There can be no assurance that we will overcome those defenses. Further, if one or more of our patents are held to be invalid or unenforceable, or if claims of those patents are interpreted narrowly, or if patents fail to issue from our pending applications, our competitiveness and value may be undermined.\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our total addressable market are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be affected and our business would be harmed.\nMarket estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. The principal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include: the size of the total addressable market for commercial vehicles in North America and Europe, regulatory developments driven by consumer and societal pressures to reduce CO2, commitments by large logistics and commercial vehicle OEMs to convert to BEV fleets, and our ability to maintain and expand our technological and operational advantage over competitors. Our market opportunity is also based on the assumption that our existing and future offerings will be more attractive to our customers and potential customers than competing products. If these assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMaintaining our manufacturing operations will require significant capital expenditures, and our inability or failure to maintain our operations would have a material adverse impact on our market share and ability to generate revenue.\nWe released our first commercial vehicle products to the market in 2018, and we plan to begin producing these products at increased scale for existing and new customers. We will be required to incur significant capital expenditures as we grow our production operations to meet customer demand. If we are unable or fail to adequately maintain our manufacturing capacity or quality control processes, we could lose customers, and there could be a material adverse impact on our market share and our ability to generate revenue.\nWe rely on complex machinery for our operations, and production involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance and costs.\nWe rely heavily on complex machinery for our operations, and our production will involve a significant degree of uncertainty and risk in terms of operational performance and costs. Our manufacturing facility consists of large-scale machinery combining many components. The manufacturing facility components are likely to suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to time and will depend on repairs and spare parts to resume operations, which may not be available when needed. Unexpected malfunctions of the manufacturing plant components may significantly affect the intended operational efficiency. Operational performance and costs can be difficult to predict and are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as, but not limited to, environmental hazards and remediation, costs associated with decommissioning of machines, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permits, damages or defects in electronic systems, industrial accidents, fire, and seismic activity and natural disasters. Should operational risks materialize, it may result in the personal injury to or death of workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to manufacturing facilities, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and potential legal liabilities, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nWe may be negatively impacted by an early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles and manufacturing technology change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing process more quickly than anticipated. The useful life of any equipment retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations could be harmed as a result.\nWe are currently dependent on a single manufacturing facility. If our facility becomes inoperable, we will be unable to produce our battery products and our business will be harmed.\nIn October 2021, we secured a new leased facility with approximately 215,000 square feet in Cypress, California. While we work to build-out the new facility, our 113,000 square foot headquarters and manufacturing facility is based in Vernon, California, where all our production and R&D activities take place. Our plant and the equipment we use to manufacture our battery modules, packs, and BMS would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to replace and qualify for use. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, fire and power outages, or by health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture our products for some period of time. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to produce our battery products or the backlog that could develop if all or a portion of our manufacturing facilities are inoperable for even a short period of time may result in harm to our reputation, a loss of customers or a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nWe are in the process of transitioning from our current manufacturing facility in Vernon, California to a new manufacturing facility in Cypress, California. If there are delays or other problems with this transition, our business might be disrupted and it might adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have secured an extension to the lease of our Vernon, California facility until July 31, 2022 and we are in the process of building-out the Cypress facility and preparing it for occupancy and use. Before the end of the Vernon lease, we will need to move all of our equipment, labs and inventory to Cypress. Even after we vacate the Vernon facility, we will receive additional equipment that will need to be installed for use. Our move to Cypress is a complicated process on an aggressive timeline. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete the transition on time or within a reasonable budget. The move could result in key equipment and labs being offline or unusable for extended periods of time. The inability to produce or test our battery\nproducts or the delays resulting from all or a portion of our manufacturing facilities being unavailable for even a short period of time may result in harm to our reputation, a loss of customers or a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nOur efforts to increase the scale and capacity of our manufacturing processes and systems could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe intend to extend our production capability by investing in automation and infrastructure to substantially increase the manufacturing capacity at our facilities, improve operating efficiency through the use of automation, and reduce delivery time for our products. We have recently expanded our footprint by entering into a new lease relating to approximately 215,000 square feet in Cypress, California and expect to significantly expand our total production capacity over the course of the next year, providing the room for more efficient and effective expansion as we grow. The build out of these expanded manufacturing operations could be disruptive to our operations, divert the attention of management and require significant investments. Our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity is subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals, delays in construction, potential supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality products at scale. If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines for expansion, our projected costs or capital efficiency expectations are not met or the anticipated production capacity for our expansion efforts is not as expected, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be harmed.\nOur efforts to increase the scale and capacity of our manufacturing processes and systems may result in temporary constraints upon our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner. In addition, system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities that impact ordering, production scheduling, manufacturing and other related processes are complex, and could impact or delay production. A prolonged delay in our ability to fill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our products and increase the size of our product inventories, causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our performance. Furthermore, delays in production could harm our brand, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our operations or manage our growth effectively.\nThe expansion of our manufacturing operations, the development of our marketing and sales organization and our organic growth have all increased and will continue to increase the complexity of our business. Expansion of our operations may place significant demands on our management, finances and other resources. Our ability to manage the anticipated future growth, should it occur, will depend upon a significant expansion of our accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation and subsequent improvement of a variety of systems, procedures and controls. There can be no assurance that significant problems in these areas will not occur. Any failure to expand these areas and implement and improve such systems, procedures and controls in an efficient manner at a pace consistent with the growth of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe may not be able to accurately plan our production based on our sales contracts, which may result in carrying excess raw material inventory.\nOur sales contracts typically provide for a forecast of twelve months on the quantity of products that our customers may purchase from us. We typically have a 16-week lead time to manufacture products to meet our customers\u2019 requirements once our customers place orders with us. To meet this delivery deadline, we generally make decisions on our production level and timing, procurement, facility requirements, personnel needs and other resources requirements based on estimates made in light of this forecast, our past dealings with such customers, market conditions and other relevant factors. Our customers\u2019 final purchase orders may not be consistent with our estimates. If the final purchase orders substantially differ from our estimates, we may have excess raw material inventory or material shortages. Excess inventory could result in unprofitable sales or write-offs as our products and certain materials can be susceptible to obsolescence and price declines. Expediting additional material to make up for any shortages within a short time frame could result in higher costs or cause us to adjust delivery dates. In either case, our results of operations would fluctuate from period-to-period.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety rules that can bring scrutiny from regulatory agencies and increase our costs.\nOur operations are subject to environmental, health and safety rules, laws and regulations, including those governing hazardous material handling, transportation, and cleanup and occupational health and safety. While we believe that the policies and programs we have in place are reasonably designed and implemented to assure compliance with these requirements and to avoid hazardous substance release liability with respect to our manufacturing facility leasehold (see the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations\u201d), there can be no guarantee that we will not confront new or more stringent compliance obligations that could impose substantial costs.\nWe may be subject to declining average selling prices, which may harm our revenue and gross profits.\nEVs, light EVs and energy storage are subject to declines in average selling prices due to rapidly evolving technologies, industry standards and consumer preferences. As a result, our customers may expect us as suppliers to cut our costs and lower the price of our products in order to mitigate the negative impact on their own margins.\nWe continue to refine and optimize our manufacturing process to provide our top-notch products at competitive prices. Our various designs are optimized and inherently flexible for high-rate manufacturing on the same production lines. Automation of critical assembly steps, coupled with patented component designs, makes our module production process economical, reliable and speedy. Despite our cost-effective production, we expect to face possible market-driven downward pricing pressures in the future. Our revenue and profitability will suffer if we are unable to offset any declines in our average selling prices by developing new or enhanced products with higher selling prices or gross profit margins, increasing our sales volumes or reducing the material costs of our products on a timely basis.\nOur battery packs and BMS rely on software and hardware that are highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally or by third parties, that are highly technical and complex and may require modification and updates over the life of a battery pack. In addition, certain of our products depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. Our software and hardware may contain, errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet the objectives. Some errors, bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects or technical limitations may be found within our software and hardware. Although we attempt to remedy any issues that we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production, or may not be to the satisfaction of our customers. If we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, we may suffer damage to our brand, loss of customers, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInability to leverage vehicle and customer data could impact our software algorithms and impact our R&D efforts.\nWe rely on data collected from the use of fleet vehicles outfitted with our products, including vehicle data and data related to battery usage statistics. We use this data in connection with our software algorithms and the research, development and analysis of our products. Our inability to obtain this data or the necessary rights to use this data could result in delays or otherwise negatively impact our R&D efforts.\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives due to policy changes or government regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the EV industry or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel and EV industry generally or our battery power solutions. While certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production, alternative fuel and EVs have been available in the past, there is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future or that they will remain at current levels. In particular, our business is affected by federal, state and local tax credits, rebates, grants and other government programs and incentives that promote the use of EVs. Additionally, our business is affected by laws, rules and regulations that require reductions in carbon emissions or the use of renewable fuels, such as the California Low Carbon Fuel Standards and the\nOregon Clean Fuels Program. These programs and regulations, which have the effect of encouraging the demand for EVs, could expire or be repealed or amended for a variety of reasons. For example, parties with an interest in gasoline and diesel, natural gas or other alternative vehicles or vehicle fuels, including lawmakers, regulators, policymakers, environmental or advocacy organizations, OEMs, trade groups, suppliers or other powerful groups, may invest significant time and money in efforts to delay, repeal or otherwise negatively influence regulations and programs that promote battery powered vehicles. Many of these parties have substantially greater resources and influence than we have. Further, changes in federal, state or local political, social or economic conditions, including a lack of legislative focus on these programs and regulations, could result in their modification, delayed adoption or repeal. Any failure to adopt, delay in implementation, expiration, repeal or modification of these programs and regulations, or the adoption of any programs or regulations that encourage the use of other alternative fuels or alternative vehicles over battery power, would reduce the market for batteries as a source of power and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.\nOur operations are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards. For example, we have received a subpoena from the SEC for the production of documents and information primarily relating to the Company\u2019s March 30, 2021 announcement of possible or actual supply disruption relating to battery cells. While the inquiry is in preliminary stages and no allegations of misconduct have been made, we have and will continue to cooperate with these and any other regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries.\nAny determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor, customer or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation. Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, and it potentially could create negative publicity that could harm our business and/or reputation.\nWe will face risks associated with potential international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business.\nWe will face risks associated with any potential international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. In the future we may have subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in such jurisdictions. We may be subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to manufacture or sell our products and require significant management attention. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 conforming our products to various international regulatory requirements where those products are sold, which requirements may change over time;\n\u2022 United States and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\n\u2022 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022 political instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and\n\u2022 the strength of international economies.\nIf we fail to address these risks successfully, our business and prospects could be negatively impacted.\nOur business could be adversely affected by trade tariffs or other trade barriers.\nIn recent years, China and the United States have each imposed tariffs, and there remains a potential for further trade barriers. These barriers may escalate into a trade war between China and the United States. Tariffs could potentially impact our\nraw material prices and impact any plans to sell products in China. In addition, these developments could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit risk which could have a material adverse impact on the market value of our investment portfolio.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio primarily consists of U.S. government securities, municipal securities, corporate debt, commercial paper, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, the values of which are subject to market price volatility resulting from interest rate movements, changes in credit risk and financial market conditions. If such investments suffer market price declines, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be an impairment, including an allowance for credit loss. We also may realize losses to the extent that investments are sold prior to maturity.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe transact business globally. Although transactions primarily are denominated in U.S. Dollars and are related to our cost of revenue, there could be negative impacts if the value of the U.S. Dollar depreciates against foreign currencies to the extent that suppliers and vendors raise prices for materials or services that we purchase. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we conduct, or in the future may conduct, activities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. The FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to a \u201cforeign official\u201d for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. The U.K. Bribery Act also prohibits non-governmental \u201ccommercial\u201d bribery and soliciting or accepting bribes. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations may not be sufficient and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, and business partners could engage in improper conduct for which we may be held responsible.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering or financial and economic sanctions laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition, changes in economic sanctions laws in the future could adversely impact our business and investments in our shares.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur products and solutions, including components of our products, are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. U.S. export control laws and regulations and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. In addition, complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Exports of our products and technology must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we, and even some of our employees, could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers.\nIn addition, changes in our products or solutions or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products and solutions in international markets, increase costs due to changes in import and export duties and taxes, prevent our customers from deploying our products and solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products and solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws and regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products and solutions, decreased ability to export or sell our products and solutions to customers, and decreased ability to import components or parts critical to the manufacture of our products. Any decreased use of our products and solutions, limitation on our ability to export or sell our products and solutions, or limitation on our ability to import components or parts would likely adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur products might fail to qualify as \u201cdomestic origin\u201d for purposes of \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements imposed on the recipients of U.S. Government grants.\nSome of our customers are recipients of grants subject to regulations implemented by the U.S. Federal Transit Authority for purchases of rolling stock, including \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements codified at 49 C.F.R. Part 661. In some cases our customers must ensure that our products, when incorporated into rolling stock subject to \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements, qualify as \u201cdomestic origin\u201d components or subcomponents. Some of our products are manufactured using parts or components that are imported from other countries. If our products manufactured from imported parts or components fail to meet the regulatory thresholds to qualify as \u201cdomestic origin\u201d under the applicable regulations, we might be disqualified or otherwise precluded from supplying those products to customers that are subject to applicable \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements, or we might be liable to those customers for having failed to comply with certifications or representations that are products are \u201cdomestic origin,\u201d each of which would likely adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in public policies affecting the development and more widespread adoption of EVs could affect the demand for our products.\nSales to EV producers account for a large portion of our battery sales. If the market for EVs does not develop, demand for our products could be harmed. As a result, our success depends, in part, on laws that affect demand for EVs. For example, laws compelling the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could create opportunity for increased sales of our batteries for incorporation in EVs. California proposed the world\u2019s first zero-emission sales mandate on commercial trucks, including that 40 percent of trucks be zero-emission by 2035 and 100% by 2045. As of July 2021, at least 47 states and the District of Columbia offer incentives to support deployment of EVs or alternative fuel vehicles and supporting infrastructure, either through state legislation or private utility incentives within the state, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia announced a joint memorandum of understanding, committing to a goal of ensuring that 100 percent of all new medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales be zero emission vehicles by 2050 with an interim target of 30 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2030. Eliminating or phasing out such incentives could have the opposite effect. The financial success of our EV producing customers may depend, in part, on their ability to sell tradable regulatory emission credits. Laws that restrict or diminish the value of such credits may lessen our EV producing customers\u2019 demand for our batteries.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including failing to attract and integrate qualified personnel, we may not be able to develop, produce, market and sell our battery pack, modules, or BMS software and services successfully.\nAny failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We intend to expand our operations significantly. We expect our future expansion to include, among other things:\n\u2022 expanding the management team;\n\u2022 hiring and training new personnel;\n\u2022 leveraging consultants to assist with company growth and development;\n\u2022 conducting market research and analysis;\n\u2022 controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n\u2022 expanding design, production, and service departments;\n\u2022 implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes; and\n\u2022 expanding our market share in international markets, including Europe and Asia.\nOur success depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train and develop other highly qualified personnel, in particular engineers specializing in various disciplines, including battery design and production. Experienced and highly skilled employees are in high demand and competition for these employees can be intense. Our ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on our ability to provide competitive compensation packages. We may not be able to attract, integrate, train, motivate or retain additional highly qualified personnel, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and harm our financial results.\nOur customers depend on our support organization to resolve any technical issues relating to our products. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the quality of our products, our business reputation and on strong recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly responsive technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly-responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing and prospective customers, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe offer technical support services with our products and may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for support services, particularly as we increase the size of our customer base. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. It is difficult to predict demand for technical support services and if demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our customers. Additionally, increased demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nThe design, manufacture, sale and servicing of our battery products is capital-intensive. As a company still in the early stages of growth, we are consuming cash on a net basis and may need to raise additional capital to fund our ongoing operations, expand our operations, continue research, development and design efforts, and improve infrastructure. As of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments were approximately $119.9 million and in February 2022 we used approximately $28.6 million of our cash to purchase BorgWarner\u2019s ownership stake in the BorgWarner JV. We may need to raise additional funds in order to fund our ongoing operations, expand our operations, continue research, development and design efforts, and improve infrastructure. To be prepared to continue funding the various key initiatives supporting growth of the business, we are assessing various options associated with our capital structure.\nIn February 2022, we announced that we had secured a $350 million commitment allowing us, but not obligating us, to sell shares of our Common Stock to an investor for up to a period of two years. Despite this commitment, and depending on certain restrictions or factors that may apply, there can be no guarantee as to the amount of Common Stock that may be sold nor as to the amount of cash that may be raised by the Company as a result of such sales if they occur.\nWe expect to continue to explore additional options to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity related or debt securities, or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe previously were the victim of a data breach resulting in publication of proprietary source code.\nWe discovered on August 5, 2020 that, without our knowledge or authorization, in mid-July 2020 a hacker published on the Internet the source code for the earliest version (1.0) of our battery management firmware (the individual also published source code belonging to 40 other companies). Since then, we have installed tools and tighter procedures to protect us again\npotential similar hacker penetrations. There is no evidence that the hacker obtained access to other source code of Legacy Romeo, which was stored on different servers with stronger security protections, and we have released a new version of the battery management firmware. So far, there has been no evidence revealing our copyright is breached. Nevertheless, the unauthorized publication of version 1.0 of such firmware may have eliminated trade secret protection for such firmware, which would cause us to have to resort to copyright protection in case of unauthorized use.\nWe rely on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents or security breaches, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. Cybersecurity incidents also could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause unauthorized payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient, or to permit unauthorized access to systems. While we employ a number of protective measures, including firewalls, network infrastructure vulnerability scanning, anti-virus and endpoint detection and response technologies, these measures may fail to prevent or detect attacks on our systems and operations. A material cybersecurity incident or security breach could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our business operations, damage to our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIn addition, our hardware and software or third-party components and software that we utilize in our products may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation or security of the products. The costs to us to eliminate or mitigate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and, if our efforts to address these problems are not successful, such problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nAny claim that our products or systems are subject to a cybersecurity risk, whether valid or not, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our revenues and results of operations. We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business as well as information from our suppliers and customers. Breaches of our or any of our third-party suppliers\u2019 security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or suppliers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us or our customers or suppliers to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nTo the extent we experience cyber-security incidents in the future, our relationships with our customers and suppliers may be materially impacted, our brand and reputation may be harmed and we could incur substantial costs in responding to and remediating the incidents and in resolving any investigations or disputes that may arise with respect to them, any of which would cause our business, operations, or products to be adversely affected. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing and adding further data protection measures could be significant.\nOur employees, distributors, consultants and other commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, distributors, consultants and other commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other activities that violate laws and regulations, including production standards, U.S. federal and state fraud, abuse, data privacy and security laws, other similar non-U.S. laws or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-\ncompliance, imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. We may not maintain as much insurance coverage as other companies do. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisk Relating to Our Management\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our key executive officers and senior management team and the loss of one or more of these employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. These executive officers are \u201cat-will\u201d employees and, therefore, may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. We also rely on our management team in the areas of R&D, marketing, services and general administrative functions. If one or more of our other senior executives are unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in their present positions, we would be significantly disadvantaged. Moreover, if any of our current or former senior executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Each of our executive officers has entered into an agreement with the Company that contains confidentiality provisions. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.\nWe do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any officer. Any failure by our management team and our employees to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur management may not be successful in operating a public company.\nCertain of our executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company, and many of our executive officers have recently joined the Company. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage a company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Management may be required to devote time and resources to dealing with the complex laws pertaining to public companies, which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of our business. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the U.S. may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention, and the increases in legal, accounting and compliance expenses may be greater than we anticipate.\nAs a result of operating as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE, including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Compliance with these rules and regulations can be burdensome. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our historical legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance than we obtained as a private company, and could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors as compared to when we were a private company. In addition, we expect to incur significant expenses\nand devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE, including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. We have hired and may continue to need to hire additional accounting and financial staff, and engage outside consultants, all with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and maintain an internal audit function, which will increase our operating expenses. Moreover, we have and could continue to incur additional compensation costs in the event that we decide to pay cash compensation closer to that of other public companies, which would increase our general and administrative expenses and could materially and adversely affect our profitability. We are evaluating these rules and regulations, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our Common Stock may be volatile.\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in our industry;\n\u2022the issuance and/or sale of Common Stock or the incurrence of debt to raise cash;\n\u2022our ability to raise capital adequate to sustain and/or grow our business and support our operations;\n\u2022 mergers and strategic alliances in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 market prices and conditions in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 changes in government regulation;\n\u2022 potential or actual military conflicts or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022 comments by securities analysts;\n\u2022 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\u2022 announcements concerning us or our competitors; and\n\u2022 the general state of the securities markets.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of our Common Stock.\nWe expect that securities research analysts will establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on our business downgrades our securities or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Common Stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our business or fails to publish\nreports on our business regularly, the price of our Common Stock or its trading volume could decline. While we currently have limited research analyst coverage of the Company, if analyst coverage remains limited, declines or is eliminated completely, the trading price and volume for our Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate in all respects. If our guidance varies from actual results due to our assumptions and internal projections not being met, or if our publicly announced guidance fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the market value of our Common Stock could decline significantly.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had warrants outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,290,243 shares of Common Stock, options outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,106,349 shares of Common Stock and 3,824,397 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock awards. As of December 31, 2021, we also had the ability to issue up to 14,796,370 shares under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. We may also issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances.\nIn February 2022, we entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSEPA\u201d) with YA II PN, Ltd. (\u201cYorkville\u201d), which is an affiliate of Yorkville Advisors. Pursuant to the SEPA, we have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to sell to Yorkville up to $350 million of shares of Common Stock at any time during the two-year term of the agreement. Despite this commitment, and depending on certain restrictions or factors that may apply, there can be no guarantee as to the amount of Common Stock that may be sold, the price at which shares of Common Stock are sold, or the amount of cash that may be raised by the Company as a result of such sales if they occur.\nOur issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects:\n\u2022 our existing stockholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest will decrease;\n\u2022 the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n\u2022 the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of Common Stock may be diminished; and\n\u2022 the market price of shares of our Common Stock may decline.\nFuture resales of our Common Stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe sale or possibility of sale of shares of Common Stock, including by our officers and directors and certain of our stockholders could have the effect of increasing the volatility in share price of our Common Stock or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock. Such sale or the perception that these sales might occur could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) contain anti-takeover provisions that could adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that will limit the ability of others to acquire control of the Company or cause it to engage in change-of-control transactions, including, among other things:\n\u2022 provisions that authorize our board of directors, without action by our stockholders, to issue (i) additional shares of Common Stock and (ii) preferred stock with preferential rights determined by our board of directors;\n\u2022 provisions that permit only (i) the chairperson of our board, (ii) our chief executive officer, or (iii) a majority of our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders and therefore do not permit our stockholders to call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022 provisions that impose advance notice requirements and other requirements and limitations on the ability of stockholders to propose matters for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their Common Stock at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of the Company in a tender offer or similar transaction.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. We cannot be certain that a court will decide that this provision is either applicable or enforceable, and if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision is applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the choice of forum provision will not apply to claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe uncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur operating results are directly affected by the general global economic conditions of the industries in which our major customer groups operate. Our business is highly dependent on the economic and market conditions in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. Sales of our battery packs and BMS for truck fleets, for example, depend significantly on demand for new EV transportation by large consumer companies. The uncertainty in global economic conditions varies by geographic segment and can result in substantial volatility in global credit markets. These conditions affect our business by reducing prices that our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products or by reducing the demand for our products, which could in turn negatively impact our sales and result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to grow, or if we fail to manage future growth effectively, our revenue may not increase and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to grow, and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. To manage our current and anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our infrastructure, financial and accounting systems and controls. We must also attract, train and retain a significant number of engineers, sales and marketing personnel, customer support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel and management personnel, and the availability of such personnel may be constrained.\nAs we continue to grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our profitability and our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel who are essential for our future success. If we do not effectively manage our growth, we may not be able to execute on our business plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements or manufacture high-quality products. Additionally, we may not be able to expand and upgrade our infrastructure to accommodate future growth.\nFailure to effectively manage our growth could also lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, financial losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees. Our growth is expected to require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new products and services. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase or may grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.\nA change in our product mix may cause our results of operations to differ substantially from the anticipated results in any particular period.\nOur overall profitability may not meet expectations if our products, customers or geographic mix are substantially different than anticipated. Our profit margins vary among products, customers and geographic markets. Consequently, if our mix of any of these is substantially different from what is anticipated in any particular period, our profitability could be lower than anticipated.\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will fluctuate in the future. The demand for our products is driven largely by the demand for the end-product applications that are powered by our products. Accordingly, the battery industry for electric transportation is affected by market conditions that are often outside our control. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period due to a number of factors, including seasonal variations in consumer demand for batteries and their end applications, industry-wide technological changes, supply shortages, the loss of a key customer and the postponement, rescheduling or cancellation of large orders by a key customer. As a result of these factors and other risks discussed in this section, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon to predict our future performance.\nFailure to fully implement and maintain adequate financial, information technology and management processes and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies, which could lead to errors in our financial reporting and adversely affect our business.\nAs a private company, we were not required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting, our management was not required to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls and our auditors were not required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a public company, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nIn addition, we are subject to the SEC\u2019s internal control over financial reporting auditor attestation requirements. We might not be able to complete or sustain our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. In addition, our\ncurrent controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of poor design, inadequate systems, inadequate personnel training, and changes in our business, including increased complexity resulting from increased or more complex regulations, and any international expansion. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect the results of assessments by our independent registered public accounting firm and their attestation reports.\nChanges in tax laws may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, U.S. federal tax legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the IRS with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), has already modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business and growth strategy and impact the price of our Common Stock.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing recently. Volatility in the price of our Common Stock or other factors may in the future cause us to become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and our board of director\u2019s attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist shareholder matters. Further, the price of our Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.", "PERMNO": 18533, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "RMG"}
