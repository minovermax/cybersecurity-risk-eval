RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 began to impact the population of Wuhan, China. The continued spread of COVID-19 globally has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the global economy and financial markets. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate, which could negatively impact our business. National, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, although intended to protect the population, are having serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the COVID-19 outbreak has not caused material financial impact to our business. Financial impacts associated with the COVID-19 outbreak may include, but are not limited to, delays in critical development and commercialization activities and potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the outbreak, furloughs of employees disruption of supply chains, demand for our product and services, restrictions on the movement of employees, and a decline in value of assets held by us, including equipment. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, the COVID-19 outbreak is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to treat its impact, makes it difficult to accurately forecast any effects on our results of operations for 2021 and beyond.\nAs a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, we may not have the materials or capacity to continue our development efforts according to our schedule. Further, there may be logistics issues, including our ability and to quickly resume operations, if necessary, and transportation demands that may cause further delays. While the disruptions and restrictions on the ability to travel, quarantines, and reduced operation as well as general limitations on movement are expected to be temporary, the duration of the disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact on the development and commercialization of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe macro-economic environment in the United States and abroad has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our ability to raise capital, which may potentially impact our ability to grow our operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which could increase the cost of capital and could impact our ability to raise additional capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. If we are unable to raise funds as and when we need them, this may impact the Company\u2019s strategic and growth initiatives. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth, could have a negative impact on our business. It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.\nWe depend on a small number of large customers and the loss of one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor fiscal 2020, we had one customer contributing 5.1% of total revenues and our top five customers, in the aggregate, generating approximately 21.0% of total revenues. We expect that our top five customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. For fiscal 2019, we had one customer contributing 12.4% of total revenues and our top five customers, in the aggregate, generating approximately 28.6% of total revenues. We have had in the past large customers terminate their relationship with us and it is possible that any of our large customers could decide to terminate their relationship with us in the future. The loss of one or more of our top five customers, or a substantial decrease in demand by any of those customers for our services and solutions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that result in increased cost of sales, decreased revenues and lower average selling prices and gross margins, all of which could harm our operating results.\nOur information systems, like those of other software and technology companies, are vulnerable to the threat of cyber security and data privacy risks.\nOur business involves the storage, management, and transmission of the proprietary information of our customers, including personal, financial, and other sensitive or confidential information of our customers\u2019 insureds. Cyberattacks and other efforts by bad actors to steal personal information, to steal proprietary and sensitive company information, and to disrupt service are on the rise, and the methods used to attack, to obtain unauthorized access to, to disable, to degrade, or to otherwise compromise our systems, our software, and our applications are continuously changing and evolving. We may be unable to anticipate or detect successfully these methods or implement adequate preventive measures. Moreover, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other vulnerabilities that could unexpectedly compromise or lead to the compromise of our systems, our software, our applications, or the information security and privacy of the proprietary and personal information stored, managed, and transmitted by or on those systems, software, or applications.\nAlthough we have in place control procedures and security measures to protect the proprietary and personal data we store, manage and transmit for our customers, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to detect or prevent interceptions, intrusions, break-ins, security breaches, theft, the introduction of viruses or malicious code, or other disruptions or attacks that may jeopardize the security, confidentiality, or integrity of the proprietary and personal information stored, managed, or transmitted by our systems, software, applications, and products. Security breaches or other malicious attacks of our systems, software, applications, and products could result in system or service disruptions or the theft, misappropriation, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or compromise of personal and proprietary information. In addition, security breaches or other malicious attacks of our systems, software, applications, and products could also result in impact to or compromise of the systems of our customers who utilize our software, applications, and products. Our systems, software, applications, and productions are also exposed to computer viruses, denial of service attacks and bulk unsolicited commercial email, or spam. Despite the security measures we have in place, these events could cause a loss of service and data to customers.\nIf our products or systems experience data security breaches or there is unauthorized access to or release of our customers\u2019 data, we may lose current or future customers and our reputation and business may be harmed. We may also incur liabilities to repair or replace our systems or in connection with litigation or regulatory enforcement actions that may result from such breaches.\nWe are subject to data security and data privacy laws that are becoming more widespread, burdensome, and increasingly require notification of security breaches to affected individuals, regulators, customers, and other third parties. The occurrence of a security breach impacting our systems, software, applications, or products, or the claim that the Company has suffered such a security breach, whether accurate or not, could result in adverse publicity, loss of customer confidence, increased costs, lost sales and profits, criminal penalties, civil liabilities, and reputational harm. This could lead to the loss of current and potential customers. In addition, a security breach may require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, remedy, mitigate, alleviate, and further protect against the security breach and related problems. We may also be required to make significant expenditures to repair our systems, software, applications, and products in the event that they are damaged or destroyed or if the delivery of our services to our customers is disrupted; this could result in harm to our business and operations. Further, we may not be able to remedy these problems in a timely manner, or at all. Even the perception that the privacy of proprietary or personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements or that our systems, software, applications, and products are unsecure or unstable could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our products and services. The insurance we carry may not provide coverage adequate to compensate us fully for losses that may occur or litigation that may be instituted against us in these circumstances.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, other federal agencies and state consumer protection authorities have investigated and brought a number of enforcement actions against U.S. companies for alleged deficiencies in their data security practices, and they may continue to bring such actions. Investigations and enforcement actions, which may or may not be based upon actual cyber-attacks or security breaches, or other disclosures of personal or proprietary information, present an ongoing risk to us, could result in a loss of customers, damage to our reputation and monetary damages. Other liability could include claims, including class action claims, from customers or consumers alleging misrepresentation or violation of our privacy and data security practices, claims alleging violations of the California Consumer Privacy Act or similar statutes in consideration by other states, as well as claims alleging unfair and deceptive trade practices, negligence, or breach of contract. Any such liability could decrease our profitability and materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe face intense and growing competition. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be seriously harmed through the loss of customers or increased negative pricing pressure.\nThe market for our services and solutions is extremely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the variety of services and solutions they provide.\nSome of our current and potential direct competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, greater brand recognition and, we believe, a larger base of customers. In addition, competitors may operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share. These direct competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote more resources to the promotion, sale and development of their services and solutions than us and there can be no assurance that our current and future competitors will not be able to develop services and solutions comparable or superior to those offered by us at more competitive prices. As a result, in the future, we may suffer from an inability to offer competitive services and solutions or be subject to negative pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we cannot successfully retain key members of our management team or retain, hire, train and manage other key employees, particularly in the sales and customer service areas.\nOur continued success is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of our executive officers and senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our President and our executive management team. Our success also depends on our continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees throughout our business. We are particularly substantially dependent on our skilled technical employees and our sales and customer service employees. Competition for skilled technical, sales and customer service professionals is intense and our competitors often attempt to solicit our key employees and may be able to offer them employment benefits and opportunities that we cannot. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract, integrate or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. In addition, our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue will depend, in large part, on our success in effectively training sufficient numbers of technical, sales and customer service personnel. New employees require significant training before they achieve full productivity. Our recent and planned hires may not be as productive as anticipated, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, or hiring, training and integrating new employees, or if our current or future employees perform poorly, growth in the sales of our services may not materialize and our business will suffer.\nRisks associated with potential acquisitions and expansion activities or divestitures may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time, we consider acquisitions and may consider divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and decreased geographic or customer diversification.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any acquisitions or divestitures will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow. Any such failure could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict the frequency, size or timing of our acquisitions, as this will depend on the availability of prospective target opportunities at valuation levels, we find attractive and the competition for such opportunities from other parties. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results related to: the total cost of integration; the retention of key personnel; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; continued growth; or the overall performance of the acquired company or combined entity. We also may encounter difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approvals and unexpected contingent liabilities can arise from the businesses we acquire. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a business or assets we may acquire may deteriorate after an acquisition agreement is signed or after an acquisition closes, which could result in impairment or other expenses and charges which would reduce our operating results. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly. If we are not able to integrate successfully past or future acquisitions, there is a risk that results of operations could be adversely affected. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, there is a risk that we will not be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. In addition, we may sell or restructure portions of our business. Any divestitures or restructuring may result in significant expenses and write-offs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and may involve additional risks, including difficulties in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. We may not be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered in connection with any acquisition or divestitures we might make.\nInflation\nAlthough we cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable thereto, our net revenues and results of operations have been affected by inflation experienced in the U.S., India and other economies in which we operate through increased costs of employee compensation and other operational expenses during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. To the extent permitted by the marketplace for our products and services, we attempt to recover increases in costs by periodically increasing prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to offset such higher costs could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology, which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop new services and solutions and to remain competitive. If our competitors learn of our proprietary technology or processes, they may use this information to produce services and solutions that are equivalent or superior to our services and solutions, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial position. Our employees and consultants may breach their obligations not to reveal our confidential information, and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages. Even in the absence of such breaches, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to our competitors, or be independently discovered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and variable, depends upon many factors outside our control, and could cause us to expend significant time and resources prior to earning associated revenues.\nThe typical sales cycle for our products and services is lengthy and unpredictable, requires pre-purchase evaluation by a significant number of employees in our customers\u2019 organizations, and often involves a significant operational decision by our customers. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our products, including the technical capabilities of our products and the potential cost savings achievable by organizations deploying our products. Customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process, which frequently involves not only our products, but also those of our competitors and can result in a lengthy sales cycle. Moreover, a purchase decision by a potential customer typically requires the approval of several senior decision makers, including the boards of directors of our customers. Our sales cycle for new customers is typically one to two years and can extend even longer in some cases. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, we sometimes commit to include specific functions in our base product offering at the request of a customer or group of customers and are unable to recognize license revenues until the specific functions have been added to our products. Providing this additional functionality may be time consuming and may involve factors that are outside of our control. The lengthy and variable sales cycle may also have a negative impact on the timing of our revenues, causing our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from period to period.\nOur business depends on customers renewing and expanding their license and maintenance contracts for our products. A decline in our customer renewals and expansions could harm our future results of operations.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their term licenses after their license period expires, and these licenses may not be renewed on the same or more favorable terms. Moreover, under certain circumstances, our customers have the right to cancel their license agreements before they expire. In addition, our term and perpetual license customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance arrangements after the expiration of the initial contractual period. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may fluctuate or decline because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our products and services, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors. In addition, in some cases, our customers have a right to exercise a perpetual buyout of their term licenses at the end of the initial contract term. If our customers do not renew their term licenses for our solutions or renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may decline or grow more slowly than expected and our profitability may be harmed.\nOur implementation cycle is lengthy and variable, depends upon factors outside our control, and could cause us to expend significant time and resources prior to earning associated revenues.\nThe implementation and testing of our products by our customers takes several months or longer and unexpected implementation delays and difficulties can occur. Implementing our products typically involves integration with our customers\u2019 systems, as well as adding their data to our system. This can be complex, time-consuming and expensive for our customers and can result in delays in the implementation and deployment of our products. The lengthy and variable implementation cycle may also have a negative impact on the timing of our revenues, causing our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from period to period. The impact of COVID-19 could further impact these timelines.\nOur product development cycles are lengthy, and we may incur significant expenses before we generate revenues, if any, from new products.\nBecause our products are complex and require rigorous testing, development cycles can be lengthy, taking us up to two years to develop and introduce new products. Moreover, development projects can be technically challenging and expensive. The nature of these development cycles may cause us to experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development and the time we generate revenues, if any, from such expenses. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction or improvement of products that are competitive in the marketplace, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, anticipated customer demand for a product we are developing could decrease after the development cycle has commenced. Such decreased customer demand may cause us to fall short of our sales targets, and we may nonetheless be unable to avoid substantial costs associated with the product\u2019s development. If we are unable to complete product development cycles successfully and in a timely fashion and generate revenues from such future products, the growth of our business may be harmed.\nFailure to meet customer expectations on the implementation of our products could result in negative publicity and reduced sales, both of which would significantly harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nWe provide our customers with upfront estimates regarding the duration, budget and costs associated with the implementation of our products. Failing to meet these upfront estimates and the expectations of our customers for the implementation of our products could result in a loss of customers and negative publicity regarding us and our products and services, which could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and sell additional products and services to existing customers. Such failure could result from our product capabilities or service engagements by us, our system integrator partners or our customers\u2019 IT employees. The consequences could include and have included: monetary credits for current or future service engagements, reduced fees for additional product sales, and a customer\u2019s refusal to pay their contractually obligated license, maintenance or service fees. In addition, time-consuming implementations may also increase the amount of services personnel we must allocate to each customer, thereby increasing our costs and adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to develop, introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our products, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to develop, introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our products to meet evolving customer requirements. However, we cannot assure you that this process can be maintained. If we fail to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products, our business could be adversely affected, especially if our competitors are able to introduce products with enhanced functionality. We plan to continue our investment in product development in future periods. It is critical to our success for us to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards and customer requirements and to successfully introduce new, enhanced and competitive products to meet our customers\u2019 and prospective customers\u2019 needs on a timely basis. However, we cannot assure you that revenues will be sufficient to support the future product development that is required for us to be competitive. Although we may be able to release new products in addition to enhancements to existing products, we cannot assure you that our new or upgraded products will be accepted by the market, will not be delayed or canceled, will not contain errors or \u201cbugs\u201d that could affect the performance of the products or cause damage to users\u2019 data, or will not be rendered obsolete by the introduction of new products or technological developments by others. If we fail to develop products that are competitive in technology and price and fail to meet customer needs, our market share will decline, and our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may be subject to significant liability claims if our core system software fails and the limitation of liability provided in our agreements may not protect us, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nMost of our agreements with our customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims. It is possible, however, that the limitation of liability provisions contained in such agreements may not be enforced as a result of international, federal, state and local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. Breach of warranty or damage liability or injunctive relief resulting from such claims could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our software products may be deployed through cloud-based implementations, and if such implementations are compromised by data security breaches or other disruptions, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose customers or be subject to significant liabilities.\nAlthough some of our software products typically are deployed on our customers\u2019 premises, our customers may at times require our products to be deployed in cloud-based environments, in which our products and associated services are made available using an Internet-based infrastructure. At times, in cloud deployments, the infrastructure of third-party service providers is used by the customers at their own behest, which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, telecommunications failures, power loss and other system failures, disruptions and attacks.\nAny of these occurrences, whether intentional or accidental, could lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of operation of the servers of third-party service providers\u2019 used by our customers, and to the unauthorized use, access, acquisition or compromise of our software and/or the proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data stored, managed or transmitted by our software and products. The inability of service providers used by our customers to provide continuous access to their hosted services, and to secure their hosted services and associated customer information from unauthorized use, access, disclosure or compromise, could cause us to lose customers and to incur significant liability, and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully manage any changes to our business model, our results of operations could be harmed.\nTo address demand trends in the insurance industry, we now offer customers the use of our software products through a cloud-based offering in addition to our on-premises offering. Our software and cloud services involve the storage and transmission of data, including in some cases, personal data, and security breaches could result in the loss of this information, which in turn could result in litigation, breach of contract claims, indemnity obligations and other liabilities for us. In addition, market acceptance of our cloud-based offerings may be affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to price, security, reliability, performance, customer preference, public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations. Whether our product development efforts or business model transition will prove successful and accomplish our business objectives is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including but not limited to: customer demand, our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure, our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements, tax and accounting implications, and our costs. In addition, the metrics we and our investors use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve as significant trends emerge. If we are unable to successfully establish our current and new cloud offerings in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, our reputation could suffer and our results of operations could be harmed, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nIncorrect or improper use of our products or our failure to properly train customers on how to utilize our products could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nOur products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments. The proper use of our products requires training of the customer. If our products are not used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance may result. Our products may also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or their employees or third parties who are able to access or use our products. Because our customers rely on our products, services and maintenance support to manage a wide range of operations, the incorrect or improper use of our products, our failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our products, or our failure to properly provide maintenance services to our customers may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales of our products and services.\nWe are dependent on the reliability and performance of our internally developed systems and operations. Any difficulties in maintaining these systems, whether due to human error or otherwise, may result in service interruptions, decreased service quality for our customers, a loss of customers or increased expenditures.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on the reliability and performance of our services and solutions.\nWe have contractual obligations to provide service level credits to almost all of our application services provider (\u201cASP\u201d) customers against future invoices in the event that certain service disruptions occur. Furthermore, customers may terminate their ASP agreements with us as a result of significant service interruptions, or our inability, whether actual or perceived, to provide our services and solutions at the contractually required levels or at any time. If our services are unavailable, or customers are dissatisfied with our performance, we could lose customers, our revenue and profitability would decrease, and our business operations or financial position could be harmed. In addition, the software and workflow processes that underlie our ability to deliver our services and solutions have been developed primarily by our own employees and consultants. Malfunctions in the software we use, or human error could result in our inability to provide services or cause unforeseen technical problems. If we incur significant financial commitments to our customers in connection with our failure to meet service level commitment obligations, we may incur significant liability and our liability insurance and revenue reserves may not be adequate. In addition, any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenue and our operating results\nWe operate in a price sensitive market and we are subject to pressures from customers to decrease our fees for the services and solutions we provide. Any reduction in price would likely reduce our margins and could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe competitive market in which we conduct our business could require us to reduce our prices. If our competitors offer discounts on certain products or services in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other products, we may be required to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully. Any of these changes would likely reduce our margins and could adversely affect our operating results. Some of our competitors may bundle products and services that compete with us for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. In addition, many of the services and solutions that we provide, and market are not unique to us and our customers and target customers may not distinguish our services and solutions from those of our competitors. All of these factors could, over time, limit or reduce the prices that we can charge for our services and solutions. If we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced revenue resulting from lower prices would adversely affect our margins and operating results.\nIf we are unable to retain and grow our customer base, as well as their end-user base, our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected.\nIn order to execute our business plan successfully, we must maintain existing relationships with our customers and establish new relationships with additional businesses. If we are unable to diversify and extend our customer base, our ability to grow our business may be compromised, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf economic or other factors negatively affect the insurance industry, our customers and target customers may become unwilling or unable to purchase our services and solutions, which could cause our revenue to decline and impair our ability to operate profitably.\nMost of our existing and target customers operate in the insurance industry. If a material portion of the insurance businesses that we service, or are looking to service, experience economic hardship, these customers may be unwilling or unable to expend resources on the services and solutions we provide, which would negatively affect the overall demand for our services and could cause our revenue to decline.\nIf we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological change, our business could suffer.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards. There can be no assurance that our current and future competitors will not be able to develop services or expertise comparable or superior to those we have developed or to adapt more quickly than us to new technologies, evolving industry standards or customer requirements. Failure or delays in our ability to develop services and solutions to respond to industry or user trends or developments and the actions of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, technical standards and product offerings will be a significant factor in the success of our current business and in expanding into new markets.\nIf we are unable to quickly react to changes in insurance laws and similar regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and update our products on a frequent basis, our customer base (as well as end-user base), revenue and profitability will be adversely affected. Such updates require significant investment, which may come at a cost.\nIn order for us to maintain and grow our customer base (as well as our customers\u2019 end-user base) and maintain and increase revenues and profit, we must maintain familiarity with legal and regulatory changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and update our existing products frequently. Frequent and timely product updates require significant investment in research and development and in personnel experienced in legal and regulatory matters as well as technical personnel. To maintain such a level of investment, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital, which may be costly, or require a reduction in other areas of our budget. Our inability to continually update our products as needed due to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to compete.\nLitigation could result in substantial costs to us and our insurance may not cover these costs.\nWe may be subject to litigation in our day to day operations, including, among other things, as a result of contract breaches, data security breaches and litigation relating to our employees such as workers\u2019 compensation, wage and other employment matters. While we maintain general liability insurance, cyber security insurance and other insurance and, in certain circumstances, attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from our provision of services, there can be no assurance that our insurance policies will cover any such claims, that such claims will not exceed insurance limits under our current policies or that our contract provisions will be enforceable in all circumstances or in all jurisdictions. Furthermore, litigation could result in substantial costs or divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our operations and result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect our business including our ability to maintain and grow our customer base.\nOur global operations are subject to complex risks, some of which might be beyond our control.\nWe have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services and solutions to clients globally. For fiscal 2020, approximately 89.3% of our revenues were attributable to the North American region, approximately 5.7% were attributable to the European region, and approximately 4.9% were attributable to the rest of the world, primarily the Asia-Pacific region. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations, including regulatory, economic, political and other uncertainties, fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur current international operations and our plans to expand our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u25cf increased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf the need to localize our products and licensing programs for international customers;\n\u25cf lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf increased exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards;\n\u25cf compliance with anticorruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, particularly in emerging market countries;\n\u25cf import and export license requirements, tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers;\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25cf weaker protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf multiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes; and\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nA portion of our assets and operations are located outside of the United States and we are subject to regulatory, tax, economic, political and other uncertainties in other foreign countries in which we operate.\nWe have significant offshore facilities in foreign countries, including India and Malaysia. Wages in these countries have historically increased at a faster rate than in the United States. If this trend continues in the future, it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins. Also, there is no assurance that, in future periods, competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in those countries, thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins.\nCertain of these countries have also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and have been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries. These events could materially adversely affect our operations in these countries. In addition, companies may decline to contract with us for services, even where these countries are not involved, because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources that may be viewed as less stable than those provided in the United States.\nIn addition, these countries have in the past experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries, including high inflation, erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange. Government actions concerning the economy in these countries could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us. In the past, certain of these governments have provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy, including the software development services industry. Programs that have benefited us include, among others, tax holidays, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation. Notwithstanding these benefits, as noted above, changes in government leadership or changes in policies in these countries that result in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the Indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations.\nAlthough we report our operating results in U.S. dollars, a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues, income from operations, other income (expense), net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. There is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities will be effective. In addition, in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations. Finally, as we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.\nOur shareholders may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the United States against our foreign subsidiaries or against some of our officers, directors or executive management or gaining access to our assets located outside the United States.\nSeveral of our operating subsidiaries are located outside the United States, including India, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland and a number of our officers, directors and executive management reside abroad. A portion of our assets are located in countries outside the United States. As a result, you may be unable to effect service of process upon our affiliates who reside outside the United States except in their jurisdiction of residence. In addition, you may be unable to enforce outside of the jurisdiction of these affiliates\u2019 residence judgments obtained against these individuals or entities in courts of the United States, including judgments predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States. You may also have difficulty gaining access to assets of us or our affiliates located outside the United State to the extent necessary to satisfy a judgment against us or one of our affiliates. In particular, should you seek to enforce a judgment of a United States court against us or one of our affiliates, directors or officers in a jurisdiction outside the United States, you may be unable to obtain recognition or enforcement of some or all of the amount of damages or other remedies awarded by the United States court. You may also be required to comply with laws or regulations applicable to relevant jurisdiction governing the repatriation of any money damages recovered from a court in such jurisdiction to the United States or another country.\nOur growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions.\nOur future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills, including those from developing countries, especially India. The ability of foreign nationals to work in the United States and Europe, where a significant proportion of our operations are located, depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits.\nImmigration and work permit laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement. Immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our international expansion strategy and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. The recently issued presidential proclamation on immigration in the US, could impact the scheduling and deployment of our global resources disrupting certain of our operations and ability to service our clients on premise and, if prolonged, could have an adverse effect on our business and could require to make changes in our personnel and cost structure, all of which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other valuable intellectual property. We presently hold no issued patents.\nOur ability to enforce our software license agreements, service agreements, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. To the extent that we seek to enforce our rights, we could be subject to claims that an intellectual property right is invalid, otherwise not enforceable, or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim. In addition, our assertion of intellectual property rights may result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights or assert other claims against us, which could harm our business. If we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations. In addition, governments may adopt regulations, or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others, or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business.\nWe generally allow in our agreements with our customers to place source code for our proprietary software in escrow. In most of those cases, the escrowed source code may be made available to such customers in the event that we were to file for bankruptcy or materially fail to support our products in the future. Release of our source code upon any such event may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our software; however, such customers would still be obligated to comply with the terms of our license agreements with them, which restricts the use of the software.\nOur services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot be sure that our services and solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may assert against us or our customers claims alleging infringement of patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to technologies or services that are important to our business. Infringement claims could harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions. In our contracts, we generally agree to indemnify our clients for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from potential infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial. Any claims that our products, services or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, may result in significant costs in defending and resolving such claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. In addition, as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to:\n\u25cf pay third-party infringement claims;\n\u25cf discontinue using, licensing, or selling particular products subject to infringement claims;\n\u25cf discontinue using the technology or processes subject to infringement claims;\n\u25cf develop other technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be costly or may not be possible; and/or\n\u25cf license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets, which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses. In addition, if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services, our revenue could be affected. If a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients, an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.\nWe expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights for software products and methods, technological solutions, and processes. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals or companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies. The risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to develop and license our intellectual property to our clients and other third parties. Any infringement claims or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our products may incorporate open source software, which may expose us to potential claims or litigation.\nSome of our products may incorporate software licensed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License. We use our methodology to ensure that our proprietary software is not combined with, and does not incorporate, open source software in ways that would require our proprietary software to be subject to an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty. The usage of open source software may subject us to claims from others seeking to enforce the terms of an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. Such claims could also result in litigation and may require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products, any of which could reduce or diminish the value of our products and have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company under U.S. securities laws and intend to take advantage of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements regarding internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u25cf exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved;\n\u25cf exemption from the requirement to provide pay for performance disclosure; and\n\u25cf exemption from the requirement to provide compensation ratio disclosure.\nWe also intend to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (\u201cJOBS\u201d) Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nMoreover, we also are eligible under the JOBS Act for an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or supplements to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we no longer are an emerging growth company.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period and (d) the last day of our fiscal year containing the fifth anniversary of the date on which shares of our common stock were offered in connection with the completion of our merger with Cover-All, which will be March 31, 2021.\nEven after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from the disclosure requirements described above, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and being subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statement. We will also be exempt from providing selected and supplemental financial information.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from an issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the exemption permitting us not to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nOur compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In connection with management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting during the second quarter as part of the preparation of the Company\u2019s income tax returns, we identified a material weakness related to the application of certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Management has put in place a remediation plan to address the material weakness as further set forth in Item 9A. Although we have put in place a plan to remediate our material weakness and expect it to be fully remediated by second quarter of our 2021 fiscal year, we cannot assure you that there will not be new material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its Section 404 reviews, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the value of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur status as an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements available to us as an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if we believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ. As a result, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements and the interests of our controlling shareholder may be different from other holders of our common stock.\nMajesco Limited owns 74.2% of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under the NASDAQ rules, a controlled company is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company. A controlled company may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u25cf a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u25cf director nominees be selected or recommended to the Board of Directors by a majority of independent directors or a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and that we have a written charter or board resolutions addressing the nominations process; and\n\u25cf we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWe are currently utilizing, and intend to continue to utilize, the exemption relating to the compensation committee and nominating committee, and we may utilize this exemption for so long as we are a controlled company. Accordingly, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.\nIt is also possible that the interests of Majesco Limited may, in some circumstances, conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders.\nAnti-takeover and similar provisions of California law and our governing documents may deter or prevent a future acquisition or change of control that our shareholders may consider favorable.\nAnti-takeover and similar provisions of California law and of our governing documents could make it more difficult for a third party, or an existing shareholder, to engage in a business combination with or acquire control of Majesco, even if shareholders may consider such transaction to be favorable to them. Such provisions may have the effect of discouraging a hostile bid, or delaying, preventing or deterring a merger, acquisition or tender offer in which Majesco\u2019s shareholders could receive a premium for their shares, or effect a proxy contest for control of Majesco or other changes in our management, particularly if such proposed transaction is opposed by our Board of Directors.\nUnder Section 1203 of the California Corporations Code (\u201cCCC\u201d), if an \u201cinterested person\u201d makes an offer to purchase the shares of some or all of our shareholders, we must obtain an affirmative opinion in writing as to the fairness of the offering price prior to completing the transaction. If after receiving an offer from such an \u201cinterested person\u201d, we receive a subsequent offer from a neutral third party, then we must notify our shareholders of this offer and afford each of them the opportunity to withdraw their consent to the \u201cinterested person\u201d offer.\nMoreover, even if shareholders may consider such a transaction to be favorable to them, the CCC may effectively prohibit a cash-out merger of minority shareholders by a majority shareholder of Majesco without the unanimous approval of the merger by our shareholders, which is often difficult to achieve in the case of a public company. Under Sections 1101 and 1101.1 of the CCC, a merger with a majority shareholder for cash consideration requires unanimous shareholder approval, except where (i) the party interested in effecting the merger already owns 90% or more of the voting power of the combined company (and could, therefore, accomplish such a cash-out of minority shareholders by means of a \u201cshort-form\u201d merger without the need for approval by the combined company\u2019s shareholders) or (ii) the California Commissioner of Corporations has granted its consent. In addition, under our articles of incorporation and bylaws, certain provisions may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, or for a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or management to occur.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Exaxe, such benefits may take longer to realize than expected or we may encounter significant difficulties integrating Exaxe\u2019s business into our operations. If the acquisition does not achieve its intended benefits, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that the acquisition of Exaxe will result in certain benefits, including certain cost synergies, drive product innovations and operational efficiencies; however, to realize these anticipated benefits, the business of Exaxe must be successfully combined with our business. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process that will require significant management attention and resources. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would limit the expected benefits of this acquisition to us. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u25cf difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u25cf difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u25cf conforming standards, controls, procedures, accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u25cf difficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures; and\n\u25cf challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of these factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and additional diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations are integrated successfully, the full benefits, including the synergies, cost savings, revenue growth, or other benefits that are expected, may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, and negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that the acquisition of Exaxe will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate.\nIf Exaxe Limited, a subsidiary of Exaxe, is not in compliance with its funding agreement with Enterprise Ireland, our business may be materially harmed.\nIn July 2016, Exaxe Limited, formerly the subsidiary of Exaxe, entered into a funding agreement with Enterprise Ireland pursuant to which Enterprise Ireland granted Exaxe Limited up to EUR 500 for purposes of research and development to be conducted in Ireland. Pursuant to the terms of the funding agreement, Exaxe Limited agreed to certain covenants including, among other things, ensuring that the controlling interest in Majesco or Exaxe Limited will not be changed without the prior written consent of Enterprise Ireland, not to use the grants for any purpose other than as set forth in the funding agreement, to comply with certain procurement and pay requirements, not to pledge or dispose of its grant-aided assets and to furnish Enterprise Ireland with audited accounts for each year until grants have been fully paid to Exaxe Limited. In the event that Exaxe Limited breaches any of the covenants contained in the funding agreement, Enterprise Ireland may, among other things, immediately cease making payments under the grant and/or seek repayment of any grants already paid to Exaxe Limited. In addition, in connection with the Exaxe Acquisition, we entered into a guarantee and indemnity agreement with Enterprise Ireland whereby we guaranteed payments owed by Exaxe Limited and agreed to indemnify Enterprise Ireland against any losses, liabilities and damages suffered as a result of any actions or otherwise incurred by Enterprise Ireland as a result of the failure by Exaxe Limited to pay amounts due pursuant to the terms of the funding agreement. In the event Enterprise Ireland ceases making payments or seeks repayment of any grants from either Exaxe Limited or us, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur ability to operate and manage the Exaxe business will be subject to certain restrictions during the earnout period and the entire earnout will be due if we sell the business.\nWe may be required to make certain earnout payments during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 pursuant to the terms of the Exaxe acquisition. The entire earnout amount, less any portion already paid, will become due and payable upon a sale of beneficial interests in a majority of the outstanding shares of Exaxe or its subsidiary or a sale or other disposal in whole or substantial part of the undertaking or assets of Exaxe or its subsidiary before the end of the earnout period. We will also be restricted from making certain changes to the business of Exaxe, or diverting or redirecting Exaxe\u2019s orders, revenue, customers, clients, suppliers or employees during the earnout period.\nThe transformation of our business from primarily selling solutions, which required a lot of implementation services and customizations to ready out of the box offerings, may result in seasonality of revenue.\nThe transformation of our business from primarily selling solutions, which required substantial implementation services and customizations, to ready out of the box offerings, will impact the way we have been recognizing our term and annual license fees in the past. While in the past our obligation to the customer was through the end of the life of the contract due to the nature of the software that was provided to the customer, the new ready out of the box, single package solutions will end our obligation on the license at the time when the product is considered as handed over to the customer. This will now require us to either recognize the entire committed license fee upfront or over the implementation period. This will increase the seasonal impact on our new multi-year annual license fees or term license fees.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we are unable to maintain the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Market, our common stock may be delisted, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market. To maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuation as a result of periodic variations in our revenues and results of operations. If we fail to meet any of the Nasdaq Global Market\u2019s listing standards, we may be delisted. In the event of delisting, trading of our common stock would most likely be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, which could have a material adverse effect on the market liquidity and value of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may have difficulty in selling those shares.\nWhile our common shares trade on the Nasdaq Global Market, our stock is thinly traded, and investors may have difficulty in selling their shares. The low trading volume of our common stock is outside of our control, and may not increase in the near future or, even if it does increase in the future, may not be maintained. Brokers effecting transactions in our common stock may also be subject to additional sales practice requirements under certain Exchange Act rules, including making inquiries into the suitability of investments for each customer or obtaining a prior written agreement for the specific stock purchase. Because of these additional obligations, some brokers will not affect transactions in our common stock.\nOur stock price has been volatile.\nQuarterly operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Factors that are difficult to predict, such as quarterly revenues and operating results, limited trading volumes and overall market performance, may have a significant effect on the price of our common stock. Revenues and operating results have varied considerably in the past from period to period and are likely to vary considerably in the future. We plan product development and other expenses based on anticipated future revenue. If revenue falls below expectations, financial performance is likely to be adversely affected because only small portions of expenses vary with revenue. As a result, quarterly period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon to predict future performance.\nWe may not pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the future.\nDeclaration and payment of any dividend on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. The timing and amount of dividend payments will be dependent upon factors such as our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, and restrictions in our credit facilities. Accordingly, it is likely that investors may have to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume may decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market and interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and may also impair our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers.\nFuture sales and issuances of our securities could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing shareholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing shareholders.", "PERMNO": 15394, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "MJCO"}
