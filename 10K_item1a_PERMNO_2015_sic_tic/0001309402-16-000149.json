{"cik": "1309402", "company": "Green Plains Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe operate in an industry that has numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control or are driven by factors that cannot always be predicted. Investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors in conjunction with the other information included in this report as our financial results and condition or market value could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to occur.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur profitability is dependent on managing the spread between the price of corn, natural gas, ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil.\nOur ethanol production results are highly sensitive to commodity prices, including the spread between the corn and natural gas we purchase, and the ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil we sell. Price and supply are subject to market forces, such as weather, domestic and global demand, shortages, export prices, crude oil prices, currency valuations and government policies in the United States and around the world, over which we have no control. Price volatility of these commodities may cause our operating results to fluctuate substantially. Increases in corn or natural gas prices or decreases in ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil prices may make it unprofitable to operate our plants. No assurance can be given that we will purchase corn and natural gas or sell ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil at or near current prices. Consequently, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by increases in corn or natural gas prices or decreases in ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil prices.\nWe continuously monitor the profitability of our ethanol plants using a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies, when appropriate. In recent years, the spread between ethanol and corn prices has fluctuated widely and narrowed significantly. Fluctuations are likely to continue. A sustained narrow spread or further reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices as a result of increased corn prices or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Should our combined revenue from ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil fall below our cost of production, we could decide to slow or suspend production at some or all of our plants.\nThe commodities we buy and sell are subject to price volatility and uncertainty.\nCorn. We are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to our customers since ethanol competes with other fuels. At certain corn prices, ethanol may be uneconomical to produce. Ethanol plants, livestock industries and other corn-consuming enterprises put significant price pressure on local corn markets. In addition, local corn supplies and prices could be adversely affected by prices for alternative crops, increasing input costs, changes in government policies, shifts in global markets or damaging growing conditions, such as plant disease or adverse weather, including drought.\nNatural Gas. The price and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions are often affected by factors beyond our control, such as weather, overall economic conditions and government regulations. Significant disruptions in natural gas supply could impair our ability to produce ethanol. Furthermore, increases in natural gas price or changes in our cost relative to our competitors may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nEthanol. Our revenues are dependent on market prices for ethanol which can be volatile as a result of a number of factors, including: the price and availability of competing fuels; the overall supply and demand for ethanol and corn; the price of gasoline, crude oil and corn; and government policies. The low margin environment for 2015 was impacted by the energy market which saw historic low crude oil prices as world supply reached record levels.\nEthanol is marketed as a fuel additive that reduces vehicle emissions, an economical source of octanes and, to a lesser extent, a gasoline substitute. Consequently, gasoline supply and demand affect the price of ethanol. Should gasoline prices or demand decrease significantly, our results of operations could be materially harmed.\nEthanol imports also affect domestic supply and demand. Imported ethanol is not subject to an import tariff and, under RFS II, sugarcane ethanol from Brazil is one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet the advanced biofuel standard.\nDistillers Grains. Increased U.S. dry mill ethanol production has resulted in increased distillers grains production. Should this trend continue, distillers grains prices could fall unless demand increases or other market sources are found. The price of distillers grains has historically been correlated with the price of corn. Occasionally, the price of distillers grains will\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nlag behind fluctuations in corn or other feedstock prices, lowering our cost recovery percentage.\nDistillers grains compete with other protein-based animal feed products. Downward pressure on commodity prices, such as soybeans, will generally cause the price of competing animal feed products to decline, resulting in downward pressure on the price of distillers grains.\nCorn Oil. Industrial corn oil is generally marketed as a biodiesel feedstock; therefore, the price of corn oil is affected by demand for biodiesel. In general, corn oil prices follow the prices of heating oil and soybean oil. Decreases in the price of corn oil could have an unfavorable impact on our business.\nOur risk management strategies could be ineffective and expose us to decreased liquidity.\nAs market conditions warrant, we use forward contracts to sell some of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil production or buy some of the corn or natural gas we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas and ethanol. The financial impact of these activities depends on the price of the commodities involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities.\nHedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying and physical commodity changes. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. We vary the amount of hedging and other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all. We cannot provide assurance that our risk management strategies effectively offset commodity price volatility. If we fail to offset such volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nThe use of derivative financial instruments frequently involves cash deposits with brokers, or margin calls. Sudden changes in commodity prices may require additional cash deposits immediately. Depending on our open derivative positions, we may need additional liquidity with little advance notice to cover margin calls. While we continuously monitor our exposure to margin calls, we cannot guarantee we will be able to maintain adequate liquidity to cover margin calls in the future.\nGovernment mandates affecting ethanol usage could change and impact the ethanol market.\nUnder the provisions of the EISA, the EPA established a mandate setting the minimum volume of ethanol that must be blended with gasoline under the RFS II, which affects the domestic market for ethanol. The EPA has the authority to waive the requirements, in whole or in part, if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or the environment.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by legislation that reduces the RFS II mandate. Such legislation has been introduced in Congress, including the Renewable Fuel Standard Elimination Act, RFS Reform Bill and Domestic Alternatives Fuels Act; however, these bills failed to make it out of congressional committee and were not enacted into law. Similarly, should federal mandates regarding oxygenated gasoline be repealed, the market for domestic ethanol could diminish.\nFuture demand will be influenced by economic incentives to blend based on the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and the RFS II mandate. A significant increase in supply beyond the RFS II mandate could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Moreover, changes to RFS II which significantly affect the market price of RINs could negatively impact the price of ethanol or cause imported sugarcane ethanol to become more economical than domestic ethanol.\nFlexible-fuel vehicles, which are designed to run on a mixture of fuels such as E85, receive preferential treatment to meet corporate average fuel economy standards. Absent CAFE preferences, auto manufacturers may not be willing to build flexible-fuel vehicles, reducing the growth of E85 markets and resulting in lower ethanol prices.\nTo the extent federal or state laws or regulations are modified, the demand for ethanol may be reduced, which could negatively and materially affect our ability to operate profitably.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFuture demand for ethanol is uncertain and changes in public perception, consumer acceptance and overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.\nEthanol production has not been without controversy. While many trade groups, academics and government agencies support ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others criticize the ethanol industry claiming production consumes considerably more energy, emits more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and depletes water resources. Some studies suggest ethanol produced from corn is less efficient than ethanol produced from switch grass or wheat grain. Others claim corn-based ethanol negatively impacts consumers by causing the prices of dairy, meat and other food derived from corn-consuming livestock to increase. Ethanol critics also contend the industry redirects corn supplies from international food markets to domestic fuel markets.\nIf negative views of corn-based ethanol production persist and gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting domestic production and its use could decline and lead to reduction or repeal of federal mandates, which could adversely affect ethanol demand. These views could also have a negative impact on public perception and overall acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.\nThere are limited markets for ethanol beyond the federal mandates. Consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuels may be necessary before ethanol can achieve significant market share growth. Discretionary and E85 blending are important secondary markets. Discretionary blending is often determined by the price of ethanol relative to gasoline. When discretionary blending is financially unattractive, the demand for ethanol may be reduced. Demand for ethanol is also affected by overall demand for transportation fuel, which is affected by cost, number of miles traveled and vehicle fuel economy. Reduced demand for ethanol may depress the value of our products, erode our margins, and reduce our ability to generate revenue or operate profitably.\nIncreased federal support of cellulosic ethanol could result in increased competition to corn-based ethanol producers.\nRecent legislation, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA, provides numerous funding opportunities to support cellulosic ethanol production. In addition, RFS II mandates an increasing level of biofuel production that is not derived from corn. Federal policies suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processing using feedstocks such as switch grass, silage, wood chips or other forms of biomass. Cellulosic ethanol may be viewed more favorably since the feedstock is not likely diverted from food production. In addition, cellulosic ethanol may have a smaller carbon footprint because the feedstock does not require energy-intensive fertilizers or industrial production processes. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are currently under development. As research and development programs persist, there is risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol.\nAny changes in federal mandates from corn-based to cellulosic-based ethanol production may reduce our profitability. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities and would require significant additional investments to convert production to cellulosic ethanol. Furthermore, our plants are strategically located in high-yield, low-cost corn production areas. At present, there is limited supply of alternative feedstocks near our facilities. As a result, the adoption of cellulosic ethanol and its use as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to maintain the required regulatory permits or manage changes in environmental and safety regulations is essential to successfully operating our plants.\nOur ethanol production and agribusiness segments are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds, which requires numerous environmental permits to operate our plants. Governing state agencies could impose costly conditions or restrictions that are detrimental to our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations at the federal and state level are subject to change. These changes can also be made retroactively. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. Consequently, even though we currently have the proper permits, we may be required to invest or spend considerable resources in order to comply with future environmental regulations. Furthermore, ongoing plant operations, which are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, may change in a way that increases the cost of plant operations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPart of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Since we handle and use hazardous substances, changes in environmental requirements or an unanticipated significant adverse environmental event could have a negative impact on our business. While we strive to comply with all environmental requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we have been in compliance at all times or will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Private parties, including current and former employees, could bring personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of hazardous substances. We are also exposed to residual risk by our land and facilities which may have environmental liabilities from prior use. Changes in environmental regulations may require us to modify existing plant and processing facilities, which could significantly increase our cost of operations.\nThe distillers grains that we produce as part of the ethanol production process are used as feed for animals. Should the regulations under the FSMA regarding preventive controls for animal food apply to us, we may need additional resources to comply with the newly established requirements.\nAny inability to generate or obtain RINs could adversely affect our operating margins.\nNearly all of our ethanol production is sold with RINs that are used by our customers to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Should our production not meet the EPA\u2019s requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would need to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at lower prices to compensate for the absence of RINs. The price of RINs depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of qualifying biofuels and RINs for purchase, production levels of transportation fuel and percentage mix of ethanol with other fuels, and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINs or reliance on invalid RINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe trade ethanol and associated RINs acquired from third-parties. Should it be discovered the associated RINs we purchased were invalid, albeit unknowingly, we could be subject to substantial penalties if we are assessed the maximum amount allowed by law. Prior to 2013, the EPA assessed only modest penalties for RIN violations; however, with the industry now on notice of the possibility of invalid RINs, the EPA could assess much higher penalties going forward, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nCompliance with evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, particularly those related to climate change, could be costly.\nOur plants emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of ethanol production. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on RFS II, grandfathering our plants at their current authorized capacity. Expansion above these levels will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2005 baseline measurement. Separately, CARB adopted a LCFS that took effect in January 2013, which requires a 10% reduction in the average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. An ILUC component is included in the greenhouse gas emission calculation, which may have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California.\nTo expand our production capacity, federal and state regulations may require us to obtain additional permits, achieve EPA\u2019s efficient producer status under the pathway petition program, install advanced technology or reduce drying distillers grains. Compliance with future laws or regulations to decrease carbon dioxide could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have an adverse impact on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nGlobal competition could affect our profitability.\nWe compete with producers in the United States and abroad. Depending on feedstock, labor and other production costs, producers in other countries, such as Brazil, may be able to produce ethanol cheaper than we can. Under RFS II, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet this standard. While transportation costs, infrastructure constraints and demand may temper the impact of ethanol imports, foreign competition remains a risk to our business. Moreover, significant additional foreign ethanol production could create excess supply, which could result in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. Any penetration of ethanol imports into the domestic market may have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIncreased ethanol industry penetration by oil and other multinational companies could impact our margins.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment. The ethanol industry consists primarily of smaller entities engaged exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol in addition to their base grain businesses. We compete for capital, labor, corn and other resources with these companies.\nUntil recently, oil companies, petrochemical refiners and gasoline retailers were not engaged in ethanol production even though they form the primary distribution network for ethanol blended with gasoline. During the past five years, several large oil companies have started producing ethanol. If these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or additional companies commence production, the need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like us could diminish and adversely effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nSales of distillers grains depend on its continued market acceptance as livestock feed.\nAntibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination; therefore, it is possible for antibiotics to be present in small quantities in our distillers grains, which is a co-product of the fermentation process and marketed as an animal feed. The FDA has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards using distillers grains with antibiotic residue as an animal feed. Should the FDA introduce regulations limiting the sale of such distillers grains in domestic or international markets, the market value of our distillers grains could be diminished, which would negatively impact our profitability.\nIndependently, if public perception regarding distillers grains as an acceptable animal feed were to change or if the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply, the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nWe extract industrial grade corn oil from the whole stillage process before producing distillers grains. Several universities are trying to determine how corn oil extraction affects nutritional energy values of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that corn oil extraction adversely affects the digestible energy content of distillers grains, the value of our distillers grains may be affected, which could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nInternational activities such as boycotts, embargoes, product rejection, and compliance matters, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn 2010, the market share of U.S. ethanol exports to the EU began to increase significantly while the market share of European ethanol production began to modestly decline. In October 2011, the European Commission initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. In 2013, the EU imposed a five-year tariff of $83.33 per metric ton on U.S. ethanol to discourage foreign competition.\nSince 2010, approximately 25% of distillers grains produced in the United States have been exported. China has been the largest importer of distillers grains in the world, importing approximately 50% of the world exports in 2015. In 2013, China began rejecting U.S. dried distillers grains because it contained genetically modified corn not yet approved for import. In early 2015, China lifted this ban, allowing distillers grains into their country. In January 2016, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce once again initiated an anti-dumping investigation into U.S.-produced dried distillers grains exported to China. Should the investigation result in additional findings, the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted in the future and may affect our profitability.\nOur agribusiness operations are subject to significant government and private sector regulations.\nOur agribusiness operations are regulated by government and private sector associations that can impose significant costs on our business. Failure to comply could result in additional expenditures, fines or criminal action. Our production levels, markets and grains we merchandise are affected by federal government programs, which include USDA acreage control and price support programs. Government policies such as tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and embargos can also impact our business. Changes in government policies and producer support could impact the type and amount of grains planted, which could affect our ability to buy grain. Export restrictions or tariffs could limit sales opportunities outside of the United States.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur agribusiness segment is affected by the supply and demand for grain, and is sensitive to factors that are often outside of our control.\nWithin our agribusiness segment, we compete with grain merchandisers, processors and end-users to buy grain, and grain merchandisers, private elevator operators and cooperatives to sell it. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than us and compete in more diverse markets. Failure to compete effectively would impact our profitability.\nFixed-price purchase obligations and grain inventories expose us to market price risk between the time of purchase and final sale. Weather, economic, political, environmental and technological conditions and developments, as well as other factors beyond our control, local and worldwide, can affect supply, demand and consequently, the value of our inventories held for sale and adversely affect profitability of the agribusiness segment.\nWe hedge the majority of our grain inventory with derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with commodity price changes. However, we are unable to hedge all of the risk due to timing, availability of hedge contract counterparties and third-party credit risk. Furthermore, it is possible that the derivatives we employ are not effective in offsetting price changes. This can happen when the derivative and the hedged item are not perfectly matched. Our grain derivatives, for example, do not hedge the basis component, or the difference between the cash price at one of our grain facilities and the soonest exchange-traded futures price, of our grain inventory and contracts. Although the basis component is smaller and generally less volatile than the futures component of grain market prices, significant unfavorable movement in basis on grain positions as large as ours may significantly impact our profitability.\nCommodities futures trading is subject to extensive regulations.\nThe futures industry is subject to extensive regulation. Since we use exchange-traded futures contracts as part of our business, we are required to comply with a wide range of requirements imposed by the CFTC, National Futures Association and the exchanges on which we trade. These regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the futures markets and protecting the interests of market participants. As a market participant, we may be subject to regulation concerning trade practices, business conduct, reporting, position limits, record retention, the conduct of our officers and employees, and other matters.\nFailure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations applicable to futures trading could have adverse consequences. It is possible for us, an officer or one of our employees to be subject to claims arising from acts that regulators assert violated these laws, rules or regulations. Such claims could result in fines, settlements or suspended trading privileges, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOwning and operating a cattle feedlot operation involves numerous external factors that are outside of our control.\nOur cattle feedlot operation involves numerous risks that could lead to increased costs or decreased demand for beef products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u00b7\nconstantly changing and potentially volatile supply and demand, which affect the cost of livestock and feed ingredients and the sales price of our cattle;\n\u00b7\noutbreak of disease in our feedlot or public perception that an outbreak has occurred, which could lead to inadequate supply, reduced consumer confidence in the safety and quality of beef products, adverse publicity, cancellation of orders and import or export restrictions;\n\u00b7\ncontamination or allegations of contamination of our products or our competitors\u2019 products, which could subject us to product liability claims or product recalls;\n\u00b7\nliabilities in excess of our insurance policy limits or related uninsurable risks if outbreaks of disease or other conditions result in significant losses;\n\u00b7\ninability to attract sufficient customers to maximize operational efficiencies;\n\u00b7\nloss of one or more major customers, a substantial decline in customer orders or a significant decrease in beef prices for a sustained period of time;\n\u00b7\ncustomer defaults on cattle, feed or other input financing;\n\u00b7\ndiminished access to international markets, including import trade restrictions due to disease or other perceived health or food safety issues, or changes in political or economic conditions;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nreduced red meat consumption due to dietary changes or other issues, leading to depressed cattle prices;\n\u00b7\nincreased water costs due to water use restrictions, including those related to diminishing water table levels;\n\u00b7\noperational restrictions resulting from government regulations; and\n\u00b7\nrisks relating to environmental hazards.\nOur debt exposes us to numerous risks that could have significant consequences to our shareholders.\nRisks related to the level of debt we have include:\n\u00b7\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash to be dedicated for debt payments, reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u00b7\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash reserves to be held for debt service, limiting our ability to invest in new growth opportunities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other activities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nbeing at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors;\n\u00b7\nbeing vulnerable to increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u00b7\nsubjecting all or substantially all of our assets to liens, which means there may be no assets left for shareholders in the event of a liquidation; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to make operational decisions regarding our business, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, make capital improvements, sell or purchase assets or engage in transactions deemed appropriate and in our best interest.\nMost of our debt bears interest at variable rates, which creates exposure to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations at variable rates would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, decreasing net income.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest, to make additional payments required under financial covenants, or to refinance our debt depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue generating cash flow sufficient to service our debt because of such factors, including the spread between corn prices and ethanol, corn oil and distillers grains prices. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows, we may be required to sell assets, restructure debt or obtain additional equity capital on terms that are onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our debt will depend on capital markets and our financial condition at that time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in default on our debt obligations.\nWe are not restricted from incurring additional debt, pledging assets, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments.\nWe are required to comply with a number of covenants under our existing loan agreements that could hinder our growth.\nThe loan agreements governing our secured debt financing and the 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2018 contain a number of restrictive affirmative and negative covenants, which limit our ability to incur additional debt; exceed certain limits; pay dividends or distributions; or merge, consolidate or dispose of substantially all of our assets.\nWe are required to maintain specified financial ratios, including minimum cash flow coverage, working capital and tangible net worth under certain loan agreements. Other agreements require us to use a portion of excess cash flow generated by our operations to prepay the respective term debt. A breach of these covenants could result in default, and if such default is not cured or waived, our lenders could accelerate our debt and declare it immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt. Even if financing is available, it may not be on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nacceptable terms. No assurance can be given that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants or remedy default.\nIn the past, we have received waivers from our lenders for failure to meet certain financial covenants and amended our loan agreements to change these covenants. In the event we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amend our loan agreements to prevent default. Under our 3.25% convertible senior notes, default on any loan in excess of $10.0 million could result in the notes being declared due and payable.\nWe operate in a capital intensive business and rely on cash generated from operations and external financing, which could be limited.\nSome ethanol producers have faced financial distress, culminating to bankruptcy filings by several companies over the past seven years. This, combined with capital market volatility, has resulted in reduced available capital for the ethanol industry in general. The majority of our ethanol plants\u2019 operations and related levels of working capital are funded by long-term credit facilities. Increased commodity prices could increase liquidity requirements. Our operating cash flow is dependent on overall commodity market conditions as well as our ability to operate profitably. In addition, we may need to raise additional financing to fund growth. In some market environments, we may have limited access to incremental financing, which could defer or cancel growth projects, reduce business activity or cause us to default on our existing debt agreements if we are unable to meet our payment schedules. These events could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 debt facilities have ongoing payment requirements that we generally expect to meet from their operating cash flow. Our ability to repay current and anticipated future debt will depend on our financial and operating performance and successful implementation of our business strategies. Our financial and operational performance will depend on numerous factors including prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot repay, refinance or extend our current debt at scheduled maturity dates, we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure our debt or seek additional capital. If we are unable to restructure our debt or raise funds, our operations could be harmed and the value of our stock could be significantly reduced.\nWe have limitations, as a holding company, in our ability to receive distributions from our subsidiaries.\nWe conduct most of our operations through our subsidiaries and rely on dividends or intercompany transfers of funds to generate free cash flow. Some of our subsidiaries are currently, or are expected to be, limited in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of their financing agreements. Consequently, we cannot rely on the cash flow from one subsidiary to satisfy the loan obligations of another subsidiary. As a result, if a subsidiary is unable to satisfy its loan obligations, we may not be able to prevent default by providing additional cash to that subsidiary, even if sufficient cash exists elsewhere within our organization.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage our growing and changing operations.\nSince our formation in 2004, our business has grown significantly in size and complexity. This growth places substantial demands on our management, systems, internal controls, and financial and physical resources. If we acquire additional operations, we may need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems, and could incur expenses related to hiring additional qualified personnel and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our ability to manage growth effectively could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.\nWe have increased the size of our operations significantly through mergers and acquisitions and intend to continue exploring potential growth opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel and realizing anticipated synergies of the combined business;\n\u00b7\nrisks relating to environmental hazards on purchased sites;\n\u00b7\nrisks relating to developing the necessary infrastructure for facilities or acquired sites, including access to rail networks;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties supporting and transitioning customers;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u00b7\nthe purchase price exceeding the value realized;\n\u00b7\nrisks of entering new markets or areas outside of our core competencies;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from our existing or acquired business;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated problems or underlying liabilities; and\n\u00b7\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition and development costs.\nThe anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized or take longer to realize than expected.\nWe may also pursue growth through joint ventures or partnerships, which typically involve restrictions on actions that the partnership or joint venture may take without the approval of the partners. These provisions could limit our ability to manage the partnership or joint venture in a manner that serves our best interests.\nFuture acquisitions may involve issuing equity as payment or to finance the business or assets, which could dilute your ownership interest. Furthermore, additional debt may be necessary to complete these transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Failure to adequately address the risks associated with acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our joint venture to commercialize algae production.\nWe own a majority of a joint venture that is focused on developing technology to grow and harvest algae in commercially viable quantities. The algae we produce have the potential to be used for high-quality feedstocks for human nutrition, pharmaceutical applications, animal feed and biofuels. Our primary focus is to grow algae efficiently on a large scale and further develop markets for algae. We believe this technology has specific applications for our ethanol plants that emit carbon dioxide. If we are unable to achieve acceptable production rates, operating costs, capital requirements and product market prices, we could fail to realize any benefit from capturing carbon dioxide to grow and harvest algae.\nWe depend on a continuous supply of energy and water to operate our plants.\nOur plants require a substantial, uninterrupted supply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We rely on third parties to provide these resources. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to secure an adequate supply of energy or water to support current or expected plant operations. If there is an interruption in the supply any reason, we may be required to halt production. Halting production for an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nReplacement technologies could make corn-based ethanol or our process technology obsolete.\nEthanol is used primarily as an additive and oxygenate blended with gasoline. Critics of ethanol blends argue that it decreases fuel economy, causes corrosion and damages fuel pumps. Prior to federal restrictions and ethanol mandates, methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, was the leading oxygenate. Other ether products could enter the market and prove to be environmentally or economically superior to ethanol. Alternative biofuel alcohols, such as methanol and butanol, could evolve and replace ethanol.\nResearch is currently underway to develop products that have advantages over ethanol, such as: lower vapor pressure, making it easier to add to gasoline; similar energy content as gasoline, reducing any decrease in fuel economy caused by blending with gasoline; ability to blend at higher concentration levels in standard vehicles; and reduced susceptibility to separation when water is present. Products offering a competitive advantage over ethanol could reduce our ability to generate revenue and profits from ethanol production.\nNew ethanol process technologies could emerge that require less energy per gallon to produce and result in lower production costs. Our process technologies could become obsolete and place us at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be required to provide remedies for ethanol, distillers grains or corn oil that does not meet the specifications defined in our sales contracts.\nIf we produce or purchase ethanol, distillers grains or corn oil that does not meet the specifications defined in our sales contracts, we may be subject to quality claims. We could be required to refund the purchase price of any non-conforming product or replace the non-conforming product at our expense. Ethanol, distillers grains or corn oil that we purchase or market and subsequently sell to others could result in similar claims if the product does not meet applicable contract specifications, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe are exposed to credit risk that could result in losses or affect our ability to make payments should a counterparty fail to perform according to the terms of our agreement.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from a variety of customers, including major integrated oil companies, large independent refiners, petroleum wholesalers, commercial grain buyers and other ethanol plants. We are also exposed to credit risk with major suppliers of petroleum products and agricultural inputs when we make payments for undelivered inventories. Our fixed-price forward contracts are subject to credit risk when prices change significantly prior to delivery. The inability by a third party to pay us for our sales, provide product that was paid for in advance or deliver on a fixed-price contract could result in a loss and adversely impact our liquidity and ability to make our own payments when due.\nWe may incur a loss should our counterparty fail to perform under a third-party marketing agreement.\nUnder a third-party marketing agreement, we purchase their ethanol production and sell it in various markets for future deliveries. Under the terms of the agreement, the third-party is not obligated to produce a minimum volume, therefore, we may not receive the full amount of ethanol the third-party plant is expected to produce. Any interruption or curtailment of production could force us to purchase ethanol at higher prices to meet contractual obligations. Recoveries would be dependent on the third party\u2019s ability to pay, and in the event they were unable to pay, our profitability could be materially and adversely impacted.\nBusiness disruptions due to unforeseen operational failures or factors outside of our control could impact our ability to fulfill contractual obligations.\nNatural disasters, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment or strikes by our transportation providers could delay shipments of raw materials to our plants or deliveries of ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Unforeseen operational issues due to faulty construction design or other factors could result in an extended facility shutdown. If we are unable to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements due to stalled operations caused by business disruptions, we could potentially lose customers.\nAdverse weather conditions, such as inadequate or excessive amounts of rain during the growing season, overly wet conditions, an early freeze or snowy weather during harvest could impact the supply of corn that is needed to produce ethanol. Corn stored in an open pile may be damaged by rain or warm weather before the corn is dried, shipped or moved into a storage structure.\nWe may not have adequate insurance to cover losses from certain events.\nLosses related to risks that are not covered by insurance or available under acceptable terms such as war, riots or terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur Obion, Tennessee plant and certain fuel terminals are located within a recognized seismic zone. We modified our Obion facility to comply with regional structural requirements and obtained additional insurance coverage specific to earthquake risk for this particular plant and these fuel terminals. We cannot provide assurance that these facilities would remain in operation should a seismic event occur.\nOur ethanol-related assets may be at greater risk of terrorist attacks, threats of war or actual war, than other possible targets.\nTerrorist attacks in the United States, including threats of war or actual war, may adversely affect our operations. We believe energy-related assets are at greater risk than other possible targets due to the level of disruption it could cause. A direct attack on our ethanol production plants, storage facilities, fuel terminals and railcars could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, a terrorist attack could have an adverse\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nimpact on ethanol prices. Disruption or significant increases in ethanol prices could result in government-imposed price controls.\nOur network infrastructure, enterprise applications and internal technology systems could be damaged or otherwise fail and disrupt business activities.\nOur network infrastructure, enterprise applications and internal technology systems are instrumental to the day-to-day operations of our business. Numerous factors outside of our control, including earthquakes, floods, lightning, tornados, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic vandalism or similar disruptions could result in system failures, interruptions or loss of critical data and prevent us from fulfilling customer orders. We cannot provide assurance that our backup systems are sufficient to mitigate hardware or software failures, which could result in business disruptions that negatively impact our operating results and damage our reputation.\nWe could be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, data security breaches and significant information technology systems interruptions.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyber-attacks and data security breaches. To manage the risk associated with potential technology security breaches, we have implemented disaster recovery plans for our critical systems and security measures to protect us against cyber-based attacks. However, our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack at any time and there can be no assurances that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans are sufficient to prevent a technology systems breach, systems failure, business interruption or loss of sensitive data. The potential impact of any of these incidents, should they occur, could be material and have an adverse impact to our revenues, operating results, financial condition or damage our reputation.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain competent employees. Qualified managers, engineers, merchandisers and other personnel must be hired for each of our locations and competition for suitable candidates in the ethanol industry can be intense. If we are unable to hire and retain productive, skilled personnel, we may not be able to maximize ethanol production, optimize plant operations or execute our business strategy.\nDisruptions in the credit market or a downgrade in our credit rating could limit our access to capital.\nWe may need additional capital to fund our growth or other business activities in the future. If our credit rating is downgraded, the cost of capital under our existing or future financing arrangements could increase and affect our ability to trade with various commercial counterparties or cause our counterparties to require additional forms of credit support. If capital markets are disrupted, we may not be able to access capital at all or capital may only be available under less favorable terms.\nWe have had a history of operating losses and could incur future operating losses.\nWe incurred operating losses in 2006, 2007, 2008 and during certain quarters of 2012 and 2015, and could incur operating losses in the future that are substantial. Although we have had periods of sustained profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, which could impact the market price of our common stock and the value of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Partnership\nWe depend on the partnership to provide fuel storage and transportation services.\nThe partnership\u2019s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the storage and transportation of fuel, including: damages to storage facilities, railcars and surrounding properties caused by floods, fires, severe weather, explosions, natural disasters or acts of terrorism; mechanical or structural failures at the partnership\u2019s facilities or at third-party facilities at which its operations are dependent; curtailments of operations relative to severe weather; and other hazards, resulting in severe damage or destruction of the partnership\u2019s assets or temporary or permanent shut-down of the partnership\u2019s facilities. If the partnership is unable to serve our storage and transportation needs, our ability to operate our business could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The inability of the partnership to continue operations, for any reason, could also impact the value of our investment in the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npartnership and, because the partnership is a consolidated entity, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe partnership may not have sufficient available cash to pay quarterly distributions on its units.\nThe amount of cash the partnership can distribute depends on how much cash is generated from operations, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on ethanol and other fuel volumes, handling fees, payments associated with minimum volume commitments, timely payments by subsidiaries and other third parties, and prevailing economic conditions. The amount of cash available for distribution also depends on the partnership\u2019s operating and general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and organic growth projects, debt service requirements, working capital needs, ability to borrow funds and access capital markets, revolving credit facility restrictions, cash reserves and other risks affecting cash levels. Increasing the partnership\u2019s borrowings or other debt to finance its growth strategy could increase interest expense, which could impact the amount of cash available for distributions.\nThere are no limitations in the partnership agreement regarding its ability to issue additional units. Should the partnership issue additional units in connection with an acquisition or expansion, the distributions on the incremental units will increase the risk that the partnership will be unable to maintain or increase distributions on a per unit basis.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact the partnership\u2019s unit price, ability to issue equity or incur debt, and pay cash distributions at intended levels.\nThe partnership\u2019s cash distributions and implied distribution yield affect its unit price. Distributions are often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities when making investment decisions. A rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the partnership\u2019s unit price, ability to issue equity or incur debt or pay cash distributions at intended levels, which could adversely impact the value of our investment in the partnership.\nWe may be required to pay taxes on our share of the partnership\u2019s income that are greater than the cash distributions we receive from the partnership.\nThe unitholders of the partnership generally include, for purposes of calculating their U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, their share of the partnership\u2019s taxable income, whether they have received cash distributions from the partnership. We ultimately may not receive cash distributions from the partnership equal to our share of taxable income or the taxes that are due with respect to that income.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of owning and operating a publicly traded partnership.\nWe expect to incur an estimated $2.0 million of incremental costs each year associated with the partnership being publicly traded. It is possible, however, that the actual costs will be higher than currently estimated. Some of the costs include increased legal and financial expenses related to complying with SEC and Nasdaq requirements. The partnership is required to have at least three independent directors, create an audit committee and adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures within one year of its initial listing on Nasdaq. We will also incur additional costs associated with officer liability insurance under a separate policy from our corporate director and officer insurance.\nAll of the executive officers and a majority of the initial directors of the partnership are also officers of Green Plains Inc., which could result in conflicts of interest.\nWe indirectly own and control the partnership and appoint all of its officers and directors. All of the executive officers and a majority of the initial directors of the partnership are also an officer or director. Although our directors and officers have a fiduciary responsibility to manage the company in a manner that is beneficial to us, as directors and officers of the partnership, they also have certain duties to the partnership and its unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and our affiliates, and the partnership and its unitholders, and in resolving these conflicts, the partnership may favor its own interests over the company\u2019s interests. In certain circumstances, the partnership may refer conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest to its conflicts committee, which must consist entirely of independent directors, for resolution. The conflicts committee must act in the best interests of the public unitholders of the partnership. As a result, the partnership may manage its business in a manner that differs from the best interests of the company or our stockholders.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCash available for distributions could be reduced and likely cause a substantial reduction in unit value if the partnership became subject to entity-level taxation for federal income tax purposes.\nThe present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or investments in its units could be modified, at any time, by administrative, legislative or judicial changes and interpretations. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Should any legislative proposal eliminate the qualifying income exception, all publicly traded partnerships would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes. The partnership would be required to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate and likely state and local income taxes at varying rates as well. Distributions to unitholders would be taxed as corporate distributions. The partnership\u2019s cash available for distributions and the value of the units would be substantially reduced.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to factors beyond our control.\nSome of the many factors that can influence the price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\nour results of operations and the performance of our competitors;\n\u00b7\npublic\u2019s reaction to our press releases, public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by equity research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in general economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market prices for our products or raw materials and related substitutes;\n\u00b7\nsales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders;\n\u00b7\nactions by institutional investors trading in our stock;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our operations;\n\u00b7\nany major change in our management team;\n\u00b7\nother developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors; and\n\u00b7\nU.S. and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nIn recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which are sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company. These broad market fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock price based on factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nOur restated articles of incorporation, restated bylaws and Iowa\u2019s law contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent change in control of us or our management. These provisions discourage proxy contests, making it difficult for our shareholders to elect directors or take other corporate actions without the consent of our board of directors, which include:\n\u00b7\nboard of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u00b7\nboard members can only be removed for cause with an affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares;\n\u00b7\nshareholder action can only be taken at a special or annual meeting, not by written consent except where required by Iowa law;\n\u00b7\nshareholders are restricted from making proposals at shareholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nthe board of directors can issue authorized or unissued shares of stock.\nWe are subject to the provisions of the Iowa Business Corporations Act, which prohibits combinations between an Iowa\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncorporation whose stock is publicly traded or held by more than 2,000 shareholders and an interested shareholder for three years unless certain exemption requirements are met.\nProvisions in the convertible notes could also make it more difficult or too expensive for a third party to acquire us. If a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. If a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes. In either case, the obligation under the notes could increase the acquisition cost and discourage a third party from acquiring us.\nThese items discourage transactions that could otherwise command a premium over prevailing market prices and may limit the price investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nNon-U.S. shareholders may be subject to U.S. income tax on gains related to the sale of their common stock.\nIf we are a U.S. real property holding corporation during the shorter of the five-year period before the stock was sold or the period the stock was held by a non-U.S. shareholder, the non-U.S. shareholder could be subject to U.S federal income tax on gains related to the sale of their common stock. Whether we are a U.S. real property holding corporation depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests relative to our other trade or business assets and non-U.S. real property interests. We cannot provide assurance that we are not a U.S. real property holding corporation or will not become one in the future.", "PERMNO": 91161, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "GPRE"}
