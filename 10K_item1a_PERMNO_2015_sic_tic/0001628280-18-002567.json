{"cik": "850141", "company": "HORACE MANN EDUCATORS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect the Company's business, financial results and results of operations. In addition, refer to the risk factors disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-looking Information of this report for certain important factors that may cause our financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from current expectations. The risks that the Company has highlighted in these two sections of this report are not the only ones that the Company faces.\nThe Company's business involves various risks and uncertainties which are based on the lines of business the Company writes as well as more global risks associated with the general business and insurance industry environments.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions, Market Conditions and Investments\nVolatile financial markets and adverse economic environments can impact financial market risk as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere can experience extreme volatility and disruption for uncertain periods of time. During such times, stresses affecting the global banking system can lead to economic volatility which can exert significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and many other investment asset classes and result in substantially increased market volatility, severely constrained credit and capital markets, particularly for financial institutions, and an overall loss of investor confidence. Many states and local governments can also be impacted by adverse economic conditions which could have an impact on both the Company's niche market and its investment portfolio. Like other financial\ninstitutions which face significant financial market risk in their operations, the Company was adversely affected by these conditions and could be adversely impacted by similar circumstances in the future. The Company's ability to access the capital markets to refinance outstanding indebtedness or raise capital could be impaired during significant financial market disruptions.\nAs discussed further in subsequent risk factors, in addition to the effects of financial markets volatility, a prolonged economic recession may have other adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our investment strategy is not successful, we could suffer unexpected losses.\nThe success of our investment strategy is crucial to the success of our business. Specifically, our fixed maturity securities portfolio is subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022\ninterest rate risk, which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than expected;\n\u2022\nmarket value risk, which is the risk that our invested assets will decrease in value due to a change in the yields realized on our assets and prevailing market yields for similar assets, an unfavorable change in the liquidity of the investment or an unfavorable change in the financial prospects or a downgrade in the credit rating of the issuer of the investment;\n\u2022\ncredit risk, which is the risk that the value of certain investments becomes impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments or the deterioration in performance or credit quality of the underlying collateral of certain structured securities and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer or underlying credit;\n\u2022\nmarket fundamentals risk, which is the risk that there are changes in the market that can have an unfavorable impact on securities valuation such as availability of credit in the capital markets, re-pricing of credit risk, reduced market liquidity due to broker-dealers' unwillingness to hold inventory, and increased market volatility;\n\u2022\nconcentration risk, which is the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of deterioration in the financial condition of those issuers or the market value of their securities;\n\u2022\nliquidity risk, which is the risk that liabilities are surrendered or mature sooner than anticipated requiring us to sell assets at an undesirable time to provide for policyholder surrenders, withdrawals or claims; and\n\u2022\nregulatory risk, which is the risk that regulatory bodies or governments, in the U.S. or in other countries, may make substantial investments or take significant ownership positions in, or ultimately nationalize, financial institutions or other issuers of securities held in the Company's investment portfolio, which could adversely impact the seniority or contractual terms of the securities. Regulatory risk could also come from changes in tax laws or bankruptcy laws that would adversely impact the valuation and/or after tax yields of certain invested assets.\nIn addition to significant steps taken to attempt to mitigate these risks through our investment guidelines, policies and procedures, we also attempt to mitigate these risks through product pricing, product features and the establishment of policy reserves, but we cannot provide assurance that assets will be properly matched to meet anticipated liabilities or that our investments will provide sufficient returns to enable us to satisfy our guaranteed fixed benefit obligations.\nThe Company's investment strategy and guidelines have resulted in an investment portfolio which is comprised primarily of investment grade, fixed maturity securities. Inclusion of alternative investments, although consistent with the Company's overall conservative investment guidelines, could result in some volatility in our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company could enter into foreign currency, interest rate, credit derivative and other hedging transactions in an effort to manage risks, including risks that may be attributable to any new products offered by the Company. For instance, the Company utilizes call options to manage interest crediting risk related to its FIA and IUL products. We cannot provide assurance that we will successfully structure derivatives and hedges so as to effectively manage risks. If our calculations are incorrect, or if we do not properly structure our derivatives or hedges, we may have unexpected losses that may require us to draw on surplus, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company's defined benefit pension plan is frozen, declining financial markets could also cause, and in the past have caused, the value of the investments in this pension plan to decrease, resulting in additional pension expense, a reduction in other comprehensive income and an increase in required contributions to the defined benefit pension plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of the fair value of our fixed maturity and equity securities includes methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, fair value determination may require more subjectivity and management judgment and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments ultimately could be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. The difference between fair value and amortized cost or cost, net of applicable deferred income tax asset or liability and the related impact on deferred policy acquisition costs associated with investment (annuity) contracts and life insurance products with account values, and interest-sensitive life contracts, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity. Decreases in the fair value of our investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEquity method adjustments on certain limited partnership investments may reduce our profitability and/or cause volatility in our reported results of operations.\nWe invest a portion of our invested assets in limited partnership funds, which are accounted for using the equity method. This means that our proportionate share of the changes in fair value of the underlying net asset values are reported in net investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result, the amount of net investment income that we record from these investments can vary substantially from period to period. Recent equity and credit market volatility may reduce net investment income from these types of investments and negatively impact our results of operations.\nAn impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $47.4 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill was recorded when the Company was acquired in 1989 and when HMPCIC was acquired in 1994, in both instances reflecting the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. In 2017, the goodwill balance was evaluated for impairment, as described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, with no impairment charge resulting from such assessment. The evaluation of goodwill considers a number of factors including the impacts of a volatile financial market on earnings, discount rate assumptions, liquidity and the Company's market capitalization. If an evaluation of the Company's fair value or of the Company's operating segments' fair value indicated that all or a portion of the goodwill balance was impaired, the Company would be required to write-off the impaired portion. Such a write-off could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period of the write-off; however, management does not anticipate a material effect on the Company's financial condition.\nRisks Related to Life and Retirement Segments\nA sustained period of low interest rates or interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect the income we derive from the difference between the interest rates we earn on our investments and the interest we pay under our fixed annuity contracts and life insurance products with account values.\nSignificant changes in interest rates expose us to the risk of not earning income or experiencing losses based on the differences between the interest rates earned on our investments and the credited interest rates paid on our outstanding fixed annuity contracts and life insurance products with account values. Significant changes in interest rates may affect:\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain appropriate interest rate spreads over the fixed rates guaranteed in our annuity and life products;\n\u2022\nthe book yield of our investment portfolio; and\n\u2022\nthe unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio and the related after tax effect on our shareholders' equity and total capital.\nBoth rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect the income we derive from our annuity and life products' interest rate spreads. During periods of falling interest rates or a sustained period of low interest rates, our investment earnings will be lower because new investments in fixed maturity securities likely will bear lower interest rates. We may not be able to fully offset the decline in investment earnings with lower crediting rates on our annuity contracts, particularly in a multi-year period of low interest rates. As of the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, new money rates remain at historically low levels. If interest rates do remain low over an extended period of time, it could pressure our net investment income\nby having to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows from the investment portfolio in lower yielding securities.\nDuring periods of rising interest rates, there may be competitive pressure to increase the crediting rates on our annuity contracts. We may not, however, immediately have the ability to acquire investments with interest rates sufficient to offset an increase in crediting rates under our annuity contracts. Although we develop and maintain asset/liability management programs and procedures designed to reduce the volatility of our income when interest rates are rising or falling, changes in interest rates can affect our interest rate spreads.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect our business in other ways. For example, a rapidly changing interest rate environment may result in less competitive crediting rates on certain of our fixed rate products which could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and/or increases in the level of life insurance and annuity product surrenders and withdrawals. New business volume also could be negatively impacted by product or agent compensation changes which we might make to mitigate the income effect of spread compression. Interest rate fluctuations that impact future profits may also impact the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nOur Life and Retirement operations participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations, the purpose of which is to ensure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the Company's obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Variable annuity reserves are also calculated under a variety of interest rate and market rate scenarios. A continuation of the current low interest rate environment could cause the Company to increase statutory reserves as a result of cash flow testing or minimum requirements for variable annuities, which would reduce statutory surplus of the Life insurance subsidiaries and potentially limit the subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to the holding company or write insurance business (as further described in a subsequent risk factor).\nOur Retirement business may be, and in the past has been, adversely affected by volatile or declining financial market conditions.\nConditions in the U.S. and international financial markets affect the sale and profitability of our annuity products. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when financial markets are declining or experiencing a higher than normal level of volatility over an extended period of time. Therefore, weak and/or volatile financial market performance may adversely affect sales of our variable annuity products to potential customers, may cause current customers to withdraw or reduce the amounts invested in our variable annuity products and may reduce the market value of existing customers' investments in our variable annuity products, in turn reducing the amount of variable annuity fee revenues generated. In addition, some of our variable annuity contracts offer guaranteed minimum death benefit features, which provide for a benefit if the contractholder dies and the contract value is less than a specified amount. A decline in the financial markets could cause the contract value to fall below this specified amount, increasing our exposure to losses from variable annuity products featuring guaranteed minimum death benefits. Declining or volatile financial markets that impact future profits may also impact the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nWe may experience volatility in our results of operations and financial condition due to the fair value accounting for derivative instruments.\nAll derivative instruments, including derivative instruments embedded in FIA and IUL products, are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in our results of operations as follows:\n\u2022\nCall options purchased to fund the annual index credits on our FIA and IUL products are carried at fair value. The fair value of the call options is based on the amount of cash expected to be received to settle the call options obtained from the counterparties adjusted for the nonperformance risk of the counterparty. The change in fair value of derivatives includes the gains or losses recognized at expiration of the option term or upon early termination as well as changes in fair value for open positions.\n\u2022\nThe FIA contractual obligations for future annual index credits are treated as a \"series of embedded derivatives\" over the expected lives of the applicable contracts. Increases or decreases in the fair value of embedded derivatives generally correspond to increases or decreases in equity market performance and changes in the interest rates used to discount the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values.\n\u2022\nThe IUL contractual obligations for future index credits are set equal to the fair value of outstanding 12 month derivatives held in support of the applicable contracts.\nIn future periods, the application of fair value accounting for derivatives and embedded derivatives to our FIA and IUL business may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nDeviations from assumptions regarding future market appreciation, interest spreads, business persistency, mortality and morbidity used in calculating life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition expense amounts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe processes of calculating reserves and deferred policy acquisition expenses for our life and annuity businesses involve the use of a number of assumptions, including those related to market appreciation (the rate of growth in market value of the underlying variable annuity subaccounts due to price appreciation), interest spreads (the interest rates expected to be received on investments less the rate of interest credited to contractholders), business persistency (how long a contract stays with the Company), mortality (the relative incidence of death over a given period of time) and morbidity (the relative incidence of disability resulting from disease or physical impairment). We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves and deferred policy acquisition expenses on an aggregate basis and, if future experience is estimated to differ significantly from previous assumptions, adjustments to reserves and deferred policy acquisition expenses may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA reduction or elimination of the tax advantages of annuity and life products and/or a change in the tax benefits of various government-authorized retirement programs, such as 403(b) annuities and individual retirement accounts (IRAs), could make our products less attractive to clients and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant part of our Retirement business involves fixed and variable 403(b) tax-qualified annuities, which are annuities purchased voluntarily by individuals employed by public school systems or other tax-exempt organizations. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that affect the relative tax and other advantages of our life and annuity products to clients or the tax benefits of programs utilized by our customers. As a result of persisting economic conditions, revenue challenges exist at federal, state and local government levels. These challenges could increase the risk of future adverse impacts on current tax-advantaged products or result in notable reforms to educator pension programs. See also Item 1. Business - Regulation - Regulation at Federal Level.\nCurrent federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by the holders of retirement and life insurance products. Taxes, if any, are generally payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within life insurance and non-qualified annuity contracts. Enactment of this legislation, or other tax reform efforts, including a simplified \"flat tax\" income structure with an exemption from taxation for investment income, could result in fewer sales of our life insurance and annuity products.\nRisks Related to Property and Casualty\nCatastrophic events, as well as significant weather events not designated as catastrophes, can have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnderwriting results of property and casualty insurers are subject to weather and other conditions prevailing in an accident year. While one year may be relatively free of major weather or other disasters - not all of which are designated by the insurance industry as a catastrophe, another year may have numerous such events causing results for such a year to be materially worse than for previous years.\nOur Property and Casualty insurance subsidiaries have experienced, and we anticipate that in the future they will continue to experience, catastrophe losses. A catastrophic event, a series of multiple catastrophic events or a series of non-catastrophe severe weather events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries.\nVarious events can cause catastrophes, including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, severe winter weather, wildfires, earthquakes, explosions and terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines, most of the catastrophe-related claims of our insurance subsidiaries are related to property coverages. Our ability to provide accurate estimates of ultimate catastrophe costs is based on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe proximity of the catastrophe occurrence date to the date of our estimate;\n\u2022\npotential inflation of property repair costs in the affected area;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of multiple catastrophes in a geographic area over a relatively short period of time; and\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation which may be filed against the Company by policyholders, state attorneys general and other parties relative to loss coverage disputes and loss settlement payments.\nBased on 2017 direct premiums earned, 57.7% of the total annual premiums for our Property and Casualty business were for policies issued in the ten largest states in which our insurance subsidiaries write property and casualty coverage. Included in this top ten group are certain states which are considered to be more prone to catastrophe occurrences: California, North Carolina, Texas, South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana.\nAs an ongoing practice, we manage our exposure to catastrophes, as well as our exposure to non-catastrophe weather and other property loss risks. Reductions in Property and Casualty business written in catastrophe-prone areas may have a negative impact on near-term business growth and results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through their underwriting strategies and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Nevertheless, reinsurance may prove inadequate under certain circumstances.\nOur Property and Casualty loss reserves may not be adequate.\nOur Property and Casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain loss reserves to provide for their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. If these loss reserves prove inadequate, we will record a loss measured by the amount of the shortfall and, as a result, the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries will be adversely affected, potentially affecting their ability to distribute cash to the Company.\nReserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Reserves represent estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what our insurance subsidiaries expect the ultimate settlement and adjustment of claims will cost, net of salvage and subrogation. Estimates are based on assessments of known facts and circumstances, assumptions related to the ultimate cost to settle such claims, estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, changing judicial theories of liability, and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events, including changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, unpredictability of court decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, risks inherent in major litigation and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Significant reporting lags may exist between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is actually reported. Our insurance subsidiaries adjust their reserve estimates regularly as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, we cannot be certain that the ultimate liability will not exceed amounts reserved, with a resulting adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMany scientists indicate that the world's overall climate is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage, and our results of operations. If an increase in weather events and/or wildfires were to occur, in addition to the attendant increase in claim costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, concentrations of insurance risk could impact our ability to make property insurance available to our customers. This could adversely impact our volume of business and our results of operations or cash flows.\nStrategic Risks and Operational Risks\nThe personal lines insurance and annuity markets are highly competitive and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by competitive forces.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and compete with numerous insurance companies, as well as mutual fund families, independent agent companies and financial planners. In some instances and geographic locations, competitors have specifically targeted the educator marketplace with specialized products and programs. We compete in our target market with a number of national providers of personal automobile and property insurance and life insurance and annuities.\nThe insurance industry consists of a large number of insurance companies, some of which have substantially greater financial resources, more diversified product lines, more sophisticated product pricing, greater economies of scale and/or lower-cost marketing approaches compared to us. In our target market, we believe that the principal competitive factors in the sale of property and casualty insurance products are overall service, worksite sales and service, price and name recognition. We believe that for our market the principal competitive factors in the sale of annuity products and life insurance are worksite sales and service, product features, perceived stability of the insurer, price, overall service and name recognition. And, we believe that the Company's focus on the educator market niche, as well as the knowledge obtained regarding this niche throughout the Company's history, contribute to our ability to effectively and profitably serve this market.\nParticularly in the Property and Casualty business, our insurance subsidiaries have experienced pricing and profitability cycles. During these periods of intense competition, they may be unable to increase policyholders and revenues without adversely impacting profit margins. With respect to these cycles, the factors having the greatest impact include significant and/or rapid changes in loss costs, including changes in loss frequency and/or severity; prior approval and restrictions in certain states for price increases; intense price competition; less restrictive underwriting standards; aggressive marketing; and increased advertising, which have resulted in higher industry-wide combined loss and expense ratios. During the current cycle, and potentially beyond, competition from direct writers and large, mass market carriers has been particularly aggressive, evidenced in part by their significant national advertising expenditures. In addition, advancements in vehicle technology and safety features, such as accident prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles - once widely available and utilized, as well as expanded availability of usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile\ninsurance is marketed, priced and underwritten. The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to effectively anticipate the impact of these issues on our business and compete successfully in the property and casualty business could adversely affect the subsidiaries' financial condition and results of operations and the resulting ability to distribute cash to the Company.\nIn our Retirement business, the current IRS Section 403(b) regulations make the 403(b) market similar to the 401(k) market. These regulations have reduced and could continue to reduce the number of competitors in this market as the 403(b) market has become more attractive to some of the larger companies experienced in 401(k) plans, including both insurance and mutual fund companies, that had not previously been active competitors in this business. While not yet widespread, there has been continued pressure in some states to adopt state-sponsored or mandated 403(b) plans with single- or limited-provider options; this pressure has come from competitor lobbying efforts and state legislature-initiated pension reform initiatives. The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to compete successfully in these markets could adversely affect the subsidiaries' financial condition and results of operations and the resulting ability to distribute cash to the Company.\nIf we are not able to effectively develop and expand our marketing operations, including agents and other points of distribution, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's agencies are owned primarily by non-employee, independent contractor, EAs and nearly all of these agencies operate under the ABM - agents in outside offices with licensed producers - which is designed to remove capacity constraints while increasing productivity. The economic viability of each agency is directly dependent on the productivity of the agency and the success at penetrating, serving and cross-selling the Company's educator market.\nOur success in marketing and selling our products is largely dependent upon the efforts of our agent sales force and the success of their agency operations. As we expand our business, we may need to expand the number of agencies marketing our products. If we are unable to appoint additional agents, fail to retain high-producing agents, are unable to maintain the productivity of those agency operations or are unable to maintain market penetration in existing territories, sales of our products likely would decline and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to maintain and secure (1) access to educators and (2) endorsements and other relationships with the educational community, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully increase new business in the educator market is largely dependent on our ability to effectively access educators either in their school buildings or through other approaches. While this is especially true for the sale of 403(b) tax-qualified annuity products via payroll deduction, any significant decrease in access, either through fewer payroll slots, increased security measures, impacts of state or federal level pension reform initiatives, requirements of national and state Do Not Call registries, or for other reasons could adversely affect the sale of all lines of our business and require us to change our traditional approach to worksite marketing and promotion, as well as contact with potential customers. With the current IRS regulations regarding Section 403(b) arrangements, including annuities, our ability to maintain and increase our share of the 403(b) market, and the access it gives us for other product lines, will depend on our ability to successfully compete in this market. Some school districts and benefit consultants have placed an emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies, as well as low cost product and distribution approaches, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other more highly-rated insurance companies.\nOur ability to maintain and obtain product and corporate endorsements from, and/or marketing agreements with, local, state and national education-related associations is important to our marketing strategy. In addition to teacher organizations, we have established relationships with various other educator, principal, school administrator and school business official groups. These contacts and endorsements help to establish our brand name and presence in the educational community and to enhance our access to educators.\nEconomic and other factors affecting our niche market could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nHorace Mann's strategic objective is to become the company of choice in meeting the insurance and financial services needs of the educational community. With K-12 teachers, administrators, and support personnel representing a significant percentage of our business, the financial condition and results of operations of our subsidiaries could be more prone than many of our competitors to the effects of economic forces and other issues affecting the educator market including, but not limited to, federal, state and local budget deficits and cut-backs and adverse changes in state and local tax revenues.\nWhile the U.S. financial market and certain sectors of the economy have shown improvement over recent years, federal and state revenue shortages continue to pressure the budgets of many school districts. Teacher layoffs and early retirements have taken place and it is possible that additional reductions could occur. Similar to others in the insurance industry, the Company has experienced periods with pressure on new business sales levels. However, despite the economic headwinds, as of the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company's retention of annuity accumulated values remains strong with continued positive total annuity net fund flows. However, there can be no assurance that these business factors will remain favorable.\nIndividual states may impose additional cybersecurity regulations, increasing the complexity of compliance.\nIndividual state regulation of Cybersecurity programs are being adopted on a state by state basis to ensure the safety and soundness of the institution and protect its customers. New York State Department of Financial Services adopted a regulation providing minimum standards for an organization's Cybersecurity program and requiring an annual certification confirming compliance. Additional states may establish Cybersecurity regulations with varying compliance requirements.\nData security breaches or denial of service on our websites could have an adverse impact on the Company's business and reputation.\nUnauthorized access to and unintentional dissemination of our confidential, highly-sensitive customer, employee or Company data or other breaches of data security in our facilities, networks or databases, or those of our agents or third-party vendors - including information technology and software vendors, could result in loss or theft of assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption that may expose the Company to liability and/or regulatory action and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s customers, employees, investors, reputation and business. In addition, any compromise of the security of our data or prolonged denial of service on our websites could harm the Company\u2019s business and reputation. Additionally, the Company recognizes the increased external threats of data breaches in the marketplace resulting in non-public data of customers becoming increasingly available in the public domain. We have designed, implemented and routinely test industry-compliant procedures for protection of confidential information and sensitive corporate data, including rapid response procedures to help contain or prevent data loss if a breach were to occur and the evaluation of our customer\nidentification authentication programs. We have also implemented multiple technical security protections and contractual obligations regarding security breaches for our agents and third-party vendors. Even with these efforts, there can be no assurance that security breaches or service disruptions will be prevented.\nSuccessful execution of our business growth strategy is dependent on effective implementation of new or enhanced technology systems and applications.\nOur ability to effectively execute our business growth strategy and leverage potential economies of scale is dependent on our ability to provide the requisite technology components for that strategy. While we have effectively upgraded our infrastructure technologies with improvements in our data center, a new communications platform and enhancements to our disaster recovery capabilities, our ability to replace or supplement dated, monolithic legacy business systems - such as our Life, Retirement and Property and Casualty policy administrative systems - with more flexible, maintainable, and customer accessible solutions will be necessary to achieve our plans. The inherent difficulty in replacing and/or modernizing these older technologies, coupled with the Company's limited experience in these endeavors, presents an increased risk to delivering these technology solutions in a cost effective and timely manner. Our scale will require us to develop innovative solutions to address these challenges, including consideration of \"software as a service\" arrangements and other third-party based information technology capabilities. More modern approaches to software development and utilization of third-party vendors can augment the Company's internal capacity for these implementations, but may not adequately reduce the operational risks of timely and cost effective delivery.\nLoss of key vendor relationships could affect our operations.\nWe increasing rely on services and products provided by a number of vendors in the U.S. and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware and software, including on-demand software, and vendors of services such as investment management advisement, information technology services - such as those associated with our Life, Retirement and Property and Casualty policy administrative systems - and delivery services for customer policy-level communications. In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial losses.\nFinancial Strength, Credit and Counterparty Risks\nLosses due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect the value of our investments.\nThird-party debtors may not pay or perform their obligations. These parties may include the issuers whose securities we hold, customers, reinsurers, borrowers under mortgage loans, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure or other reasons.\nDuring or following an economic downturn, our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue. States are currently barred from seeking protection in federal bankruptcy court. However, federal legislation could possibly be enacted to allow states to declare bankruptcy in connection with deficit reductions or mounting unfunded pension liabilities, which could adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio.\nThe default of a major market participant could disrupt the securities markets or clearance and settlement systems in the U.S. or abroad. A failure of a major market participant could cause some clearance and settlement systems to assess members of that system, including our broker-dealer and Registered Investment Adviser regulatory entities, or could lead to a chain of defaults that could adversely affect us. A default of a major market participant could disrupt various markets, which could in turn cause market declines or volatility and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncollectible reinsurance, as well as reinsurance availability and pricing, can have a material adverse effect upon our business volume and profitability.\nReinsurance is a contract by which one insurer, called a reinsurer, agrees to cover a portion of the losses incurred by a second insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the second insurer. Our insurance subsidiaries obtain reinsurance to help manage their exposure to property, casualty and life insurance risks. Although a reinsurer is liable to our insurance subsidiaries according to the terms of its reinsurance policy, the insurance subsidiaries remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. As a result, reinsurance does not eliminate the obligation of our insurance subsidiaries to pay all claims, and each insurance subsidiary is subject to the risk that one or more of its reinsurers will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations.\nAlthough we limit participation in our reinsurance programs to reinsurers with high financial strength ratings and also limit the amount of coverage from each reinsurer, our insurance subsidiaries cannot guarantee that their reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all. Reinsurers may become financially unsound by the time that they are called upon to pay amounts due, which may not occur for many years.\nAdditionally, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control. For example, significant losses from hurricanes or terrorist attacks, an increase in capital requirements, or a future lapse of the provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act could have a significant adverse impact on the reinsurance market.\nIf one of our insurance subsidiaries is unable to obtain adequate reinsurance at reasonable rates, that insurance subsidiary would have to increase its risk exposure and/or reduce the level of its underwriting commitments, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of the subsidiary. Alternately, the insurance subsidiary could elect to pay the higher than reasonable rates for reinsurance coverage, which could have a material adverse effect upon its profitability until policy premium rates could be raised, in some cases subject to approval by state regulators, to incorporate this additional cost.\nAny downgrade in or adverse change in outlook for our claims-paying ratings, financial strength ratings or credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims-paying ratings and financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. In the evolving 403(b) annuity market, school districts and benefit consultants have placed an emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies. Each rating agency reviews its ratings periodically and from time to time may modify its rating criteria including, among other factors, its expectations regarding capital adequacy, profitability and revenue growth. A downgrade in the ratings or adverse change in the ratings outlook of any of our insurance subsidiaries by a major rating agency could result in a substantial loss of business for that subsidiary if school districts, policyholders or independent agents move their business to other companies having higher claims-paying ratings and financial strength ratings than we do. This loss of business could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of that subsidiary.\nA downgrade of the Company's debt rating also could adversely impact our cost and flexibility of borrowing which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nReduction of the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect their ability to write insurance business.\nInsurance companies write business based, in part, upon guidelines including capital ratios considered by the NAIC and various rating agencies. Some of these ratios include risk-based capital ratios for both property and casualty insurance companies and life insurance companies, as well as a ratio of premiums to surplus for property and casualty insurance companies. Risk-based capital ratios measure an insurer's capital adequacy and consider various risks such as underwriting, investment, credit, asset concentration and interest rate. If our insurance subsidiaries cannot maintain profitability in the future or if significant investment valuation losses are incurred, they may be required to draw on their surplus, thereby reducing capital adequacy, in order to pay dividends to us to enable us to meet our financial obligations. As their surplus is reduced by the payment of dividends, continuing losses or both, our insurance subsidiaries' ability to write business and maintain acceptable financial strength ratings could also be reduced. This could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries.\nAn inability to access Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny changes in requirements to retain membership in the FHLB, or changes in regulation, could impact our eligibility for continued FHLB membership or our FHLB funding capacity. Any event that adversely affects amounts received from FHLB could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Each jurisdiction has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. Furthermore, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. Regulation generally is designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and non-policyholder creditors. Such regulations, among other things, impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments our subsidiaries may hold. Certain states also regulate the rates insurers may charge for certain property and casualty products. Legislation and voter initiatives have expanded, in some instances, the states' regulation of rates and have increased data reporting requirements. Consumer-related pressures to roll back rates, even if not enacted by legislation or upheld upon judicial appeal, may affect our ability to obtain timely rate increases or operate at desired levels of profitability. Changes in insurance regulations, including those affecting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to distribute cash to us and those affecting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to write profitable property and casualty insurance policies in one or more states, may adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, consumer privacy requirements may increase our cost of processing business. Our ability to comply with laws and regulations, at a reasonable cost, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success.\nRegulation that could adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries also includes statutory surplus and risk-based capital requirements. Maintaining appropriate levels of surplus, as measured by statutory accounting principles, is considered important by state insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers' claims-paying abilities and financial strength. The failure of an insurance subsidiary to maintain levels of statutory surplus that are sufficient for the amount of its insurance written could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, action by state regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies.\nSimilarly, the NAIC has adopted a system of assessing minimum capital adequacy that is applicable to our insurance subsidiaries. This system, known as risk-based capital, is used to identify companies that may merit further regulatory action by analyzing the adequacy of the insurer's surplus in relation to statutory requirements.\nBecause state legislatures remain concerned about the availability and affordability of property and casualty insurance and the protection of policyholders, our insurance subsidiaries expect that they will continue to face efforts by those legislatures to expand regulations to address these concerns. Resulting new legislation could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries.\nIn the event of the insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of our insurance subsidiaries, our creditors and stockholders would have no right to proceed against any such insurance subsidiary or to cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of any such insurance subsidiary under federal or state bankruptcy laws. The insurance laws of the domiciliary state would govern such proceedings and the relevant insurance commissioner would act as liquidator or rehabilitator for the insurance subsidiary. Creditors and policyholders of any such insurance subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the assets of the insurance subsidiary before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution.\nThe financial position of our insurance subsidiaries also may be affected by court decisions that expand insurance coverage beyond the intention of the insurer at the time it originally issued an insurance policy.\nDodd-Frank created the FIO within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO studies the current insurance regulatory system and is charged with monitoring and providing specific reports on various aspects of the insurance industry. However, the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance. The FIO has suggested an expanded federal role in some circumstances. Management will continue to monitor developments under Dodd-Frank, as various aspects of it continue to be addressed by governmental bodies. Additional regulations could adversely affect the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, insurers of similar size and/or the insurance industry as a whole.\nRegulatory initiatives, including the enactment Dodd-Frank, could adversely impact liquidity and volatility of financial markets in which we participate.\nIn response to the credit and financial crisis, U.S. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities are considering or implementing enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or stabilize the institutions under their supervision. Such measures are leading to stricter regulation of financial institutions. Changes from Dodd-Frank and other U.S. and overseas governmental initiatives have created uncertainty and could continue to adversely impact liquidity and increase volatility of the financial markets in which we participate and, in turn, negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations. The executive branch has requested a review of financial regulations including Dodd-Frank, which may eliminate or mitigate this risk.\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rule and the possible adoption by the SEC of a fiduciary standard of care could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 6, 2016, the DOL released a final regulation which more broadly defines the types of activities that will result in a person being deemed a \"fiduciary\" for purposes of the prohibited transaction rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and Code Section 4975. Section 4975 prohibits certain kinds of compensation with respect to transactions involving assets in certain accounts, including IRAs.\nThe DOL rule was originally to be effective on April 10, 2017, but under a delay measure, the fiduciary definition went into effect on June 9, 2017, with certain conditions for prohibited transaction exemption relief delayed until July 1, 2019. The DOL is continuing its examination of the rule as directed by President Trump.\nIn its current form, the DOL regulation will affect the ways in which financial services representatives can be compensated for sales to participants in ERISA employer-sponsored qualified plans and sales to IRA customers, and it will impose significant additional legal obligations and disclosure requirements. The DOL regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While the regulation does not affect non-ERISA employer-sponsored qualified plans, such as public school 403(b) plans, it could have the following impacts, among others:\n\u2022\nIt could inhibit our ability to sell and service IRAs, resulting in a change and/or a reduction of the types of products we offer for IRAs, and impact our relationship with current clients.\n\u2022\nIt could require changes in the way that we compensate our agents, thereby impacting our agents' business model.\n\u2022\nIt could require changes in our distribution model for financial services products and could result in a decrease in the number of our agents.\n\u2022\nIt could increase our costs of doing IRA business and increase our litigation and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nIt could increase the cost and complexity of regulatory compliance for our Retirement segment's products.\nFurther, the SEC has announced its intention to formulate a standard of conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisers. This regulatory activity by the SEC also has the potential to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe NAIC has proposed amendments to its Suitability in Annuity Transactions model regulation, including incorporation of a requirement that a recommendation be in the consumer's best interest. In addition, Nevada passed a fiduciary statute, New York has proposed amendments to its suitability regulation, and other states are considering passing their own \"fiduciary rules\".\nLitigation may harm our financial strength or reduce our profitability.\nCompanies in the insurance industry have been subject to substantial litigation resulting from claims, disputes and other matters. Most recently, they have faced expensive claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging, among other things, improper sales practices and improper claims settlement procedures. Negotiated settlements of certain such actions have had a material adverse effect on many insurance companies. The resolution of similar future claims against any of our insurance subsidiaries, including the potential adverse effect on our reputation and charges against the earnings of our insurance subsidiaries as a result of legal defense costs, a settlement agreement or an adverse finding or findings against our insurance subsidiaries in such a claim, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries.\nChanges in regulations related to tax reform may impact our tax obligations and the rates needed to achieve our target rate of returns.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on insurance corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and such guidance could impact our results of operations in the period(s) issued. As a result, we have provided provisional estimates of the effect of the Tax Act in our financial statements as it relates to limited partnership investments and property and casualty loss reserves. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations.\nCalifornia's Insurance Commissioner has directed staff to review property and casualty insurers' rates to see whether, under the new 21% federal corporate tax rate, expected profits exceed the limits embedded in California's prior approval process. Various consumer advocacy groups have also called for premium reductions in light of tax reform. Any resulting changes in individual state regulations may slow down the Company's rate filing process or impede efforts to achieve profitability targets. In addition, the NAIC may choose to revise the RBC formula in response to the Tax Act which may change the amount of capital the insurance subsidiaries of the Company are required to hold.", "PERMNO": 77120, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "HMN"}
