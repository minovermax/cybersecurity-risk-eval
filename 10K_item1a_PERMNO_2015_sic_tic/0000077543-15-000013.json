{"cik": "77543", "company": "TUTOR PERINI Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Additional risks we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our backlog of uncompleted construction work was approximately $7.8 billion. We include a construction project in our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded, or a letter of commitment is obtained and adequate construction funding is in place. The revenue projected in our backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. For example, if a project reflected in our backlog is terminated, suspended or reduced in scope, it would result in a reduction to our backlog which could reduce, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and profits realized. If a customer cancels a project, we may be reimbursed for certain costs and profit thereon but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. Significant cancellations or delays of projects in our backlog could have a material adverse effect on future revenues, profits, and cash flows.\nA significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.\nAlthough economic conditions in the United States have gradually improved over the past two years following several challenging years during the aftermath of the global economic downturn in 2008, any significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions could result in renewed demand uncertainty across various parts of the country, particularly for new commercial building developments or renovations to existing infrastructure. In addition, any renewed tightness in the financial and credit markets could create difficulties for some customers, including certain private owners and state and local governments, to obtain adequate financing to fund new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all. These financing difficulties may significantly increase the rate at which our customers defer, delay, or cancel proposed new construction projects. Such deferrals, delays or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results.\nAny renewed instability or worsening conditions in the financial and credit markets could also impact a customer\u2019s ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already under construction in accordance with the contract terms. Customer financing may be subject to periodic renewals and extensions of credit by the lender. If credit markets tighten and challenging economic conditions return, lenders may become unwilling to continue renewing or extending credit to a customer. Such deferral, delay or cancellation of credit by the lender could impact the customer\u2019s ability to pay us, which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results. A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and New York. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations caused by adverse economic or other conditions in these states compared to others.\nReductions in the level of consumer spending within the non-residential building industry and the level of federal, state and local government spending for infrastructure and other public projects could adversely affect the number of projects available to us in the future.\nWith regard to the non-residential building industry, consumer spending is discretionary and may decline during economic downturns when consumers have less disposable income. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer and private industry spending in various business operations, as consumers may spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn. Decreased spending in the non-residential building markets could deter new projects within the industry and the expansion or renovation of existing facilities.\nWith regard to infrastructure and other public works spending, civil construction markets are dependent on the amount of infrastructure work funded by various government agencies which, in turn, depends on the condition of the existing infrastructure, the need for new or expanded infrastructure, and federal, state or local government spending levels. A slowdown in economic activity in any of the markets that we serve may result in less spending on public works projects. In addition, a decrease or delay in government funding of infrastructure projects or delays in the sale of voter-approved bonds could decrease the number of civil construction projects available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts, which could reduce revenues within our Civil segment. In addition, budget shortfalls and credit rating downgrades in states in which the Company is involved in significant infrastructure projects and any long-term impairment in the ability of state and local governments to finance construction projects by raising capital in the municipal bond market could curtail or delay the funding of future projects. Our Building segment is also involved in significant public works construction projects including healthcare facilities, educational facilities, and municipal and government facilities\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nprimarily in California and the southeastern United States. These projects also are dependent upon funding by various federal, state and local government agencies. A decrease in government funding of public healthcare and education facilities, particularly in those regions, could decrease the number and/or size of construction projects available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts in these markets, which could reduce our revenues and earnings.\nEconomic, political and other risks and the level of U.S. Government funding associated with our international operations could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nWe derived approximately 4% or $168.8 million of revenues and approximately $27.7 million of income from construction operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 from our work on projects located outside of the United States, including projects in Afghanistan, Guam, and the Philippine Islands. Our international operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business in certain hostile regions outside the United States, including: political risks, risks of loss due to civil disturbances, guerilla activities and insurrection; acts of terrorism and acts of war; unstable economic, financial and market conditions; potential incompatibility with foreign subcontractors and vendors; foreign currency controls and fluctuations; trade restrictions; logistical challenges; variations in taxes; and changes in labor conditions, labor strikes and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Failure to successfully manage risks associated with our international operations could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or limit our ability to generate revenues and income from construction operations in key international markets.\nThe U.S. federal government has approved various spending bills for the construction of defense- and diplomacy-related projects and has allocated significant funds to the defense of U.S. interests around the world from the threat of terrorism. The federal government has also approved funds for development in conjunction with the relocation of military personnel into Guam. However, federal government funding levels for construction projects in the Middle East have decreased significantly over the past few years as the U.S. government has reduced the number of military troops and support personnel in the region. As a result, we have seen a decrease in the number and size of federal government projects available to us in this region. Any decrease in federal government funding for projects in Guam or in other countries in which we are pursuing work may result in project delays or cancellations, which could reduce our revenues and earnings.\nCompetition for new project awards is intense and our failure to compete effectively could reduce our market share and profits.\nNew project awards are often determined through either a competitive bid basis or on a negotiated basis. Bid or negotiated contracts with public or private owners are generally awarded based upon price, but oftentimes take into account other factors, such as technical approach and/or qualifications, shorter project schedules, or our record of past performance on similar projects completed. Within our industry, we compete with many national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, we may need to accept lower contract margins or more fixed price or unit price contracts in order for us to compete against competitors that have the ability to accept awards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with the customer. If we are unable to compete successfully in such markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.\nThe construction services industry is highly schedule driven, and our failure to meet schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or expose us to financial liability.\nMany of our contracts are subject to specific completion schedule requirements and subject us to liquidated damages in the event the construction schedules are not achieved. Our failure to meet schedule requirements could subject us not only to liquidated damages, but could further subject us to liability for our customer\u2019s actual cost arising out of our delay and cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and customer base.\nWe will require substantial personnel, including construction and project managers and specialty subcontractor resources to execute and perform on our contracts in backlog. The successful execution of our business strategies is also dependent upon our ability to attract, retain, and implement succession plans for key officers.\nOur ability to execute and perform on our contracts in backlog depends in large part upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel, including project and construction management. In addition, our construction projects require significant trade labor resources, such as carpenters, masons and other skilled workers, as well as certain specialty subcontractor skills. In the event we are unable to attract, hire and retain the requisite personnel and subcontractors necessary to execute and perform on our contract backlog, we may experience delays in completing projects in accordance with project schedules, which may have a material effect on our financial results and harm our reputation. Further, the increased demand for personnel and specialty subcontractors may result in higher than expected costs, which could cause us to exceed the budget on a project. This, in turn, may have a material effect on our results of operations and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, if we lack the personnel and specialty subcontractors necessary to perform on our current contract backlog, we may find it necessary to curtail our pursuit of new projects. Although this\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrisk has been somewhat mitigated through the specialty contracting capabilities which we acquired in 2011, we still rely significantly on external specialty subcontractors to perform our projects.\nThe execution of our business strategies also substantially depends on our ability to retain the continued service of several key members of our management. Losing the services of these key officers could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement can be found. The majority of these key officers are not bound by employment agreements with us nor do we maintain key person life insurance policies for them.\nVolatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff who have received equity compensation. Additionally, because a substantial portion of our key executives' compensation is placed \"at risk\" and linked to the performance of our business, when our operating results are negatively impacted, we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key executives and managers compared to other companies that may pay a relatively higher fixed salary. If we lose our existing key executives or managers or are unable to hire and integrate new key executives or managers, or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key executives, our operating results would likely be harmed.\nWeather can significantly affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur ability to perform work is significantly affected by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Changes in weather conditions can cause delays and otherwise significantly affect our project costs. The impact of weather conditions can result in variability in our revenues and profitability.\nOur participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures by our partners.\nAs part of our business, we enter into joint venture arrangements typically to jointly bid on and execute particular projects, thereby reducing our financial or operational risk with respect to such projects. Success on these joint projects depends in large part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner\u2019s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to adequately address our partner\u2019s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation, reduce our profit on a project or, in some cases, result in a loss.\nWe are subject to significant legal proceedings which, if determined adversely to us, could harm our reputation, preclude us from bidding on future projects and/or have a material effect on us. We also may invest significant working capital on projects while legal proceedings are being settled.\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, including the legal proceedings described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to accurately predict what the final outcome will be of any legal proceeding. We must make certain assumptions and rely on estimates regarding potential outcomes of legal proceedings in order to determine an appropriate charge to income and contingent liabilities. Estimating and recording future outcomes of litigation proceedings requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future, which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. If the final recovery turns out to be materially less favorable than our estimates, we would have to record the related liability, which may include losses from money owed pursuant to an unfavorable judgment as well as losses based on the failure to receive an anticipated judgment for sums in our favor, and fund the payment of the judgment and, if such adverse judgment is significant, it could have a material adverse effect on us. Legal proceedings resulting in judgments or findings against us may harm our reputation and prospects for future contract awards. We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional cost exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material effect on our liquidity and financial results.\nOur contracts require us to perform extra, or change order, work, which can result in disputes and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows.\nOur contracts generally require us to perform extra, or change order, work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the work to be performed. This process can result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, over the price the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for a lengthy period of time until the change order is approved and funded by the customer.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlso, unapproved change orders, contract disputes or claims cause us to incur costs that cannot be billed currently and therefore may be reflected as \u201ccosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d in our balance sheet. See Note1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the section entitled Method of Accounting for Contracts of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. To the extent our actual recoveries with respect to unapproved change orders, contract disputes or claims are lower than our estimates, the amount of any shortfall will reduce our revenues and the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings recorded on our balance sheet, and could have a material effect on our working capital, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, as we include unapproved change orders in our estimates of revenues and costs to complete a project, our profitability may be diluted via the percentage-of- completion method of accounting for contract revenues. Any delay caused by the extra work may also adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates.\nThe percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenues involved significant estimates which may result in material adjustments, which could result in a charge against our earnings.\nWe recognize contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the project for the period to the total estimated revenues for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase or a reduction in or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, as applicable. Such credits or charges could be material and could cause our results to fluctuate materially from period to period.\nAccounting for our contract related revenues and costs, as well as other expenses, require management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Although we believe we have the experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on a contract, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on that contract.\nWe generally enter into three principal types of contracts with our customers: fixed price contracts, guaranteed maximum price contracts and cost plus fee contracts. We derive a significant portion of our Civil and Specialty Contractors segment revenues and backlog from fixed price contracts.\nCost overruns, whether due to inefficiency, faulty estimates or other factors, result in lower profit or even a loss on a project. If our estimates of the overall risks, revenues or costs prove inaccurate or circumstances change, we may incur a lower profit or a loss on that contract.\nWe are subject to a number of risks as a U.S. government contractor, which could harm our reputation, result in fines or penalties against us and/or adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe are a provider of services to U.S. government agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting. We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts which affect how we do business with our U.S. government customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulations allow our U.S. government customers to terminate our contracts for the failure to comply with regulatory requirements not directly related to performance and in certain cases, require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations.\nOur failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nOur pension plan is underfunded and we may be required to make significant future contributions to the plan.\nOur defined benefit pension plan and our supplemental retirement plan are non-contributory pension plans covering many of our employees. Benefits under these plans were frozen as of June 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2014, these plans were underfunded by approximately $35.0 million. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension and supplemental retirement plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by employee benefit and tax laws. The amount of any such\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequired contributions is determined based on an annual actuarial valuation of the plan as performed by the plans\u2019 actuaries. During 2014, we contributed $5.2 million in cash to our defined benefit pension plan and supplemental retirement plan. The amount of our future contributions will depend upon asset returns, then-current discount rates and a number of other factors, and, as a result, the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to these plans in the future may vary significantly. See Item 7. - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- in the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies.\nIn connection with mergers and acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and adversely affect our operating results. Assessing whether impairment has occurred requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future, which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and if actual events turn out to be materially less favorable than the judgments we make and the assumptions we use, we may be required to record additional impairments in the future.\nWe had approximately $685.3 million of goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. We test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or intangible assets should be evaluated. For example, if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets and would require us to further evaluate whether impairment has occurred. If we determine that there has been an impairment (meaning that carrying value exceeds fair value), we would be required to write down the carrying value by the amount of the excess (which would represent the impaired portion of these assets).\nImpairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to the assumptions used to project amounts included in the valuation process and as to anticipated future market conditions and their potential effect on future performance. Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the determination of fair value. If we determine, based on our assumptions, judgments, estimates and projections, that no impairment exists as of a specific date, and if future events turn out to be materially less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in assessing fair value when we tested for impairment, we may be required at a future date (either as part of a subsequent annual evaluation or on an interim basis) to re-evaluate fair value and to recognize an impairment at that time and write down the carrying value of our goodwill and/or intangible assets. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe forecasts utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis as part of our impairment test assume future revenue and profitability growth in each of our segments. If our operating segments cannot obtain, or we determine at a later date that we no longer expect them to obtain, the projected levels of profitability, future goodwill impairment tests may also result in an impairment charge. There can be no assurances that our operating segments will be able to achieve our estimated levels of profitability. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment testing. These factors include, but are not limited to; (i) renewed deterioration in the overall economy; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization; (iii) changes in the discount rate; (iv) successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v) adverse changes as a result of regulatory actions; (vi) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the overall business climate; (vii) recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of our reporting units; and (viii) the resolution of legal proceedings resulting in judgments less favorable than our estimates. Given these and other factors, we cannot be certain that goodwill impairment will not be required during future periods.\nBased on our annual review of our goodwill and intangible assets, which we performed in the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that no impairment had occurred. To the extent that the value of the goodwill or other intangible assets becomes impaired in the future, we will be required to incur non-cash charges relating to the impairment and recognized them in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nConflicts of interest may arise involving certain of our directors.\nWe have engaged in joint ventures, primarily in civil construction, with O&G Industries, Inc., a Connecticut corporation, whose Vice Chairman is Raymond R. Oneglia, one of our directors. In accordance with the Company\u2019s policy, the terms of this joint venture and any of our joint ventures with any affiliate have been and will continue to be subject to review and approval by our Audit Committee. As in any joint venture, we could have disagreements with our joint venture partner over the operation of a joint venture, or a joint venture could be involved in disputes with third parties, where we may or may not have a conflict of interest with our joint venture partner. These relationships also may create conflicts of interest with respect to new business and other corporate opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our chairman and chief executive officer, Ronald N. Tutor and two trusts controlled by Mr. Tutor (the \u201cTutor Group\u201d) owned approximately 17.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Under the terms of Mr. Tutor\u2019s employment agreement, he has the right to designate one nominee for election as a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors so\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nlong as the Tutor Group owns at least 11.25% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. As of the date of this Form 10-K, there are eleven current directors, one of whom was appointed by Mr. Tutor in November 2013. Mr. Tutor will be able to exert significant influence over the outcome of a range of corporate matters, including significant corporate transactions requiring a shareholder vote, such as a merger or a sale of the Company or its assets. This concentration of ownership and influence in management and Board decision-making also could harm the price of our common stock by, among other things, discouraging a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire shares of our common stock (whether by making a tender offer or otherwise) or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt agreements, in particular under our $300 million senior unsecured notes and our $250 million term loan under our revolving credit facility.\nWe currently have and expect to continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had a total debt of $865.4 million, consisting of $298.8 million of senior unsecured notes (net of unamortized debt discount of $1.2 million) (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), $130.0 million of outstanding borrowings on a revolving credit basis (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d), a $250 million term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) which has been paid down to $242.5 million at December 31, 2014, and $194.1 million of other debt. We may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur Senior Notes and revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to incur indebtedness from other sources without consent. Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum consolidated leverage ratios. Our ability to borrow funds for any purpose is dependent upon satisfying these tests.\nIf we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply with any of the other restrictions contained in these agreements, an event of default could occur. An event of default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, causing such debt to become immediately due and payable. If such acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay such indebtedness on a timely basis. Since indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and Senior Notes is secured by substantially all of our assets, acceleration of this debt could result in foreclosure of those assets. In the event of a foreclosure, we would be unable to conduct our business and may be forced to discontinue ongoing operations.\nSystems and information technology interruption and breaches in data security could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.\nWe are reliant on computer and information technology and systems to properly operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays. If we are unable to add required software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of and protect our systems, systems operation could be interrupted or delayed, or data security could be breached. If any of our key software vendors discontinue further development, integration, or long-term software maintenance support for our systems, or there is any significant system interruption, delay, breach of security, loss of data, or loss of a vendor, we may need to migrate our data to other systems. In addition, our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions, including breaches by computer hackers and cyber-terrorists. Any of these or other events could cause loss of critical data, delay or prevent operations, or result in the unintentional disclosure of information. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing state-of-the-art network and end-point security, internal control measures, and redundant backups of key data, a system failure or loss or data security breach could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.", "PERMNO": 50550, "SIC": 1540, "TIC": "TPC"}
