Therefore, we are indirectly subject to the business and financial risks of CHK. We have no control over CHK\u2019s business decisions and operations, and CHK is under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that is favorable to us.\nWe currently provide a significant percentage of our oilfield services and equipment to CHK and its working interest partners. For the 2016 Successor Period, the 2016 Predecessor Period and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, CHK and its working interest partners accounted for approximately 51%, 65%, 70% and 81% of our total revenues, respectively. If CHK ceases to engage us on terms that are attractive to us during any period, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected during such period. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business and financial risks of CHK, some of which are the following:\n\u2022\nthe volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which could have a negative effect on the value of CHK\u2019s oil and natural gas properties, its drilling program, its ability to finance its operations and its willingness to allocate capital toward exploration and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital on favorable terms to fund its exploration and development activities;\n\u2022\nits discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves and the speed at which it develops such reserves;\n\u2022\nuncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production;\n\u2022\nits drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\npipeline, storage and other transportation capacity constraints and interruptions;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation; and\n\u2022\nlosses from pending or future litigation.\nIn particular, CHK has generally made capital expenditures in excess of its operating cash flows. To fund these expenditures, CHK obtained capital from its revolving credit facility, the debt capital markets, oil and natural gas asset sales and other sources. If CHK is unable to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to fund its capital expenditures, CHK may be required to reduce its drilling and completion activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe serve customers who are involved in drilling for and producing oil and natural gas. Adverse developments affecting the oil and natural gas industry or drilling and completions activity, including sustained low oil, natural gas, or natural gas liquids prices, reduced demand for oil and natural gas products and increased regulation of drilling and production, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are generated from customers who are engaged in drilling for and producing oil and natural gas. Developments that adversely affect oil and natural gas drilling and production services could adversely affect our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe predominant factor that would reduce demand for our products and services is reduced land-based drilling and completions activity in the continental United States. Commodity prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, may significantly affect this level of activity, as well as the rates paid for our services. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated dramatically in recent years. We negotiate the rates payable under our contracts based on prevailing market prices for the services we provide. Declines in the prices of oil, natural gas, or natural gas liquids have had an adverse impact on the level of drilling, exploration and production activity since the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, and sustained low levels of drilling, exploration and production activity or further declines could materially and adversely affect the demand for our products and services and our results of operations. However, higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling and completions activity because our customers\u2019 expectations of future prices also influences their activity. Additionally, we have incurred costs and had downtime in the past as we redeployed equipment and personnel from one unconventional resource play to another to meet our customers\u2019 needs, and in the future we may incur redeployment costs and have downtime any time our customers\u2019 activities are refocused towards different drilling regions.\nAnother factor that would reduce demand for our products and services is a decline in the level of drilling and production activity as a result of increased government regulation of that activity. Our customers\u2019 drilling and production operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulations concerning emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases; hydraulic fracturing; the handling of oil and natural gas and byproducts thereof and other materials and substances used in connection with oil and natural gas operations, including drilling fluids and wastewater; well siting and spacing; production limitations; plugging and abandonment of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. More stringent legislation or regulation, a moratorium on drilling or hydraulic fracturing, or increased taxation of oil and natural gas drilling and completions activity could directly curtail such activity or increase the cost of drilling, resulting in reduced levels of drilling and completions activity and therefore reduced demand for our products and services.\nDemand for services in our industry is cyclical and depends on drilling and completion spending by CHK and other E&P companies in the U.S., and the level of such activity is cyclical.\nDemand for services in our industry is cyclical, and we depend on CHK\u2019s and our other customers\u2019 willingness to make capital and operating expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the U.S. Our customers\u2019 willingness to undertake these activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nprices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability, pricing and perceived safety of pipeline, trucking, train storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations relating to environmental matters;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, including hurricanes that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u2022\noil refining capacity;\n\u2022\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers;\n\u2022\ntax laws, regulation and policies;\n\u2022\nthe availability of water resources and suitable proppants in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms for use in hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022\nthe availability, capacity and cost of disposal and recycling services for used hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nthe political environment in oil and natural gas producing regions, including uncertainty or instability resulting from civil disorder, terrorism or war;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u2022\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise capital on favorable terms.\nAnticipated future prices for crude oil and natural gas are a primary factor affecting spending and drilling and completions activity by E&P companies, including CHK. Actual or anticipated lower prices or volatility in prices for oil and natural gas typically decrease spending and drilling and completions activity, which can cause rapid and material declines in demand for our services and in the prices we are able to charge for our services. Worldwide political, economic and military events as well as natural disasters and other factors beyond our control contribute to oil and natural gas price levels and volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future.\nWe negotiate the rates payable under our contracts based on prevailing market prices, and, consequently, the prices we are able to charge will fluctuate with market conditions. A material decline in oil and natural gas prices or drilling and completions activity levels or sustained lower prices or activity levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, beginning at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing throughout the majority of 2015 and 2016, we have experienced reductions in both the demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge as the sharp decline in oil prices has led our customers to reduce spending and cut costs. Industry activity is beginning to increase as the U.S. domestic rig count was 589 during the fourth quarter of 2016, which, while down 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, was up 22% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, the average price of oil during the fourth quarter of 2016 was $49.25 per barrel, which represented a 17% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and a 10% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016. These average oil prices remain well below the average prices in 2014. The average price of natural gas during the fourth quarter of 2016 was $3.04 per McF, an increase of 47% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016. Future price declines or prolonged levels of low prices would further negatively affect the demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge to our customers. Additionally, we may incur costs and have downtime during periods when our customers\u2019 activities are refocused towards different drilling regions.\nSpending by E&P companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause CHK and other E&P companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets in the future, even if oil or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling and completion programs as well as discretionary spending on wellsite services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge, and the utilization of our services. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, or a decrease in the development rate of reserves in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental or environmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling and completions activity or other factors, could also have an impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. An adverse development in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on our customers\u2019 operations or financial condition, which could in turn result in reduced demand for our products and services.\nOur current backlog of contract drilling and hydraulic fracturing revenue may not be fully realized.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the contract backlog associated with our drilling and hydraulic fracturing services was approximately $253.0 million, of which approximately 74% was with CHK. We calculate our drilling backlog by adding together (i) the day rate under our active rig contracts multiplied by the number of days remaining under the contracts and (ii) the implied daily margin rate on our IBC rigs multiplied by the number of days remaining on those contracts. We calculate our hydraulic fracturing backlog by multiplying the (i) rate per stage, which varies by operating region and is, therefore, estimated based on current customer activity levels by region and current contract pricing, by (ii) the number of stages remaining under the contract, which we estimate based on current and anticipated utilization of our crews. With respect to our hydraulic fracturing backlog, our contracts provide for periodic adjustments of the rates we may charge for our services, which will be negotiated based on then-prevailing market pricing and in the future may be higher or lower than the current rates we charge and utilize in calculating our backlog. Our drilling backlog calculation does not include any reduction in revenues related to mobilization or demobilization, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract. The contractual rate may be higher than the actual rate we receive because of a number of factors, including downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause downtime or a suspension of operations, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nbreakdowns of equipment;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, including labor strikes;\n\u2022\nshortages or material and skilled labor;\n\u2022\nsevere weather or harsh operating conditions; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure events.\nIn addition, many of our drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer. We calculate our contract drilling early termination value assuming each rig remains stacked for the remainder of the term of the terminated contract. As a result of the foregoing, revenues could differ materially from the backlog and early termination amounts presented. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that our customers will be able or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us. Liquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons. Many of our contracts permit early termination of the contracts by the customer for convenience (without cause), generally exercisable upon advance notice to us and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us. Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog amounts and early termination amounts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nkey suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization, the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh-start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the bankruptcy court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the plan of reorganization, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance, with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks, and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh-start accounting. Accordingly, our financial conditions and results of operations following our emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statement. Our financial results for future periods following the application of fresh-start accounting will be different from historical trends and such differences may be material.\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, our old common stock was cancelled and we issued New Common Stock. Our New Common Stock is not listed on any national or regional securities exchange or quoted on any over-the-counter market. Our New Common Stock is eligible to trade in the OTC Grey market. OTC Grey market securities do not have bid or ask quotations in the OTC Link system or the OTC Bulletin Board (\u201cOTCBB\u201d). Broker-dealers must report OTC Grey market trades to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), therefore trade data is available on http://www.otcmarkets.com and other public sources. Generally, trading in the OTC Grey market is much more limited than trading on any national securities exchange. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our common stock may be affected by, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our new capital structure as a result of the transactions contemplated by the plan of reorganization, our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our common stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh-start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those other risk factors described in this section. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for the common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock. The common stock may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. No assurances can be given regarding the Company\u2019s ability to be quoted on one of the over-the-counter markets or a national exchange in a timely manner or at all.\nOur industry is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully, our profitability may be reduced.\nThe market for oilfield services in which we operate is highly competitive. Price competition, rig or fleet availability, location and suitability, experience of the workforce, safety records, financial strength, reputation, operating integrity and condition of the equipment are all factors used by customers in awarding contracts. Our future success and profitability will partly depend upon our ability to keep pace with our customers\u2019 demands with respect to these factors. Our competitors are numerous, ranging from global diversified services companies to other independent marketers and distributors of varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers. The competitive\nenvironment could intensify if there is consolidation among E&P companies because such consolidation would reduce the number of available customers. The fact that drilling rigs and other oilfield services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry. In addition, any increase in the supply of land drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing fleets could have a material adverse impact on market prices under our contracts and utilization rates of our services. This increased supply could also require higher capital investment to keep our services competitive.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks, and we are not insured against all the risks we face.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards and risks, including the following:\n\u2022\naccidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property;\n\u2022\nliabilities from accidents or damage by our fleet of trucks, rigs and other equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other damage to the environment;\n\u2022\nexposure to toxic gases or other hazardous substances;\n\u2022\nwell blow-outs, the uncontrolled flow of oil, natural gas or other well fluids into or through the environment, including onto the ground or into the atmosphere, surface waters or an underground formation;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\nmechanical or technological failures;\n\u2022\nspillage handling and disposing of materials;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our employees to comply with our internal environmental health and safety guidelines.\nIf any of these hazards occur, they could result in suspension of operations, termination of contracts without compensation, damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others, or injury or death to our personnel or third parties and could expose us to substantial liability or losses. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In addition, these risks may be greater for us upon the acquisition of another company that has not allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and has a poor safety record.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business. For example, we do not have any business interruption/loss of income insurance that would provide coverage in the event of damage to any of our equipment or facilities. Although we are insured for environmental pollution resulting from environmental accidents that occur on a sudden and accidental basis, we may not be insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Please read \u201cBusiness-Risk Management and Insurance\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or the further weakening of the broader energy industry.\nA prolonged economic slowdown, another recession in the United States, adverse events relating to the energy industry and local, regional and national economic conditions and factors, particularly a worsening of the continuing downturn in the E&P sector, could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased spending by our customers.\nRestrictions in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operating and financial restrictions in our credit facility and term loans and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, or otherwise pursue our business activities. For example, our credit facility limits our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue guarantees;\n\u2022\nincur or permit certain liens to exist;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, acquisitions or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nprepay certain indebtedness.\nFurthermore, our credit facility contains a covenant requiring us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 based on the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to fixed charges when availability under the facility is less than 12.5%.\nA failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, would permit the exercise of remedies against us that would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Remedies under our credit facility and term loan include foreclosure on the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes operating assets and accounts receivable. Moreover, the existence of these covenants may also prevent or delay us from pursuing business opportunities that we believe would otherwise benefit us.\nOur assets may require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment.\nOur drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing fleets may require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain the competitiveness of our assets. Our rigs and fleets typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have fewer rigs and fleets available for service or our rigs and fleets may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our rigs and fleets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in a capital intensive industry and we may not be able to finance our capital needs.\nWe intend to rely primarily on cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility to fund our future capital expenditures. If our cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, we would be required to fund these expenditures through the issuance of debt or equity or alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nselling assets; or\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments, such as planned upgrades or acquisitions of equipment and refurbishments of our rigs and related equipment, even if previously publicly announced.\nThe terms of existing or future debt instruments and the terms of the Merger Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. If debt and equity capital or alternative financing plans are not available on favorable terms or at all,\nwe would be required to curtail our capital spending, and our ability to sustain or improve our profits may be adversely affected. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nShortages or increases in the costs of the equipment we use in our operations could adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts in place that provide for the delivery of equipment, including, but not limited to, drill pipe, replacement parts and other equipment. We could experience delays in the delivery of the equipment that we have ordered and its placement into service due to factors that are beyond our control. New federal regulations regarding diesel engines, demand by other oilfield services companies and numerous other factors beyond our control could adversely affect our ability to procure equipment that we have not yet ordered or cause the prices of such equipment to increase. Price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. In certain instances, we may have the ability to cancel purchases of equipment that may no longer be needed. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key raw materials and finished products.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with third party suppliers for many of the raw materials and finished products that we use in large volumes in our operations, including, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, proppants, acid, gels, including guar gum, chemicals and water, and fuels used in our equipment and vehicles. Especially during periods in which oilfield services are in high demand, the availability of raw materials and finished products used in our industry decreases and the price of such raw materials and finished products increases. We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key raw materials and finished products. Our reliance on such suppliers could increase the difficulty of obtaining such raw materials and finished products in the event of shortage in our industry or cause us to pay higher prices to obtain such raw materials and finished products. Price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to incur higher operating costs. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key executives could adversely affect our ability to effectively operate and manage our business.\nWe are dependent upon the efforts and skills of our executives to operate and manage our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these employees, and the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could increase our exposure to the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our personnel.\nWe may record losses or impairment charges related to idle assets or assets that we sell.\nProlonged periods of low utilization, changes in technology or the sale of assets below their carrying value may cause us to experience losses. These events could result in the recognition of impairment charges that reduce our net income. Please read Note 9 \u201cAsset Sales and Impairments and Other\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for more information, including a summary of impairment charges we have recognized previously. Significant impairment charges as a result of adverse market conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe unavailability of skilled workers could hurt our operations.\nWe are dependent upon the available pool of skilled employees to conduct our business safely, reliably and efficiently. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide the highest quality service. Historically, our industry has experienced high employee turnover rates as a result of both the physically demanding nature of the work and the volatile and cyclical nature of the oilfield services industry. For example, there have been significant reductions in employee headcount throughout the oilfield services industry due to low oil and natural gas prices since mid-2014. Particularly if the current downturn is prolonged, many of these workers may retire or pursue employment opportunities in other industries, many of which may offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit, train and retain an adequate number of workers to replace departing workers or that might be needed to take advantage of opportunities once the current business environment begins to improve. The inability to maintain an adequate workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nDuring periods of high drilling and completions activities levels, the demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited, and a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations have in the past, and could in the future, make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages thereby increasing our operating costs.\nAlthough our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, union organizational efforts could occur and, if successful, could increase our labor costs. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of groups of our employees could result in increases in the wage rates that we must pay. Likewise, laws and regulations to which we are subject, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. We cannot assure you that labor costs will not increase. Increases in our labor costs or unavailability of skilled workers could impair our capacity and diminish our profitability, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to obtain or implement new technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection or costly to obtain. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technologies or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Thus, limits on our ability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in obtaining permits by our customers for their operations could impair our business.\nOur customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and/or completion activities. Such permits are typically required by state agencies but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where such drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. Permitting delays, an inability to obtain new permits or revocation of our or our customers\u2019 current permits could cause a loss of revenue and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding issues of health, safety, climate change and protection of the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or other corrective measures. Any changes in laws or government regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, wetlands, endangered species, the environment, health and safety, waste management, waste disposal and transportation of waste and other materials. Our operations pose risks of environmental liability, including leakage or spills from our operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Environmental laws and regulations often impose strict liability and may impose joint and several liability. Therefore, in some\nsituations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Actions arising under these laws and regulations could result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures, and claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations also may include the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, revocation of permits, temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location, and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities could significantly delay or interrupt our operations.\nFor instance, in May 2016, the EPA issued final new source performance standards governing methane emissions, imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, storage, and transmission facilities. The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests to companies with production, gathering and boosting, gas processing, storage, and transmission facilities. In November 2016, the Department of the Interior issued final rules relating to the venting, flaring and leaking of natural gas by oil and natural gas producers who operate on federal and Indian lands. The rules limit routine flaring of natural gas, require the payment of royalties on avoidable gas losses and require plans or programs relating to gas capture and leak detection and repair. In addition, several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future federal and state regulations of the oil and natural gas industry remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nChanges in Federal and/or State Motor Carrier regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nFor several facets of our operations, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment that are required to comply with Federal and/or State Motor Carrier regulations. The U.S. Department of Transportation and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in various activities, safety, equipment testing and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, limits on vehicle weight and size and other matters. In 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) and the EPA published regulations governing fuel efficiency and GHG emissions from medium- and heavy-duty trucks, beginning with vehicles built for model year 2014. In October 2016, those agencies finalized a second phase of fuel efficiency and GHG standards for medium-and heavy-duty trucks as well as trailers used in combination with tractors. The EPA also regulates air emissions from certain off-road diesel engines that are used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these Tier IV regulations, we are required to retrofit or retire certain engines, and we are limited in the number of non-compliant off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Tier IV engines are costlier and are not always available. Until Tier IV-compliant engines that meet our needs are available, these regulations could limit our ability to acquire a sufficient number of engines to expand our fleet and to replace existing engines as they are taken out of service. As a result of these regulations, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, an impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of these vehicles and an increase in operating expenses. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes applicable to our trucking operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or government regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business, limit the areas in which our customers can operate and reduce oil and natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our business.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process is water-intensive and there has been increased public concern regarding the usage of water supplies for hydraulic fracturing, an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water, and the suitability of disposal outlets for fracturing fluids. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA\u2019s recent finalization of new source performance standard (\u201cNSPS\u201d) requirements for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations includes hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. The EPA also released the final results of its comprehensive\nresearch study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources in December 2016. The EPA concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. The results of the EPA\u2019s study could spur action towards federal legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations. For example, Congress has in recent legislative sessions considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. The U.S. Congress may consider similar SDWA legislation in the future. Several states where we conduct our water and environmental services business, such as Texas and Pennsylvania, have also either adopted or proposed laws and/or regulations to require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells. The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations. Apart from disclosure obligations, states have been imposing more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. Local governments likewise have been enacting restrictions on fracturing.\nFederal agencies have been pursuing a variety of initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing beyond the recent NSPS requirements. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance on February 11, 2014, addressing the performance of such activities in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. Also, in 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to solicit public input on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Further, the EPA proposed federal Clean Water Act regulations in 2015 that would govern wastewater discharges to publicly owned treatment works from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior has promulgated a final rule for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands in March 2015; however, these rules were struck down by a federal court in Wyoming in June 2016. An appeal of the decision is pending. Moreover, in June 2012, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (\u201cNIOSH\u201d) issued a joint hazard alert for workers who use silica (commonly referred to as \u201csand\u201d) in hydraulic fracturing activities. OSHA formally proposed to lower the permissible exposure limit for airborne silica in 2013, and it has prepared guidance identifying other workplace hazards resulting from hydraulic fracturing along with ways to reduce exposure to those hazards.\nThe process of hydraulic fracturing produces large quantities of wastewater that must be disposed of, leading to a significant increase in the number of disposal wells drilled in recent years. Unlike enhanced recovery wells and hydraulic fracturing, wastewater disposal wells are not accompanied by any withdrawal of fluids and, thus, have greater potential for pressure buildup, potentially increasing the likelihood of induced seismic activity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico and Arkansas. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed, most recently in Oklahoma, alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing.\nIf new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing activities are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and completions activities and make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed. The impact of such requirements could be materially adverse to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives, which may also reduce the demand for fossil fuels and our services.\nIn response to certain scientific studies suggesting that emissions of GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, are contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic conditions, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through measures to promote the use of renewable energy and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. In addition, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other GHGs endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Accordingly, the EPA has begun adopting rules\nunder the CAA that, among other things, cover reductions in GHG emissions from motor vehicles, permits for certain large stationary sources of GHGs, monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources, including oil and natural gas exploration and production operations. For instance, the EPA has adopted rules under the CAA for the permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V permitting programs. In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities.\nFinally, efforts have also been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, either directly or indirectly, any future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in areas where we operate could require us or our customers to incur increased compliance and operating costs. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas, which would result in a decrease in demand for our services. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced, including an increase in delays and costs. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations, but such effects could be materially adverse. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states likewise could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and thereby reduce demand for our services.\nSevere weather could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse weather can directly impede our operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of services;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u2022\nloss of productivity.\nThese constraints could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Unusually warm winters or cool summers may also adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas. Our operations in semi-arid regions can be affected by droughts and other lack of access to water used in our operations, especially with respect to our hydraulic fracturing operations.\nCybersecurity risks and threats could affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached, it could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, as well as disrupt our normal business operations and result in significant costs to remedy the effects of such incidents.\nA sustained failure of our enterprise resource planning systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe use enterprise resource planning systems to operate our business. A sustained failure of these systems could adversely affect our business by preventing us from:\n\u2022\nclosing our financials and preparing financial statements;\n\u2022\ntracking our repair and maintenance, payroll and other expenses;\n\u2022\ntracking fixed assets or purchase orders and receipts for supply chain purchases;\n\u2022\ngaining visibility of the financial performance at each of lines of business; and\n\u2022\nbeing able to properly manage the needs of our customers.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities of CHK following the spin-off.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of CHK\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spin-off is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. We have entered into a tax sharing agreement with CHK that allocates the responsibility for prior year taxes of CHK\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group between us and CHK and its subsidiaries. Please read \u201cBusiness-The Spin-Off-Agreements Between Us and CHK\u201d in Item 1 of this report. However, if CHK were unable to pay, we nevertheless could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to CHK pursuant to the master separation agreement could materially adversely affect our company.\nThe master separation agreement with CHK provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between our company and CHK resulting from the spin-off. For a description of the terms of the master separation agreement, please read \u201cBusiness-The Spin-Off-Agreements Between Us and CHK\u201d in Item 1 of this report. Among other things, the master separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make our company financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities incurred after the spin-off. If we are required to indemnify CHK under the circumstances set forth in the master separation agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we will be prohibited from making an indemnity claim until we first seek an insurance recovery.\nIn connection with our separation from CHK, CHK indemnified us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that CHK\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the master separation agreement and tax sharing agreement, CHK has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that CHK has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from CHK will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that CHK will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from CHK any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses. If CHK is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our spin-off from CHK, our historical financial information with respect to periods prior to June 30, 2014 is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition or future results of operations nor does it reflect what our financial condition or results of operations would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented.\nThe historical financial information prior to June 30, 2014 that we have included in this Form 10-K does not reflect what our financial condition or results of operations would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition or future results of operations. This is primarily a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nour historical financial results prior to June 30, 2014 reflect allocations of expenses for services historically provided by CHK, and those allocations may be significantly lower than the comparable expenses we would have incurred as an independent company;\n\u2022\nour historical financial results prior to June 30, 2014 reflect CHK\u2019s guarantee of utilization levels for our drilling rigs and following the spin-off such guarantee was terminated;\n\u2022\nour historical financial results prior to June 30, 2014 do not reflect various transactions that were effected in connection with the spin-off;\n\u2022\ncontracts with customers may be at less favorable rates than those in place under our arrangement with CHK prior to the spin-off;\n\u2022\nour cost of debt and other capitalization is different from that reflected in our historical financial statements; and\n\u2022\nthe historical financial information may not fully reflect the increased costs associated with being an independent public company, including significant changes in our cost structure, management, financing arrangements, cash tax payment obligations and business operations as a result of our spin-off from CHK, including all the costs related to being an independent public company.\nWe historically have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we do not maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\nA material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In prior periods we identified a control deficiency that constituted a material weakness. We did not design and maintain effective controls related to the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment. Specifically, we did not design a review precise enough to determine the accuracy and support of certain assumptions related to the property and equipment impairment assessments.\nDeficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are matters that may require an extended period to remediate. We will continue to evaluate, design and implement policies and procedures to address deficiencies to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting as a public company. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives will be met. These inherent limitations include system errors, the potential for human error and unauthorized actions of employees or contractors, inadequacy of controls, temporary lapses in controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight or resources, and other factors. Consequently, such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial results as required under SEC and any exchange rules, which could increase our operating costs or impair our ability to operate our business. Controls may also become inadequate due to changes in circumstances, and it is necessary to replace, upgrade or modify our internal information systems from time to time.\nIf management is not successful in maintaining a strong internal control environment, material weaknesses could occur, causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could lead to a decline in our stock price, limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future, and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC, Axar Capital Management, LLC and Mudrick Capital Management, L.P. currently own approximately 35.0%, 15.6% and 8.6%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, we have entered into a Stockholders Agreement with the Registration Rights Holders that provides for certain director nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership. Certain significant actions by the Company require the consent of one or more of the Holders. These actions include, but are not limited to, the issuance of equity securities of the Company representing more than 10% of the shares of New Common Stock issued pursuant to the Plan, the incurrence of indebtedness under the New ABL Credit Facility in excess of $275 million in the aggregate and other indebtedness in excess of $550 million in the aggregate, and the consummation of acquisitions greater than $100 million. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nMembers of our management may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of shares of common stock of CHK.\nMembers of our management own shares of common stock of CHK. This ownership could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and CHK.\nRisks Relating to our Pending Merger with Patterson-UTI\nThe pendency of the merger with Patterson-UTI could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn connection with the pending merger with Patterson-UTI, some of our customers or vendors may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the merger is completed. Similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the merger and which may materially adversely divert attention from the daily activities of our existing employees.\nIn addition, due to operating covenants in the merger agreement, we may be unable, during the pendency of the merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial to us. Further, the process of seeking to accomplish the merger could also divert the focus of our management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to it, without realizing any of the benefits which might have resulted had the merger been completed.\nFailure to complete the merger with Patterson-UTI could negatively impact our future business and financial results.\nWe cannot make any assurances that we will be able to satisfy all of the conditions to the merger or succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, the financial results of SSE may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we pay Patterson-UTI a termination fee of $40,000,000 in each case under certain circumstances provided in the merger agreement;\n\u2022\nthe payment of costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees, regardless of whether the merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe focus of our management team on the merger instead of the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to each company; and\n\u2022\nthe potential occurrence of litigation related to any failure to complete the merger.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. If the merger is not completed, we cannot assure you that these risks will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that limit each party\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, could discourage a potential competing acquiror from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal for us and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee to Patterson-UTI.\nThe merger agreement contains \u201cnon-solicitation\u201d provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, facilitate, knowingly encourage or induce or take any action that could be reasonably expected to lead to the making, submission or announcement of a proposal competing with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, while our board of directors has the ability, in certain circumstances, to change its recommendation of the transaction to their respective stockholders, we cannot terminate the merger agreement to accept an alternative proposal, and Patterson-UTI generally has an opportunity to modify the terms of the merger and the merger agreement in response to any alternative proposals that may be made before such board of directors may withdraw or\nmodify its recommendation. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay up to $7,500,000 of Patterson-UTI\u2019s expenses and we may be required to pay Patterson-UTI a termination fee of $40,000,000.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger with Patterson-UTI. In addition, these provisions might result in a potential third party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger with Patterson-UTI.", "PERMNO": 14683, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "SVNT"}
