{"cik": "1598014", "company": "IHS Markit Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described in this section. The risks described below are not the only risks that could adversely affect our business; other risks currently deemed immaterial or additional risks not currently known to us could also adversely affect us. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should read the section titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a description of the types of statements that are considered forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe operate in competitive markets, which may adversely affect our financial results.\nWhile we do not believe that we have a direct competitor across all of the industries we serve, we face competition across all markets for our products and services, including from larger and smaller competitors that may be able to adopt new or emerging technologies to address customer requirements more quickly than we can, from incumbent companies with strong market share in specific markets, or from organizations that have not traditionally competed with us but could adapt their products and services or use their significant resources or expertise to begin competing. We believe that competitors are continuously investing, developing, and enhancing their products, services, and technology, and acquiring new businesses to better serve existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, the internet, widespread availability of sophisticated search engines, and public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information and solutions have simplified the process of locating, gathering, and disseminating data, potentially diminishing the perceived value of our offerings. While we believe our offerings are distinguished by such factors as complex compilation, standardization and analytical processes, currency,\naccuracy and completeness, and our other added value, our customers could choose to obtain the information and solutions they need from public, regulatory, governmental, or other sources. An increase in our capital investments, price reductions for our offerings, reduced spending, or increased self-sufficiency by our customers due to competition could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in achieving our guidance, growth and profitability objectives.\nWe provide public, full-year financial guidance based upon assumptions regarding our expected financial performance, including our ability to grow revenue, our planned expenses and tax rates, and our ability to achieve our profitability targets. We seek to achieve our growth objectives by: organically developing our offerings to meet the needs of our customers; cross selling our products and services to existing customers; acquiring new customers; entering into strategic partnerships and acquisitions; and implementing operational efficiency initiatives. Most of our revenue is recurring, typically based on subscriptions to our offerings, and our operating results depend on our ability to achieve and sustain high renewal rates on our existing subscription base and to enter into new subscriptions at commercially acceptable terms. In addition, a proportion of our revenue in our Financial Services segment is variable and depends upon transaction volumes, investment levels (i.e., assets under management), or the number of positions we value. We devote significant resources to establish relationships with our customers, and our strategies depend on our ability to persuade customers to maintain and grow their relationship with us over time. Many of our products and services, particularly in our resources and financial end-markets, are also dependent upon the robustness of the core end-markets in which we operate, as well as the financial health of the participants in those markets and the general economy. Customers are focused on controlling or reducing their operating costs, and may use strategies that result in a reduction in their spending on our products and services, such as by consolidating their spending with fewer or lower cost vendors, by deferring capital spending, or by internally developing functionality. In addition, mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers, which could cause them to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and services. All such developments could lower demand or reduce the prices for our products and services or require us to offer additional products or services to compete. If we are unable to successfully execute on our strategies to achieve our growth objectives, retain existing customers, or if we experience higher than expected operating costs or taxes, our growth rates, profitability and operating results could be materially adversely affected and we may fail to meet the full-year financial guidance that we provide, or find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year.\nIf we are unable to identify opportunities, develop successful new products and services, or adapt to rapidly changing technology, our business could suffer serious harm.\nThe information services industry is characterized by significant and rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and changing regulatory requirements, and our growth and success depend on our ability to meet our changing customer needs. The process of developing and enhancing our products and services is complex and may become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms, operating systems, technologies, and customer expectations. Current areas of significant technological change include artificial intelligence, mobility, cloud-based computing, blockchain, speed of availability of data, and the storing, processing, and analysis of large amounts of data. We may find it difficult or costly to enhance our current products and services and to develop new products and services quickly enough to keep the pace with evolving technologies, industry standards or regulations, or to meet our customers\u2019 needs, in which case we may not grow our business as quickly as we anticipate.\nFraudulent or unpermitted access to our data, services, or systems, or other cyber-security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.\nMany of our products and services and systems involve the collection, storage, use, and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including data from our employees, customers and suppliers, intellectual property, proprietary business information, personally identifiable information, and information that may be confidential, sensitive, or material and nonpublic. Similar to other global companies that provide services online, we experience cyber-threats, cyber-attacks, and security breaches of varying degrees of severity on our products and our information technology systems and applications, which can include unauthorized attempts to access, disable, improperly modify or degrade our information, systems, and networks, the introduction of computer viruses and other malicious codes, and fraudulent \u201cphishing\u201d e-mails that seek to misappropriate data and information or install malware onto users\u2019 computers and our systems generally. Cyber-threats vary in technique and sources, are persistent, and increasingly are more sophisticated, targeted, and difficult to detect and prevent.\nWe rely on a system of physical and technological security measures, internal processes and controls, contractual precautions and business continuity plans, and policies, procedures, and training to protect the confidentiality of such data. We have dedicated resources at our company that are responsible for maintaining, and training our business teams on, appropriate levels of cyber-security, and we utilize third-party technology products and services to help identify, protect, and remediate our\ninformation technology systems and infrastructure against security breaches and cyber-incidents. Our information systems must also be constantly updated, patched, and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities and optimize performance. We may be required to incur significant costs to minimize or alleviate the effects of cyber-attacks or other security vulnerabilities and to protect against damage caused by future disruptions, security breaches, or cyber-attacks. However, our responsive and precautionary measures may not be adequate or effective to prevent, identify, or mitigate attacks by hackers, foreign governments, or other actors or breaches, disruptions, slowdowns or misconduct caused by employee error, malfeasance, or other third parties. In addition, if a customer experiences a data security breach that results in the misappropriation of our proprietary business information, our reputation could be harmed, even if we were not responsible for the breach.\nAny fraudulent, malicious, or accidental breach of data security controls can impact our ability to provide our products and services to customers, prevent authorized access to our systems by customers, suppliers, and employees or result in unintentional disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, or misappropriation or misuse of, customer, vendor, employee, or other confidential or sensitive data or information, which could potentially result in additional costs to our company to enhance security or to respond to occurrences, lost sales, loss of confidence in our processes and reliability, damages to our brand and reputation, violations of regulations or laws relating to the privacy of personal or payment card information, sanctions, fines, penalties, or litigation. Similarly, if any confidential or embargoed data is inadvertently disclosed or deliberately misused prior to our authorization, customers and financial markets could be negatively affected, and any resulting need to change our procedures for handling and sharing this data may diminish the value of such offerings. In addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third-party suppliers, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our reputation. We are also dependent on security measures that some of our customers and suppliers are taking to protect their own systems and infrastructures. For example, our outsourcing of certain functions requires us to sometimes grant network access to third-party suppliers. If our suppliers do not maintain adequate security measures, do not require their sub-contractors to maintain adequate security measures, do not perform as anticipated and in accordance with contractual requirements, or become targets of cyber-attacks, we may experience the same impacts as described above. If any of these were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we maintain what we believe is sufficient insurance coverage that may (subject to certain policy terms and conditions, including deductibles) cover certain aspects of third-party security and cyber-risks and business interruption, our insurance coverage may not always cover all costs or losses.\nWe could experience system failures or capacity constraints that could negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex systems, relying on people, processes, and technology to function effectively. Most of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process and deliver substantial quantities of information and other services on computer-based networks. Some elements of these systems have been outsourced to third-party providers, including critical data inputs received from third-party suppliers and data systems stored on cloud-based computing infrastructure. Some of our systems have been consolidated for the purpose of enhancing scalability and efficiency, which increases our dependency on a smaller number of systems. Any failure of, or significant interruption, delay, or disruption to, our systems could result in: disruption to our operations; significant expense to repair, replace, or remediate systems, equipment or facilities; a loss of customers; legal or regulatory claims, proceedings, or fines; damage to our reputation; and harm to our business.\nSystem interruptions or failures could result from a wide variety of causes, including: human error, natural disasters (such as hurricanes and floods), infrastructure or network failures (including failures at third-party data centers, by third-party cloud-computing providers, or of aging technology assets), disruptions to the internet, malicious attacks or cyber incidents such as unauthorized access, ransomware, loss or destruction of data (including confidential and/or personal customer information), account takeovers, computer viruses or other malicious code, and the loss or failure of systems over which we have no control. In addition, significant growth of our customer base or increases in the number of products or services or in the speed at which we are required to provide products and services may also strain our systems in the future. We may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity and increased costs associated with such usage. We may also face additional strain on our systems and networks due to aging or end-of-life technology that we have not yet updated or replaced. While we generally have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that utilize industry standards and best practices for much of our business, including back-up facilities for our primary data centers, a testing program, and staff training, our systems are not always fully redundant and such plans may not always be sufficient or effective. In the past when we have experienced system interruptions or failures, some of our products or services have been unavailable for a limited period of time, but none of these occurrences have been material to our business. However, any of the above factors could individually or in the aggregate adversely affect our business and results of operations, and our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all failures, interruptions, delays, or disruptions.\nOur transition to cloud-based technologies could expose us to operational disruptions.\nWe are transitioning our technology to cloud-based infrastructure, which is complex, time consuming, and can involve substantial expenditures. Our utilization of cloud services is critical to developing and providing products and services to our customers, scaling our business for future growth, accurately maintaining data and otherwise operating our business; any such implementation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. We may discover deficiencies in our design or implementation or maintenance of the new cloud-based systems that could adversely affect our business. Upon implementation of the new cloud-based solutions, failure of cloud infrastructure providers to maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs. There may also be a discrepancy between the contractual liability profile that the cloud service provider has agreed to and our contractual liability profile with our customers. Any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced suppliers could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems, and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service disruptions may increase. We may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions.\nDesign defects, errors, failures, or delays associated with our products or services could negatively impact our business.\nSoftware, products, and services that we develop, license, or distribute, or use to develop or provide our products and services, may contain errors or defects when first released or when major new updates or enhancements are released that cause the software, product or service to operate incorrectly or less effectively. We may also experience delays while developing and introducing new products and services for various reasons, such as difficulties in licensing data inputs or adapting to particular operating environments. Defects, errors, or delays in our products or services that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection or delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, loss of revenue, a lower rate of license renewals or upgrades, diversion of development resources, product liability claims or regulatory actions, or increases in service and support costs. We may also need to expend significant capital resources to eliminate or work around defects, errors, failures, or delays. In each of these ways, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe depend on externally obtained software, content, and services to support our offerings, and the interruption or cessation of important third-party content or services could prove harmful to our business.\nWe obtain data from a wide variety of external sources that we transform into critical information and analytics and use to create integrated product and service offerings for our customers. Many of our offerings include content and information that is purchased or licensed from third parties, including from public record sources or parties that are our customers or our competitors, or obtained using independent contractors. For instance, our industry standards offerings that are part of our Product Design workflow rely on information licensed from standards developing organizations, and many of our financial institution customers provide us with data that is a critical input for many of our Financial Services offerings. We believe that the content licensed from many of these third parties might not be able to be obtained from alternate sources on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur license agreements with these third parties are often nonexclusive and many are terminable on less than one year\u2019s notice. In addition, many of these third parties compete with one another and with us, including by providing data to our competitors, consolidating with each other, or becoming competitors themselves, which may cause them to reduce their willingness to supply, or increase the price of, data and content that are important to our products and services. Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with, or acquire, our data sources, which may preclude us from receiving data from such sources or restrict our use of such data. Our business, data sources, or content could become subject to legislative, regulatory, judicial, or contractual restrictions that limit or prohibit the way we collect, process, or use content or data sources in our products and services. Contracts with third-party content providers are increasingly subject to information and physical security and compliance audits. We also collect data for our products and services through independent service providers. We are limited in our ability to monitor and direct the activities of our independent contractors and customers, but if any actions or business practices of these individuals or entities violate our policies or procedures or are otherwise deemed inappropriate or illegal, we could lose access to content, as well as be subject to litigation, regulatory sanctions, or reputational damage. If we lose access to, or are restricted in receiving, a significant number of data sources and cannot replace the data through alternative sources, or we are unable to obtain information licensed to us consistently, in a timely manner, or on terms commercially reasonable to us, specific products, services, and customer solutions may be impacted or disrupted and our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nOur relationships with third-party service providers may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have commercial relationships with third-party service providers whose capabilities complement our own for integral services, software, and technologies. Many of our products and services are developed or are made available to our customers using integral infrastructure, information, and technology solutions provided by third-party service providers. For example, we outsource certain functions involving our data transformation process and data hosting functions to business partners, including cloud-computing providers, who we believe offer us deep expertise in these areas, as well as scalability and cost-effective services. In addition, we sometimes rely on third-party dealers to sell or distribute some of our offerings, such as in locations where we do not maintain a sales office or sales teams or for methods of distribution to which we do not have direct access. In some cases, these providers are also our competitors or may in the future become our competitors, which could impact our relationships. The priorities and objectives of these providers may differ from ours, which may make us vulnerable to changes in, or terminations of, our third-party relationships and could reduce our access over time to infrastructure, information, and technology. We have little control over these third-party providers, which increases our vulnerability to errors, defects, failures, interruptions, or disruptions or problems with their services or technologies. We also face risks that one or more service providers may perform work that deviates from our standards or that we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or protect the security of our confidential information and data. Any errors, failures to perform, interruptions, delays, breaches, or terminations of service experienced in connection with these third-party providers, or if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our relationships with third-party service providers, we may be less competitive, our products and services may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to comply with customer contracts or requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows.\nContracts with customers increasingly include performance requirements as customers seek to increase the liability profile taken by third-party providers like us. For example, contracts with customers are increasingly subject to audits, which may include a review of performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, information and physical security, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Contracts with governmental customers are also generally subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their performance. Many of our customers, particularly in the financial services sector, are also subject to regulations and requirements to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their third-party relationships, and provide rigorous oversight of relationships that involve certain \u201ccritical activities,\u201d some of which may be deemed to be provided by us. Any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts, policies or processes, or any violation of government contracting regulations or requirements, could result in the imposition of various penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, and, in the case of government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. Any negative publicity with respect to customer contracts or any related proceedings, regardless of accuracy, may damage our business by harming our ability to compete for new contracts. While no one customer contract is material to our business as a whole, if a significant number of our customer contracts are terminated, or our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.\nThe loss of, or the inability to attract and retain, qualified personnel could impair our future success.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the continued service of our highly skilled, educated, and trained employees, including our experts in research and analysis, information technology, and the industries in which we operate, and colleagues in sales, marketing, product development, operations, technology, and management, including our executive officers. We do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances. We must maintain our ability to attract, motivate, compensate, and retain highly qualified colleagues in order to support our customers and achieve business results. The markets we serve are highly competitive and competition for skilled employees in our industry is intense for both onshore and offshore locales, and uncertainty around future employment opportunities, facility locations, organizational and reporting structures, acquisitions and divestitures, and other related concerns may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of qualified personnel and any inability to recruit effective replacements or to otherwise attract, motivate, train, or retain highly qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. Any significant leadership change and accompanying senior management transition involves inherent risk, and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, execution, and future performance. While we strive to mitigate the negative impact associated with changes to our senior management team, such changes may cause uncertainty among investors, employees, customers, creditors, and others concerning our future direction and performance. If we fail to effectively manage our leadership changes, including ongoing organizational and strategic changes, our business, financial condition, operating results, and ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain highly qualified colleagues, could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology, processes, methodologies, and information. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure, license, assignment, and confidentiality arrangements to establish, maintain, and protect our proprietary rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license. However, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property, may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation, or theft of our intellectual property. Intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time, which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In particular, a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible. We may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct. To prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our intellectual property, we might be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation or other proceedings and we may not ultimately prevail. Courts, in particular, may be reluctant to enforce our proprietary rights against individual employees or contractors. Any failure to establish, maintain, or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to litigation related to products we make available to customers and we may face legal liability or damage to our reputation.\nCompanies in our industry have increasingly pursued patent and other intellectual property protection for their data, technologies, and business methods. As we do not actively monitor third-party intellectual property, if any of our data, technologies, or business methods are covered or become covered by third-party intellectual property protection and used without license or if we misuse data, technologies or business methods outside the terms of our licenses, we may be subject to claims or threats of infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property rights, or have the use of our data, technologies, and business methods otherwise challenged. We have also in the past been, and may in the future be, called upon to defend partners, customers, suppliers, or distributors against such third-party claims under indemnification clauses in our agreements. Responding to such claims or threats, regardless of merit, can consume valuable time and resources, result in costly or unfavorable litigation or settlements that could exceed the limits of applicable insurance coverage, delay operations of our business, require redesign of our products and services, or require new royalty and licensing agreements. It could also damage our reputation for any reason, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, employees, and information suppliers. Any such factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation and investigation risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are from time to time involved in various litigation matters and claims, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, lawsuits, governmental investigations, and contract disputes, as they relate to our products, services, and business. We may face potential claims or liability for, among other things, breach of contract, defamation, libel, fraud, antitrust, or negligence, with respect to the use of our offerings by our customers, particularly if the information in our offerings was incorrect for any reason, or if it were misused or used inappropriately. We may also face employment-related litigation and investigations, including claims of age discrimination, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, immigration violations, or other local, state, and federal labor, environmental, health, and safety violations. In addition, we may receive routine requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with their regulatory or investigatory authority or from private third parties pursuant to subpoena. In the past, certain of our business practices have been investigated by government antitrust or competition agencies, and we have on multiple occasions been sued by private parties for alleged violations of the antitrust and competition laws of various jurisdictions, and there is a risk based upon the leading position of certain of our business operations or the relationships between our customers in using our products and services that we could, in the future, be the target of investigations by government entities or actions by private parties challenging the legality of our business practices. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation, investigations, and insurance coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Litigation and investigations are very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation and investigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Depending on the outcome of future claims or investigations, we may also be required to change the way we offer, and how other parties purchase or interact with, particular products or services, which could result in material disruptions to and costs incurred by our business. In light of the potential time, expense, and uncertainty involved in litigation and investigations, including fines, penalties, damages, or injunctions or other equitable remedies, we may settle matters even when we believe we have a meritorious defense. We are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of\nexposure to loss or the amounts we actually pay in connection with litigation and investigation matters, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation, and other factors.\nOur use of open source software could result in litigation or impose unanticipated restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services.\nWe use open source software in our technology, most often as small components within a larger product or service. Open source code is also contained in some third-party software we rely on. The terms of many open source licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by U.S. or other courts, and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services, license the software on unfavorable terms, require us to re-engineer our products and services or take other remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of licenses, which could be costly for us to defend.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nThe integrity and external perceptions of our brand and reputation are key to our ability to remain a trusted source of products and services and to attract and retain customers. We also enter into redistribution arrangements that allow other firms to represent certain of our products and services as partners or agents. Reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity, or actual, alleged, or perceived issues regarding any of our products or services, or misrepresentation of our products and services by third parties, could damage our reputation and relationships with customers, prospects, and the public generally. Although we monitor developments, including social media, for areas of potential risk to our brand and reputation, negative perceptions or publicity or misrepresentations by third parties may adversely impact our credibility as a trusted source for critical information, analytics, and insight and may have a negative impact on our brand, reputation, and our business.\nFailure to operate our pricing and valuation services, benchmarks, and indices in a manner that maintains their independence and integrity could adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nWe operate multiple global pricing and valuation services, benchmark products, and indices across a broad range of commodities and asset classes, many of which depend on contributions or inputs from third parties or market participants. To ensure continued use of such products and services, our customers expect us to be able to demonstrate that they are not readily subject to manipulation. We believe our products and services are designed with appropriate methodologies, processes, and procedures to maintain independence and integrity; however, we may not be able to prevent third parties or market participants from working together or colluding to try to manipulate their inputs and thus the resulting outputs of our products and services. We may also become involved in third-party investigations or litigation related to the commodities and asset classes our products and services serve. Any failures, negative publicity, investigations, or lawsuits that implicate the independence and integrity of our pricing and valuation services, benchmarks, and indices could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these products and services and could harm our reputation and our business.\nSome of our products and services typically face long selling cycles to secure new contracts, which require significant resource commitments and result in long lead times before we receive revenue.\nFor certain new products and services, and especially for complex products and services, we often face long selling cycles to secure new contracts and customers, and there can be a long preparation period before we commence providing products and services. For instance, some of our Financial Services products and services can require active engagement with potential customers and can take 12 months or more to reach deal closure. Some products\u2019 success is also dependent on building a network of users and may not be profitable while such a network is developing. We can incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle, and we may not succeed in winning a new customer\u2019s business, in which case we receive no revenue and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. Selling cycle periods could lengthen, causing us to incur even higher business development expenses with no guarantee of winning a new customer\u2019s business. Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, transfer, publish, or sell data, subject us to increased regulation or decreased demand of our products and services, or prevent us from offering certain products or services, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nCertain types of information we collect, compile, store, use, transfer, publish and/or sell, and certain of our products and services, are subject to regulation by law and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate. There is an increasing public concern regarding, and resulting regulations of, privacy, data, and consumer protection issues. Certain types of information, including offerings in our Automotive businesses, are subject to laws and regulations by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations pertain primarily to personally identifiable information relating to individuals, and constrain the collection, use, storage, and transfer of that data, as well as other obligations with which we must comply. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation and civil or criminal penalties (including monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines) in one or more jurisdictions and reputational damage resulting in the loss of data, brand equity and business. To conduct our operations, we also move data across national borders and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security in an increasing number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), the cyber-security law adopted by China in 2017, and the 2020 California Privacy Act, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. It is possible that we could be prohibited or constrained from collecting or disseminating certain types of data or from providing certain products or services. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenues.\nMany of our customers rely on our products and services to meet their operational, regulatory, or compliance needs. Our financial industry customers, for example, operate within a highly regulated environment and must comply with governmental and quasi-governmental legislation, regulations, directives, and standards. In addition, our benchmark administration services have recently become regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, and we have been developing new products and services that will require regulatory approval and oversight in various jurisdictions. Complex and ever-evolving legislative and regulatory changes around the world that impact our customers\u2019 industries may impact how we provide products and services to our customers and may affect the development, structure and regulation of, and possibly the demand for, products and services we offer or develop, such as indices, benchmark administration, settlement, intermediating and clearing services, and offerings in which we function as a \u201cthird-party service provider.\u201d Changes in laws, rules, regulations or standards may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or standards, or fail to obtain regulatory approval to conduct certain operations or provide certain products or services, we could be limited in the types of products and services we provide or subject to fines or other penalties. Additionally, we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, rules, or regulations in various jurisdictions, or investigate, defend, or remedy actual or alleged violations, which could, individually or in the aggregate, result in materially higher compliance costs to us. New legislation, or a significant change in laws, rules, regulations, or standards could also result in some of our products and services becoming obsolete or prohibited, reduce demand for our products and services, increase expenses as we modify or develop products and services to comply with new requirements and retain relevancy, impose limitations on our operations, and increase compliance or litigation expense, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks relating to worldwide operations, and our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOperating in many jurisdictions around the world, we may be affected by numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal and regulatory regimes, including: changes in law or their interpretation (including trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including export controls and economic sanctions laws); changes in tax rates, holidays, incentives and laws, or their interpretation; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and political conditions and events. Different liability standards and legal systems, that may be less developed and less predictable than those in the United States and the United Kingdom, could limit our ability to provide services in specific countries and subject us to potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations. We must also manage social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region; restrictive actions by governments, including embargoes; difficulties in\nstaffing and managing local operations; difficulties with local or grassroots activism; difficulties in penetrating new markets because of established and entrenched competitors; uncertainties of obtaining data and creating products and services that are relevant to particular geographic markets; lack of recognition of our brands, products, or services; unavailability of local joint venture partners; restrictions or limitations on outsourcing contracts or services abroad; potential adverse tax consequences on the repatriation of funds and from taxation reform affecting multinational companies; and exposure to adverse government action in countries where we may conduct reporting activities. Because of the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights. Compliance with diverse legal and regulatory requirements is costly and time-consuming, and requires significant resources. Violations could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal and civil sanctions, including the restriction, suspension or revocation of an authorization, regulatory approval, license, recognition, exemption or registration that we rely on in order to conduct our business, and damage to our reputation.\nAs we operate our business around the world, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of export controls, anti-corruption laws or regulations, and other laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations. For example, the United States, the European Union, and other countries have imposed significant sanctions measures targeting the energy, defense, and financial sectors of Russia\u2019s economy and specific Russian officials and businesses. There is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Although we believe all our business activities are permissible under all current applicable laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations, we may be required to discontinue or limit our business activities in the future. Further, the implementation of new trade policies, treaties, tariffs, legislation or regulations, or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to operate, expand, and enhance our products and services as necessary to remain competitive and grow our business.\nOur ability to comply with applicable complex and changing laws and rules, including anti-corruption laws, is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, surveillance, audit, and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. We have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program intended to promote and facilitate compliance with all applicable laws, which includes employee training and the creation of appropriate policies and procedures defining employee behavior. We also have policies, procedures, and controls designed to comply with all applicable laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations and measure the compliance of our third-party providers. However, these measures may not always be effective, and we may fail to appropriately monitor or evaluate the risks to which we are or may be exposed or identify business activities that violate laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations. In addition, we may not always be successful in detecting if our employees, contractors, agents, and suppliers, including independent companies to which we outsource certain business operations, are engaging in misconduct, fraud, or otherwise taking actions in violation of our policies, procedures, and controls. In addition, some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of public information that may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date, or properly evaluated. In such cases, we could be subject to investigations and proceedings that may be very expensive to defend and may result in criminal enforcement actions, penalties for non-compliance, or civil actions or lawsuits, including by customers, for damages that could be significant.\nAny of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nLegal, political, and economic uncertainty surrounding the planned exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union are a source of instability and uncertainty.\nThe referendum in the United Kingdom in favor of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d could cause disruption to our business, including affecting relationships with existing and future customers, suppliers, and employees. The United Kingdom held an election in December 2019, resulting in a majority government that is expected to complete Brexit whether or not a formal withdrawal agreement is in place with the European Union. We are headquartered and tax domiciled in the United Kingdom and conduct business throughout the European Union primarily through our U.K. subsidiaries. The United Kingdom will cease to be a member state of the European Union by January 31, 2020, if not delayed, and will lose access to the E.U. single market and to E.U. trade deals negotiated with other jurisdictions at that time, so the long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the agreements or arrangements with the European Union for the United Kingdom to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Depending on the final terms of Brexit and the agreements or arrangements negotiated with the European Union, we could face\nnew regulatory costs and challenges. For instance, we may be required to move certain operations to other E.U. member states to maintain access to the E.U. single market and to E.U. trade deals. A decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the United Kingdom as a global investment center and have a detrimental impact on U.K. growth. Although we have an international customer base, we could be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater currency and economic volatility in the United Kingdom. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate, including U.K. competition laws. Changes to U.K. immigration policy related to Brexit could also affect our business. Although the United Kingdom would likely retain its diverse pool of talent, London\u2019s role as a global financial center may decline, particularly if financial institutions shift their operations to the European Union as the United Kingdom loses the E.U. financial services passport. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of Brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur international operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe operate in many countries around the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. In 2019, we generated approximately 40 percent of our revenues from sales outside the United States and approximately 20 percent of our revenue was transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets, and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including, but not limited to, the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar, and the Indian Rupee. As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses will likely be incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related products and services. An increase in the value of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income, expenses, and the value of assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nevertheless, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies can materially affect our net operating revenues, operating income, and the value of balance sheet items denominated in other currencies.\nInternational hostilities, terrorist or cyber-terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics, and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our customers and thus adversely affect our results of operations.\nActs of terrorism, cyber-terrorism, political unrest, war, civil disturbance, armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters (including hurricanes or floods), global health risks or pandemics, or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us. These events could adversely affect our customers\u2019 levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our employees, information systems, and our physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our third-party service providers or customers. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities, or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at our facilities or otherwise, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers. We may be unable to protect our employees, facilities, and systems against all such occurrences. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts, and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, or similar strategic relationships, or dispositions of our businesses, and the related integration or separation risks, may require significant resources or result in unanticipated costs or liabilities or fail to deliver anticipated benefits, and may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies, or joint ventures, partnerships, alliances, or similar strategic transactions and relationships with third parties, to support our business. We may also undertake dispositions of certain of our businesses or products. We seek to be disciplined in a highly competitive market and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on favorable terms to successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or strategic relationships, or dispositions. In addition, we typically fund our acquisitions through our credit facilities. Although we have capacity under our credit facilities, those may not be sufficient. Therefore, future acquisitions or strategic relationships may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in shareholder dilution.\nIf such acquisitions or other strategic transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits. Their success\ndepends on, among other things, our ability to integrate businesses in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and exceeds cost savings and revenue growth trends we have identified, which is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. We expect to benefit from cost synergies driven by a number of strategies, such as integrating corporate functions, using cost-competitive locations, optimizing IT infrastructure, real estate, and other costs, as well as greater tax efficiencies from global cash movement. We may also enjoy revenue synergies, including cross-selling of products and services, an expanded product offering, and balance across geographic regions. We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses, and completed strategic transactions may not perform at the levels we anticipate or achieve our expected cost or revenue synergies.\nThe completion of such transactions may have material unanticipated risks, difficulties, costs, liabilities, competitive response, and diversion of management focus and attention, such as: difficulties, delays, and expenses in integrating or remediating operations, systems, and technology and maintaining institutional knowledge and procedures; challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures, accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structures; challenges in keeping and developing business relationships; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of the company; impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets; disruption of operations; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; contingent liabilities (including contingent tax liabilities) that are larger than expected; and adverse tax consequences pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or other administrative guidance. The anticipated benefits from strategic transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized fully. We may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence, and could increase our exposure to risks of conducting operations in international markets. Similarly, any divestitures will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in the sale of businesses or assets. As a result, the failure of acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our indebtedness obligations and our other ongoing business obligations, which may result in defaults; events of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses; sensitivity to interest rate increases on our variable rate outstanding indebtedness, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly; reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, and the overall economy; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our indebtedness obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, for many reasons, including to fund acquisitions. If we add additional indebtedness or other liabilities, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nA downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nWe are party to a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement that matures in November 2024 (the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d). The cost of borrowing under the Senior Credit Facility and our ability to, and the terms under which we may, access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to us by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics and other measures of financial strength, business and financial risk, and other factors determined by the credit rating agencies. Our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. However, there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics and factors caused by our operating results or by actions that we take that reduce our profitability, or that require us to incur additional indebtedness for items such as substantial acquisitions, significant increases in costs and capital spending in security and IT systems, significant costs related to settlements of litigation or regulatory requirements, or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program. A downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the Senior Credit\nFacility, negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms, or at all, negatively affect the trading price of our securities, and have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program.\nIn October 2019, the Board approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the Board terminated our previous share repurchase program and authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion in common shares with a termination date of November 30, 2021. Under the share repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase our common shares on the open market from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions, or through accelerated share repurchase agreements, subject to availability of common shares, price, market conditions, alternative uses of capital, and applicable regulatory requirements, at management\u2019s discretion. Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow and borrowings. However, we are not required to declare dividends or to make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Any determination by the Board to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the future will be based upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and the continuing determination from the Board that the declaration of dividends complies with all applicable laws and agreements. As a result, in the future we may not choose or be able to declare or pay a cash dividend, and we may not achieve an annual dividend rate in any particular amount. Furthermore, the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any set dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. Additionally, the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common shares to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our shares. As a result, any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may not agree that, after the 2016 merger of IHS Inc. and Markit Ltd., IHS Markit should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and/or that we are not subject to certain other adverse U.S. federal income tax laws relating to certain transactions that we may undertake in the future. In addition, future changes to U.S. tax laws could adversely affect us.\nBecause IHS Markit is organized under the laws of Bermuda and is and has been treated as tax resident in the United Kingdom, we believe that we are, and have taken the position on our U.S. and non-U.S. tax returns, a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code (referred to as \u201cSection 7874\u201d). Section 7874 provides that if, following an acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a non-U.S. corporation, at least 80% of the acquiring non-U.S. corporation\u2019s stock (by vote or value) is considered to be held by former shareholders of the U.S. corporation by reason of holding stock of such U.S. corporation (such percentage referred to as the \u201cownership percentage\u201d and such test referred to as the \u201cownership test\u201d) and the \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d that includes the acquiring non-U.S. corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which the acquiring non-U.S. corporation is created or organized, then the non-U.S. corporation would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though it is a corporation created and organized outside the United States. In addition, if the ownership percentage is at least 60% but less than 80%, while the non-U.S. corporation will be respected as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain adverse U.S. tax rules would apply with respect to certain intercompany transactions and income.\nBased on the rules for determining the ownership percentage for purposes of the ownership test under Section 7874, we believe that the former IHS Inc. shareholders held less than 60% of our stock (by vote and value) after the merger by reason of holding IHS common stock, and therefore that IHS Markit should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and should not be subject to the adverse U.S. tax rules described above. However, there is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874, including the application of the ownership test. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes or otherwise subject to the adverse U.S. tax rules described above, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. income tax liability than if our status as a non-U.S. corporation were respected. In addition, if we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay to non-U.S. shareholders would be subject to U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30% (or a reduced rate under an applicable tax treaty).\nAudits, investigations, tax proceedings and future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to direct and indirect taxes in numerous jurisdictions, and tax laws, including tax rates, in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic, political, or other factors.\nWe calculate and provide for such taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. In complex transactions or jurisdictions, we regularly utilize third-party advisers to help us make judgments about the proper application of tax law. We have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of tax laws, but tax accounting often involves complex matters and judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with some of our interpretations of applicable tax law. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provisions. However, our judgments may not be sustained on completion of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded.\nOur tax liabilities and effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. For example, the U.S. Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), and other government agencies have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations, such as the comprehensive plan set forth by the OECD to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. The tax laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries in which we operate could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and changes in tax laws, treaties, or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent. Any of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our tax position and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our common shares, including enforcing judgments against us or our directors and executive officers.\nWe are organized under the laws of Bermuda as a Bermuda exempted company. As a result, our corporate affairs and the rights of holders of our common shares are governed by Bermuda law, including the Companies Act 1981 (the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d), which differs in some material respects from laws typically applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, amalgamations, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification of directors. Generally, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies typically do not have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances. Class actions are not available under Bermuda law. The circumstances in which derivative actions may be available under Bermuda law are substantially more proscribed and less clear than they would be to shareholders of U.S. corporations. The Bermuda courts, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal, or would result in the violation of the company\u2019s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by a Bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company\u2019s shareholders than that which actually approved it.\nWhen the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda, which may make such order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct of the company\u2019s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company. Additionally, under our bye-laws and as permitted by Bermuda law, each shareholder has waived any claim or right of action against our directors or officers for any action taken by directors or officers in the performance of their duties, except for actions involving fraud or dishonesty. In addition, the rights of holders of our common shares and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Bermuda law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the United States, particularly the State of Delaware. It is also doubtful whether courts in Bermuda will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United States, against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. Therefore, holders of our common shares may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction within the United States.\nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our bye-laws that may discourage a change of control.\nOur bye-laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions provide for: directors only to be removed for cause; restrictions on the time period in which directors may be nominated; our Board of Directors to determine the powers, preferences, and rights of our preference\nshares and to issue the preference shares without shareholder approval; and an affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of our voting shares for certain \u201cbusiness combination\u201d transactions which have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nThese provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders. As a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 90992, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "INFO"}
